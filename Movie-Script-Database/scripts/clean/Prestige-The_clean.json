{"Prestige-The": {"BORDEN": {"raw_line": "Are you watching closely? A SECOND BLACK CAT races into frame, HISSING, SPITTING, CHASING the first cat into the woods beyond and we-How much?Talk to Fallon, my ingenuer- the money's for him.I'd never forgive myself for selling my greatest trick. Borden signals the Wardens to come and unlock him.Fallon can take care of-Angier never learned my trick.We were too young men at the start of a great career...Two young man devoted to an illusion...Two young men who never intended to hurt anyone.Milton's squadering their goodwill or a bunch of tired second-hand tricks-What about something fresh? He won't even try a bullet catch-Fine- no bullet catch. But a real magician tries to invent something new, something other magicians scratch their heads over-No one else could do my trick.You don't even know what it is.Tickets are pricey.The most powerful theatrical agent in London.We've been practiced it-Look- he's all right. He's fine.Sharp lad, your son.You're the lucky one tonight. Borden walks to a wall of DOZENS of bird cages -- each one with an identical canary. He puts the bird into its cage and returns to the cart props. He taps on the top of the TABLE- a panel POPS open, revealing the FLATTENDED BIRD CAGE. Borden insefts a ROD into the bird cage and PRIES it apart. A TRICKLE of BLOOD emerges, dripping into a bucket below. Borden SLAPS the cage. And the FLATTENED CARCASS of the ORIGINAL BIRD slides out and SPLASHES into the bucket.Are you watching closely? Borden reaches to the Boy's ear. Casually produces a coin. The Boy marvels as he takes the coin then looks at Borden.Look closer.Never. Show. Anyone.They'll beg you and flatter you for the secret- but as soon as you give it up you'll be nothing to them. Understand? Nothing. The secret impresses no one- the trick you use it for is everything.Where do you two live?And you?Enough to keep me out?It is. He carries the bowl between his knees for the entire performance.Total devotion to his art... Utter self-sacrifice. It's the only way to escape this.We have our routine for Ackerman!Mr.Fallon is my ingeneur-Begged, borrowed and don't ask. Mr.Fallon's an enterprising soul.We'll start making money once we have our audience-You're...?The trick to wake up Ackerman at the end of my audition.No. The world isn't ready for that one, yet. Borden moves to the bureau and starts LOADING the gun. Pouring in SHOT, then WADDING...This is merely a run-of-the-mill daring and spectacular bullet catch- Borden drops the BULLET into the barrel...It's perfectly safe. Shoot me. Sarah looks at Borden then down at the pistol. She aims at Borden. Then sims off, at a mirror beside him. BANG. Borden's hand SNAPS out to \"catch\" the bullet. The mirror is intact. Borden looks at Sarah, grave, as he reveals the bullet in his hand.The bullet goes in the gun. Then comes the ramrod. He takes the RAMROD and PUSHES it down onto the bullet, which disappears.The buller's not even in the gun when the charge is fired.Yes, well, people still get killed perfoming it.Sme smart-arse drops something down the barrel.A penny, or a button. Or, of course, a bullet. But don't fret-I'm not letting anything happen- I love you too much.I love you.What?Bloody fool.How often I've fought with my self over that night .. one half of me swearing bling that i tied a simple slip knot... the other half convinced that I tied the Langford double. I suppose I'll never know for sure-\"How can be not know?!\"How could I not know? How can you read my story and not understand?They took her away?Tell him I've reconsidered.A volunteer.Are you man enought, sir?I'm sorry. I just need this to heal so I can het back to work.Some of the card pulls, prop tricks... And the trick I've been telling you about. The trick they'll remember me for.I love you.Guard! Guard!!Paper and pencil. Please.Perhaps I'm just biding my time. Perhaps one day I'll just hold up my-get you attention. Then quietlyMagic. Borden TURNS, NO LONGER CHAINED. Sullen JUMPS to his feet to follow, but HIS ANKLE IS CHAINED TO THE TABLE. The other PRISONERS are LAUGHING and CHEERING.I need a volunteer. Angier takes a few steps towards the stage. Borden produces a RUBBER BALL. he TOSSES the ball to Angier.As you can see , it's just a rubber ball. But it's not normal at all. Angier examines the ball. Hands it back to Borden who shows no sign of recognizing Angier.Thank you. Angier notices that two TALL BLACK CABINETS are standing twenty feet apart on the stage.It's a magic ball. Borden continues to BOUNCE the ball on the floor. The audience looks bored, waiting for something to happen.Would you like to see a magic trick?You caught me in the wrong mood.Sarah, I'm allowed to change my mind, aren't I? The act is taking off, maybe soon I'll get us into a bigger theatre. Things will work.We make do.I know who you are. Are you here to steal the rest of my show? Olivia sees one of the theatrical notices that litter the shop: \"THE GREAT DANTON BREAKS RECORD WITH HIS ASTONISHINGAnd what might that be?Why on earth shouldn't I trust you? The mistress of my enemy.Alfred.Ah. The truth. A slippery notion in our life of work, Miss Wenscombe.What does he need my secret for? His trick is top notch. The Great Danton vanishes and isntantly reappears on the other side of the stage -- mute, overweight, and, unless I'm mistaken, rather drunk.Tell me, Olivia. Does he like taking his bows under the stage?He has no secrets from me.And this is the truth?You are the Great Danton, aren't you?Just a humble admirer. And fellow practitioner.Another?You could probably do it blindfolded.Have it.Actually, there's something I might warn you about.Well, it's your Transported Man illusion. Now, I'm noit claiming to know your method... but I had a similar trick in my act- and I used... (looks around,At first. Then it went bad. You se, I hadn't counted on the fact that once I incorporated this bloke into my act, he had complete power over me.Great Danton, I must apologize! I simply had too much magic for my stage at the Pantages!Pardon my intrusion!Notebook. Fallon nods. Borden sighs. Weary.Then he's just getting started.I'm walking tonight, gentlemen. Fallon looks concerned.Let him come. I don't care. Borden doffs his hat and walks onto the crowd street. Fallon steps down, reaches into the bodyguard's jacket and pulls out a PISTOL. He checks that it's loaded and slips it into his own jacket. Then he sets off after Borden.I'm impressed.You're finally getting your hands dirty. This is what a good trick costs, Angier. Risk. Sacrifice.Which is?My secret?The keyword is the method.Where is my ingeneur?Absolutely. We're celebrating.Champagne. Your finestWell, we've hit upon a new trick, haven't we, Fallon?Who are you to tell me what?!It's my name.I'm not always at home.Sarah, I had a terrible ordeal today. I thought I'd lost something very precious to me.Secrets are my life, Sarah. Our life.Today, a most curious development...His assistent come to us with a proposition...Obviously Angier has sent her, and told her to admit as much...Tell me Olivia. Does he like taking his bows under the stage?He has no secrets from me.This is the \"truth\" you spoke of?I can spot Angier's methods from the back of the theatre. What could you possibly have to offer me? Olivia smiles, moves to Borden, reaching for his gloved hand. Borden flinches, surprised.I think she is telling the truth.I think we cannot trust her. But I love her. I need her. We need her.How could he send you away? He must be blind, deaf and dumb. She smiles quietly at this.Trust is not the point- love is the point... who have we ever trusted? To open myself to such a relationship,...to the dangers of such an affair... I need assurances of fidelity. Of love. Fallon is SHADOWING her from a distance.But how to be sure when truth is layered like the skin of an onion? I know a way... she must help me rid ourselves of Angier. It is the only way to kow her mind.Today my mistress proves her truthfulness. Not to me, you understand.I have been convinced since she led me to Root... today, Olivia proves her love for me to you, Angier.Yes, Angier. She gave you this noteboook at my request. Yes, she led me to Root, and yes, Tesla is merely the key to my dairy, not to my trick. Did you really think I would part with my secret so easily after so much? Good-bye, Angier, may you find solace for your thwarted ambition back in yout American home.Daddy's got some business this afternoon.Did I? Jess nods at him, solemly.Then go to the zoo we shall. Borden holds the newspaper open for her to look at.Who's that? A large advertisement features a picture of Borden: The Professor- England's premiere magician!Daddy has some errands to run. I'll be back before you know it, so get ready.Sarah. Whatever you may think, your only competitions for my affections is my little girl. I love you. I will always love you, and you alone. She looks into his eyes. Fascinated.Absolutely.More shopping. She doesn't like the smell of money, doesn't she? Fallon looks away. Borden tears up the paper.The little lady wants to visit the Zoo, I thought you could take her. I'll do it tomorrow, if not. Sarah... she knows. At least, she knows things aren't right. (looks at Fallon,Please don't call me that. It's nothing, just... sometimes things seem... wrong.I'm trying, Olivia. Please.You trust me? Then trust Fallon- he protects the things I care about.Angier's journal, the \"gesture of good faith\"? It's a fake.It has to be- it refers to events that happened after his death.It doesn't matter.My tricks. All of them.No he won't. They're not complete- you only have the Pledge and Turn for each.You'll get the rest after you bring my daughter here.I want to say goodbye.Stop it! Just stop it!Sarah, it's not true! I've told you Olivia means nothing to me!Sarah, you can't talk like this!Not today. Sarah takes this in. Borden watches, helpless.Who?Why would I talk about her to you?Part of me loved her. But part of me didn't. The part that found you. The part that's sitting here now. I love you. That is the truth that matters.He's back?Why only 100 performances? Do his methods dictate it, or is it simply a publicity move? Borden walks back and stares at the sketch.Fifty yards in a second. And all I know is that he uses a trapdoor. What's going on under that stage?They do this every night. After each performance? Fallon nods. Borden gets to his feet with a sigh. Turns to a POSTER on the wall- \"The Great Danton Perform THE REALWe're done. Let him have this trick. You're not to go back there. I don't need to know his secret. Leave him alone. Fallon puts on his hat with a shrug.I'm part of the act, you fool!For now.Jess, how are you?Are you alright?I've missed you. Fallon's missed you. We both have.Everything's going to be okay. It is only then that he notices the HAND ON HER SHOULDER. He rises to come face-to-face with Lord Caldlow-You must be Lord- -who is ROBERT ANGIER. Risen from the dead.I saw you die. Angier just SMILES.You were always afraid to get your hands dirty... (looks down at hisYou win. But don't take my little girl... Angier looks at Borden. BitterWait. Don't you want this? You paid for it.Angier! Let me say good-bye. Please.Soon. I promise. Soon.Daddy's coming, I promise. I promise.I promise.You think this place can hold me, Angier?Angier!We go alone now- both of us. Only I don't have as far to go as you.You were right. I should've left him to his damned trick... I'm sorry. I'm sorry for so many things. For Sarah. I didn't want to hurt her.Don't cry. Not for me. Go live your life in full. For both of us.We were both Fallon. And we were both Borden.We took turns. The trick is where we would swap...Simple, maybe. But not easy.Nothing easy about two men sharing one life. The second brother SWIGS from a gin bottle, then BITES down a padded stick as the first brother BRINGS DOWN THE HAMMER-We each loved one of them. We each had half a full life. Enough for us, but not for them. Borden puts the ball in his pocket. Tears in his eyes.Sacrifice, Robert- that's the price of a good trick. Borden looks down at Angier with contempt.But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Angier is dying. He opens his mouth to talk, but his voice is so wak that Borden has to stoop to hear him.It takes nothing to steal someone else's work.", "clean_line": "watching closely second black cat races frame

An enigma......Borden's cypher is simple- unraveled by a single word. Now it takes only patience. And a passion to know his mind.Quit a reception.As long as it takes.Not the welcome I was expecting.I've come to see Tesla.He built a machine for a- for a colleague of mine. A long time ago. Can you get me a meeting with him? I've come a very long way.I've brought a lot of money. Beat.I'll be staying at the hotel. Indefinitely. Alley watches Angier walk away. He pulls something from his pocket.Your watch.April 3rd, 1893... a few days after he first met me...He can't use plants for every trick.Actually, I do.I could.Show it to me twice, I'll do it.Why?Chung Ling Soo.Which is?Where's he from?He works for another magician? Aren't you worried he'll steal your tricks?How do you know?I don't know if I trust him.You think everyone's alright.You're wrong. It can't be.but look at the man!I can barely lift this thing and it's not even filled with water. Or fish. He must be strong as an ox.Any time he's in public. Any time he goes out. It's unthinkable.Borden saw it at once. I couldn't fathom it- living your whole life pretending to be someone else.I don't think changing your name compares.I promised my family I wouldn't embarrass them with my theatrical endeavors. Angier cuddles up to Julia.It's French.Borden writes as if no one but he understood the true nature of magic......but what does he know of self- sacrifice more than the rest of us?How can be not know?!He must know what he did. He must.Why are you here?My profession also deals in secrets.It's a rotating transposition that shifts every day of the dairy. Simple but time-consuming to translate once you have the five-letter keyword.We magicians have a circle of trust.Maybe I bought it.It's how we pay for our retirements and how greats tricks outlive us.I've already found it. That's why I'm here.Tesla built one for another magician.Call it a professional rivalry.I understand discretion. I just want the machine.I thought it was a secret.Where are the wires?Where's the generator?But that must be ten miles from here.Never thought I'd find an answer at the bottom of a pint glass.Who?You got me a booking? Why?Someone who know that it wasn't your fault. Someone who knows Alfred Borden and his repertoire of exotic knots.To die like that. Locked in water... lungs screaming...Which knot did Borden tie that night?Wouldn't say?!We should see about an assistant.Yes, I have. The Great Danton.No. It's sophisticated.The bird cage can't be our climax- everybody knows it.And I don't want to kill doves.You sound like him.I need a volunteer.Of course not.And one, two... THREE!Bloody marvelous, Cutter.Thought you said I had to get my hands dirty.Don't worry.You sir, in the hat. Could you show us your handkerchief?Perhaps you'd be so good as to return it to the other man. He has yours.The audience doesn't seem to be responding much, Cutter. Cutter puts he LEATHER HARNESS over Angier's arms...Wish us luc, Cutter.You've seen this one before?Well, I'll make it a little harder, shall I?Two volunteers, please. A lady and a gentleman to hold this cage with me...I'll perform this feat in a manner never before seen by yourselves or by any other audience anywhere in the worth...Any magician can make this cage disappear... that's why I'll ask this good lady and fine gentleman to place their hands firmly on the cage......to ensure that no trickery whatsover is employed.I should've spotted him.Don't suppose they'll let us do this one again.So what's the climax of our show?Mr.Merrit, we have a week's engagment-The name stays.I saw hapiness......hapiness that should have been mine. But I was wrong.Reading his account I realize that he never had the life I envied.The family life he craves one minute he rails against the next, demanding freedom. His mind is a divided one...His soul restless. His wife and child tormented by his fickle and contradictory nature...You've been sleeping here?Researching. Part of a magician's job is to watch his competition, to see what illusions they're-Even? My wife for a couple of his fingers? He has a child now. And he's perfoming again.He had a new trick.It was the greatest magic trick I have ever seen. Borden walks to one side of the stage and OPENS the door to one of the cabinets. It's empty. He CLOSES it again and crosses the stage, BOUNCING the ball the whole way. At the far cabinet, Borden repeats the process, OPENING the door to the empty cabinet. This time, however, he leaves the door open. He steps forwards and GENTLY BOUNCES the ball SIDEWAYS, across the stage... Borden STEPS into the CABINET behind him, CLOSING the door. With no one on stage, the audience watches as the ball continues to BOUNCE across the stage. BOUNCE. BOUNCE. BOUNCE. The ball loses seep and height... Just as reaches the second cabinet, something IMPOSSIBLE happens.Did they applaud when you saw it?He's a dreadful magician.How does he do it?I've seen his perfom ir three times now, Mr. Cutter- the Prestige is theThe same man comes out of the second cabinet. I promise you.He doesn't know how to sell his trick to an audience. But I do.The man stole my life. I'm going to steal his trick.He doesn't use a double-Take a good look- let's get out there and find me.I saw a lecture you gave in London, several years ago. I'm flattered you agreed to see me. Tesla keeps hold as Angier's hand.What's conducting the electricity?I need something impossible.If people thought the things I did on stage were real, they wouldn't clap- they'd scream. Think of saving a woman in half. Tesla nods. Considering.Price is not an object.I'm noit sure I follow.Have your obsessions done you no good?if you understand an obsession then you know you won't change my mind.Will you build it?He's out of his mind.I don't need him to be my brother. I need him to be me.It has to be. Borden's trick is getting noticed. The place was packed today.All I have to do is keep myself stinking drunk all the time and no one will be able to tell the difference.No point being coy. Borden calls his trick 'The Transported Man'? Cutter nods.Ladies and gentlemen, much of what you've seen tonight can be termed illusions. Entertaining trifles of the sort you may have seen other magicians perform.Alas, I cannot claim this next feat as illusion. Watch carefully- you will see no trickery, for no trickery is being employed. Merely a techique familiar to certain citizens of the orient and various holy men of the Himalyas. Indeed, some of you may be familiar with this technique, but for those of you who aren't, do not be alarmed, what you are about to see is considered safe...At least he got to see it. I spent the ovation hidden under the stage. No one cares about the man who disappears, the man who goes into the box. They care about the man who comes out the other side.Thank you.I suppose I should get more rest.The trick isn't good enough.No.It's not as good as his trick.He doesn't have to spend the finale hiding under the stage.I need to know how he does it.So that I can do it better. Angier turns to her. Looks her in the eye.I need you to go and work for him.You'll be my spy.It's how we advance. Angier moves to Olivia, placing his hands on her shoulders.Think of it, Olivia... we've got people excited about Cutter's version of the trick- imagine what we could do with the real illusion. We'll have the greatest magic act anyone's ever seen.Exactly why he'll want to hire you. He'll want my secrets.Because you're going to tell him the truth.I don't understand-We have a problem, Cutter. He holds up the paper, folded to an advertisement:He'll be perfoming right across the street.Don't tell me he fell over again.He's blackmailing us?How much does he want?What's the point?Pay him whatever he wants, for now. We keep doing the trick till Borden opens, then we'll phase it out.Cutter was always surprised how fast Root turned bad.We paid him enough to keep him in beer- you wouldn't expect him to rock the boat. Today I learned Borden's view on the episode......and his account suggests a reason....some of you may be familiar with this technique, but for those of you who aren't, do not be alarmed, what you are about to see is considered safe...Well, he did.No. I don't.He's the Great Danton. Let him cut himself down.You weren't expecting me?Well, it takes a bit for me to get around these days...He's taken everything from me. My wife, my career... now you.I sent you to steal his secret- not to improve his act-Or to fall in love with him!Of course Borden said that-All the time, Olivia- that's who he is, that's what it takes- he lives his act, don't you see?!You stole it?I can't.Olivia, no one could-Perhaps never. We'll see.You can'r possibly think I'd let this go? This is his diary, Olivia. All of his secrets are right here, in my hands.I need to know his method.I don't care about my wife- I care about his secret!Look, I'll go to his workshop and stage a break-in-Yes, me, not you. Understand?Then I know how hard this had been hard for you.Why's that?The sacrifice, I'm afraid, is all going to be yours. Unless you give me what I want.Your secret.Your method for the Transported Man. Fallon wouldn't tell me. In fact, he doesn't talk at all.Useless without the keyword.Write down your method Mr. Borden. Describe it in full.I want the method not the keyword- I don't even know if the secret is in you notebook.How fast can you gid?How's the arm?Our answer, Cutter. I haven't looked yet, I wanted you to share this.Well, let's find out, shall we?Then the rest is up to me.I thought I had the place to myself.No?I've veen played for a fool!Tesla never made a machine like the one I asked for.You let me believe that he had, Alley!You stole my money because your funding was cut off- you've been shooting sparks at my top hat, laughing at me all along while you use my money to stave off ruin. I've seen Edison's men-In the hotel. I've every mind to bring them up here myself-Then why isn't the machine working?Where did my top hat go?I'll go. Angier limps after the cat.Here, kitty, kitty.So the machine was working?Which one is mine?What box?Tesla's warning is as unheard as he knew it would be. Today I tested the machine...Taking precautions in case Tesla hadn't ironed out the kinks in its operation......if it went wrong I would not want to live like that for long...But here, at the Turn, I must leave you, Borden...Yes, you, Borden. Sitting there, in your cell, reading my diary. Awaiting your death. For my murder.I heard about a booking... Cutter turns. Angier is behind him, leaning on his cane. Beside Angier is a SECOND BLIND STAGEHAND.Nice little theatre. Good up-and- coming magician.It's a good to see you, John. Cutter sizes Angier up. Looks around the theatre.I need your help, John. My last show. A limited engagement.A wise man once told me that obsession was a young man's game. I'm almost done. One thing left... The real Transported Man.i don't want you backstage, I need you front of house, managing.i need you calling in any favours and connections you have left to get us the right booking for the run.The sort that Borden can't ignore. Cutter looks at Angier. Nods.Pleased to meet you, Mr. Ackerman.Are you interested in helping us?Ladies and gentlemen, my first trick of the evening is one that involves considerable risk. Anyone in the audience who would be irrevocable damaged by seeing a man drown should leave now, for when I tell you that the young lady who taught performing it, you will understand the seriousness of the danger involved.In my travels I have seen the future, and it is a strange future indeed. The world is on the brink of new and terrifying possibilities. The audience RECOILS in terror as the MACHINE is STARTED and BOLTS fly from it. SMOKE drift over the audience. Borden inches forward in his seat. Angier stands in front of the machine, silhouetted by the FRENZY of electricity behind him. He TOSSES his cane to his assistant and steps into the machine. The audience SCREAMS as large bolts BLAST from the machine and wrap themselves around ANGIER'S ARMS and legs. Borden is watching very carefully. Angier is almost impossible to see as the machine builds to a climax, but, just before it does; Borden catches a glimpse of ANGIER'SMan's reach exceeds his IMAGINATION! The audience breaks into a MASSIVE STANDING OVATION.You found him.I told you, John- I don't want you backstage on this one.Disposing of the Prestige materials.Do you really want to know? Cutter considers Angier's grave tone.They flatter you with all those chains, Alfred. Don't they know you can't escape without your little rubber ball? Borden says nothing.All I wanted to do was prove that I was the better magician. But you couldn't leave me alone.No. Not anymore. And I win. Because no one cares about the man in the box, the man who disappears.I know how hard it is to have someone so precious taken away, don't IBorden? But you can't take her with you know, can you? She'll be looked after. Good-bye, Professor.Your secret.You always were the better magician, Borden. We both know that. HE TEARS the envelope in half. Then again. And again...But whatever your secret was, you'll have to agree-For God's sake, Borden.Hello, Cutter.I magician never reveals his secrets.Good night, Jess.She needs looking after-You don't have to. I'm going to make sure the machine. is never used again.My theatre. It belongs with the Prestige materials.Cautions as ever, Cutter. No one's going to use the place. I own it.It's a good thing I retired early then. Angier puts the lattern and his cane on the lif of the crate and the two men heft ir off the platform.We'll put it down the end. Angier and Cutter move into the darkness with the crate. From the small pool of light afforded by the lattern, we can see that they are navigating their way through a large space filled with LARGE GLASS BOXES. They arrive at the end and set the crate down.Cutter, I tried not to involve you. Cutter looks at Angier. Nods. Then disappears into darkness.A brother. A Twin.You were Fallon. The whole time... Fallon/Borden's face disappears as Cutter seals his coffin.Were you the one who went into the-or the one who come back out?Cutter knew. But I told him it was too simple. Too easy.What about Olivia? And your wife?It takes everything.It took courage to climb into that machine every night...Not knowing if I'd be the Prestige....Or the man in the box...Nothing? You never understood, id you? Why we did this?It was the look on their faced.", "clean_line": "cypher enigma borden cypher simple unraveled single word takes patience passion know mind quit reception long takes welcome expecting

id look faced"}, "OLIVIA": {"raw_line": "What's so hard about this? Cutter leans into the cabinet and pops up a TRICK PANEl in the floor, revealing a tiny chamber.I'm so nervous- I'm sorry, I'm making mistakes. Cutter quickly REMOVES Angier's coat...I don't really.... have anywhere to go. Angier slips the newspaper from the table.Cutter said it would be okay till we get another booking.You're going to do something to that man, aren't you? Olivia moves closer. Angier is quiet.Cutter's hopig you'll let things life. He says if Borden thinks things are even between you then we can-Us. Olivia moves towards him.You're going to need a better disguise. Olivia reaches for Angier's beard.What happened?What happened, Robert?Was it good?It is the same man. They both turn to look at Olivia.He wears padded gloves to hide his damaged fingers, but if you look closely you can tell. Angier looks at Cutter.Mr. Angier, Mr. Cutter, I would like you to meet Mr. Gerald Root.He's an out-of-work actor- of course he's out of his mind.You walk through this one- then...?Oof. Couldn't you find a softer one?And Root goes up through there?It's going to be amazing, Robert.You went and saw his show again?You becoming obsessed, Robert.I care about the man in the box. Angier turns to Olivia, raises his glass.Life is not full of these moments, Robbie.We've worked hard for this, and we need to celebrate properly.What's wrong?Didn't you see the audience?Well, they loved it.Borden's trick is nothing compared to ours. He doesn't have any style-Why?Work for him? Are you jokingWhy would he trust me? Angier thinks for a second. Then smiles.My name is Olivia Wenscombe.No. I'm here to give your show what is missing.Me.I've left Angier. I want a job. Borden sits there.I know you have no reason to trustMr.Borden-Alfred. I'm going to tell you the truth.I'm here because he sent me here. He wants me to come and work for you and steal your secret.No. It's killing him. he's obsessed with discovering your method. He thinks of nothing else, and takes no pleasure in our sucess. I've had enough. There's no future with him. He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've actually come to offer you his.I was expecting you sooner, Robbie. Your message said \"afternoon\".What do you mean? You sent me to-That's my job-!You abandoned me to him!I did everything you asked.Cutter was right- it's a double.He didn't say anything- he'd never say. I've seen things- make-up, glasses, wigs. We don't use any of it for the show, but I've found it hidden backstage.All the time? He doesn't know whenYou thing you can see everything, don't you?But the Great Danton, is a blind fool.His notebook.I borrowed it for tonight. I thought you'd be able to translate some of it, but now I realize-And without the keyword?No, we won't- if I don't get that back tomorrow morning, he'll know I took it.He knows where I live!He'll know it was you-Robert? I have fallen in love with him. Angier looks at her, sympathetic.What trick, Freddy?Good-night, Mrs.Borden. Good-night, Freddy.No. It's killing him. He's obssessed with discovering your method. he thinks of nothing else, and takes no pleasure in our success. I've had enough. There is no future with him. He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've actually come to offer you his.No. This is what he told me to tell you. Beat.The truth is that I loved him. And stood by him. And he sent me to you like he'd send a stagehand to pick up his shirts. I hate him for that. They sit there in silence, appraising each other.You may know he does his tricks... but you can't understand why no one can see that yours are better. She tenderly PEELS OFF his padded glove revealing his mutiladed hand.You hide this. I had to look closely to spot it when you performed the Transported Man. But this makes you unique... it shows the audience that you aren't using a double; You musn't hide it, you must display it proudly... I'm sure it takes great skill to perform illusions with one good hand.Then let people know. You can be so much more then he is. I can show you how. Borden looks into her eyes.Robbie's blinded by his jealosy. He'd do anything for you secret. Sending me away was the least of it. Borden considers this.What is it. Freddy?Freddy, I've told you before. When you're with me, you're with me. Leave your family at home where they belong.I'll get dressed.I saw Fallon hanging around my house again, after you left.There's something about him I don't trust.You haven't spopken about her, Freddy. Not once.Don't be cruel.Because she was part of your life and now she's gone.She wanted to meet me the day before she killed herself. Said she had something to tell me about you.You could be sitting in some other restaurant talking to some other woman about me that way. It's unhuman to be so cold.By the way, have you seen who's opened at the Pantages? The Great Danton.After two years. And he has a new trick. They're saying it's the best that London's ever seen.If you could see the look on your face, Professor. You should go to him- you deserve each other.
