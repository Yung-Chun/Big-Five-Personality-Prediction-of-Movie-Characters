And Terri just happens to be one helluva shortstop.You wanna know the sad part? Technically I outrank her. But if we want any peace at all on Mars Two, I'm gonna be saying a lot of \"Yes, dears.\"I wish we were all going. Together.Oh, you're not gonna bring that up again --You just can't let that go --Bullshit, we would've made a great crew.Yeah, who landed the crippled Block II Shuttle?Let it go, Luke.You read the same damn science fiction books that I did! You're just not man enough to wear jewelry!You want Flash. You know you want him. Well you'll have to come through me!Internal combustion, boys. Accept no substitutes.Jim, if there's ever... if there's anything Terri and I can do --See you when I get to Mars, Luke. Don't solve all the mysteries of the universe, okay? Leave a little something for the next guys.You got it.\"Problem: Hatch door malfunction, backup power fail, manual override fail. Solution: Replace circuit breaker 907B.\"Okay... Piece of cake.God, who dreams up these nightmares?I'm not! We're talking about your sister's wedding, right?Honey, do you mind? I've got a catastrophic power failure here.I danced with you at our wedding.Face it, honey, some couples dance, some go to Mars. That's life.If they see me dance, they'll know there's something wrong.Phil, c'mon! We just started this drill.What do you mean, \"intense\"?What about the REMO? It went into Mars orbit last week. Maybe that could give us some clue.Show us whatever you've got.But that energy pulse they picked up in New Mexico...Causing this kind of damage? I don't buy it. We're missing something here.Other than the computers, how do we think the ERV fared?Which means it's gonna be up to us to get new motherboards, drives, and software to Mars. As fast as we can.Luke needs us now.Good idea Phil. If SIMA tells us Luke hasn't survived and it's not safe to land, we swing around Mars and come right back home.He's right, Ray. We've got a real shot.Chief, could I have a word?I've no longer got the right crew.Bjornstrom is a geologist. He's good, but not for this. My people just lost eight months of training. This is a different mission, with a different objective.But when you are, it ought to be given the best chance for success. I want McConnell to fly right seat.Yeah. Because you washed him out.Ray, he's the best pilot I ever saw, and you've got him benched at a desk.Maggie was his wife. He didn't want to lie on a couch and share her with strangers.His wife wasted away in front of his eyes. What was he supposed to do? Suck it up? Get with the program? What was his crime? That he was upset? That he cried...?When Maggie died, yeah, it knocked the shit out of him. It knocked the hell out of all of us. But you know and I know that he's still the best we've got. He and Maggie wrote the book on Mars. He's got more hours in the sims than the rest of us put together. Ray, we can do this. Give me McConnell as co-pilot, and we will bring Luke home. And that's a promise.Take a look.What do you make of that?Headed for Chryse Planitia.We'll have to be ready to move fast. Maybe even advance our ETA. Those things can cover the whole planet, and last up to a year.Tomorrow morning, about 0600. That's when we find out whether we came all this way for nothing.Zero-G. My last chance to be graceful. Once we're in Mars gravity, it's back to shuffling my feet and grabbing her butt.Looks deserted.Check the radiation levels.Go to the disaster site.Go to infrared.Then what the hell was it?Maggie was always starstruck...After that, NASA training was tough. All Jim could think about was exploring a heavenly body. More ribald LAUGHTER, asMission accomplished!Let's hear it for the newly-announced Captain and Co-Captain of Mars One. To Jim and Maggie!You okay?You know what? She may have been right.If that wasn't a quake down there, then something else caused it. Or planned it... You're thinking the same thing.Jesus. You realize what this means?Yeah, and we're not leaving until we find out... Deal?Maggie was the best of us.Okay, people let's look sharp. If we overshoot, there's no coming back.Charge primary APU.Select HPU fuel cells for run.Charge flow.Reset PW.MicrometeoroidsKill those alarms!Computer, how long until zero atmosphere?Everybody switch to suit oxygen. We beat this in the simulator, we can do it here. Jim, you've got the ship. I'm going EVA.C'mon, people, let's go! Let's work the problem!Jim, how we doin' on the AG?Get some light on the hole so I can locate it.I'm topside, Jim, do you know which sector?Jesus, uh, OK, this is gonna be like searching for a needle in a haystack.C'mon, c'mon, where are you...?Copy, I' heading there now.Sonofabitch. You never did that in the simulator.Whoa.Jim, there's a lot of scarring... I'd better check for other punctures while I'm out here.Copy, I'm heading there now.Hey, Beautiful...Know what? You've got enough left.Well. Easier than the cha-cha.OK, we're ready to light this candle. Go/No Go for braking burn and MOI. Engines?Systems.Nav.We are Go for the burn. I'm fueling the engines.Jim?What the --Engines negative! No response! I've got no attitude control!Negative! The CM doesn't have enough thrust to correct this rotation!How much time've we got?Jim, we're dead stick, there's no way to maneuver this ship into a link-up!Prepare to abandon ship.On my mark, seven percent left thruster. Three, two, one, fire.Okay. Let's go.I'm at fifty percent. But I don't see the REMO.Jesus. She's not where I thought she'd be.We can't catch it. Not like this.It'll be better if I leave you the gun while I run out to the REMO. I've got enough fuel left for that.I'll aim to overshoot, then brake like hell; arc it in.Seeya in a few.Okay. I'm on path to overshoot. I'm gonna take the edge off.I'm out. Coming in hot. Still long. Abandoning the unit. I'll brake with suit jets.Suit jets gone. But I'm gonna make contact...Impact's gonna be a little rough.Thirty-two.No! You slow me and I'll fall short.No choice. I'll be okay. Here we go...Uh, well, no suit jets and I'm still carrying a good deal of velocity.Uh, I'd have to say negative on that, Jim.No, I heard you. Negative on the maneuver. I am not retrievable.It comes down to the amount of fuel, honey. The suit jets were designed for attitude control, not travel. Retrieval just won't work.Hey, believe me, I don't like it any more than you do.Run the numbers, Jim.Sounds good, Jim.You listen to Jim, honey. It's a good plan.Will do, Jim.Hey, Beautiful...Terri, what are you doing?Terri --No. I wouldn't come for you. Not if it just wasn't possible.No, Terri, you can't! You don't have enough fuel to get me, stop us both, and get us back. Hell, you come any farther and you won't have enough to get back yourself.Listen to me, goddammit! You have to stop! You have to stop now!Okay, honey...? You gotta go back now.What are you doing?Terri, you spend any fuel getting closer, you won't get back, and if anyone tries to get you, they'll die too.Honey, please go back. Go back and help everyone get down to the surface.I can't let you do it. I can't. I'm sorry.I love you, Terri.

After that I was helpless.Something like that. It's his night, Deb. I didn't want to spoil it.That was never gonna happen. I was always teamed with Maggie, and we were mostly chalkboard jockies. You know? Systems. Payloads...Sure, I made a little noise. But putting the first footprints on Mars? Nah. That's for guys who... ...wrote their Ph.D. thesis on how to colonize the place. And guys who... ...read too much science fiction as a kid and still wear little Flash Gordon rocketships around their necks.God, she would've loved to see you two clowns. Just one more time.I'm okay. Really. Thanks.That's all over now.I know that, Luke. You don't have to say it... Mars is yours now. Go get it.Yeah. You too.Tell geology and hydrology we need to scramble on this. Full-court press.Ah, we're all pretty stoked about that formation you spotted, Mars One. The folks in the geology and hydrology back rooms are going over your images and comparing them to every photomap they've got.Medical wants me to remind you that you're three days late on your blood tests. I know they're a bore, but you've got to get them done, or else... or else I don't know what. Just do them, okay?I think that's about it for business. But on a personal note, be advised that, ah, none of you can sing worth a damn.Honestly, Luke, if you guys don't have anything better to do with your time, I can make some suggestions to mission medical. There are worse things than blood tests.Oh, and I talked to Debra. She and Bobby are doing fine. Said to tell you, they're, ah, they're on their \"third time through the book, page -- -- page 125.\" They send their love and say take care of yourself. Same from us here, buddy. Till next time, then. End of transmission.At the same moment we lost the data stream, they picked up an intense burst of energy from Mars.Catastrophic.Good thinking, Woody. That's just what we tried next.The Resupply Module checked out fine. No instrument failures, no change in status. Orbit holding steady. But there was something else. The REMO'S computer contained an uplink message -- a very faint, highly distorted transmission from Mars One Base Camp.Yes.Even if Luke was in great shape, he couldn't get home. That energy pulse would've fried the ERV'S computers.Right, but meanwhile, we've gotta be working up a mission plan.Yes. We can design the mission to have a free return capability. It's a long trip, but if you don't land it's the best option.But we can go earlier and get there faster if we reconfigure the payload for extra fuel. We've modelled that, Ray. I've modelled it.The ship can take it.I know the protocols for a Mars Recovery Mission better than anybody, because I helped design them. And I'm saying these guys can do it.You'll have it by 0600.Let's get to work.What's that?Used to be.Now what is it?I'm gonna get an update on SIMA. It should be just about close enough to start capturing some surface images.Hey, Skip.Dust storm. Southern hemisphere, coming from the east... Big fella, too.Yup. Could get a little hairy just about landing time...When does SIMA do her fly-by?My money's on Luke.It's SIMA.We know Luke survived for at least a few hours. Question is, are there any signs of recent activity?Graves.What's wrong?That was no quake.Yeah. I'm good to go.After all these years... Can you believe it? Tomorrow we'll be standing on Mars.It's never been out of my mind.She knew, Woody. She was the only one of us that ever thought there might be something down there.Range 6783 and closing. 35 minutes till Mars Orbital Capture.Tie main bus to systems.Select H2/O2 HPU and fuel cells for open.Transfer protocol data from EVA station.Breach hits in the hull!Still outgassing in the lower Hab! There must be another hole down there, even bigger.We'll lose all control. We won't be able to fire the engines to capture Mars orbit.No time. Phil, can you keep the nav computers on-line?I'll do it from below.Has that ever been tested?Do it.Just one goddamn second. Come on, c'mon...McConnell!Hang on!I've got a better idea. Stay there!I'm workin' on it!Shake out the liquid.Shake it out near the hull!Woody, the breech is in sector four! Sector four, copy that?Negative, negative. Woody, get back inside. We've gotta start the checklist for orbital insertion.How's his hand?Go.Let's go to Mars.Shut down engines!Manual separation! Blow the bolts!Where's the REMO?Where is it?!Damn it, how close?!We don't have time! Figure it out! Now!Not the ship. Just us. We have to go EVA.There's no other choice! Phil, how close?!How we doin' on fuel, Woody?What do you think?Use the tether.We'll only have one, maybe two shots before she's out of reach.You'll be going too fast.At what velocity?At what velocity?I'm gonna use the gun to slow you.It's too fast, Woody.Woody, what's your status?As soon as we get hooked up, I'll come get you.Negative on the transmission?I am.Woody, you hang tight. We'll get into the REMO, fire her up, drop her into a lower orbit and come scoop you up.Then we'll have to get her moving faster.Look out!Brakes!Okay, let's get inside! Phil, start dumping the cargo, or there won't be room for us.Dump the cargo. Hang on, Woody!Terri, no!Goddammit, Terri, it won't work!Get inside. Dump the cargo, then start the systems. Now.He's right, Terri... It's no use.Come back, Terri.He's gone.Please, Terri... We need you.Phil? Hey, Phil...?We're going in blind. We'll deploy the chutes by laptop. I need to get on the data bus, put in a software patch, and try to soften this tin can's landing. I could use your help with the patch.That's great. Good job. Hey, Terri, I was wondering. Think maybe we could rig some kind of seatbelts out of those cargo straps?Better?Terri, let's see if that oxygen still is operational. Phil, you better check out the ERV. I'll take the Hab. If you find Luke's --Just keep in touch.I'm at the main airlock door.Entering Hab.I'm in the greenhouse. You better... you better come see this for yourselves.Luke, it's me! Jim McConnell!Luke, it's Jim!Your wife is Debra! Your son is Bobby! You were reading Treasure Island with him...!Don't hurt him!He didn't make it Luke.Luke, what happened here?What came?Luke, we still don't understand.Or maybe his whole crew died and he's been marooned alone on Mars. Let's give him time to adjust.That kind.Has it been blowing like this for a while? We saw a big storm from space. But Micker said it was turning south.This -- whatever it was -- this force. You say it came directly out of the top of the mountain?What did you mean by its \"secret?\" What secret?Who's \"they\"?What about the sound? That signal you heard before the explosion?Mathematical?X-Y-Z coordinates...But that DNA looks human.Yeah, but it's close. Damn close.It's been a long day. Let's get a couple hours sleep, then tackle this thing when we're fresher. Phil, your first priority will be to get the motherboards over to the ERV. Concentrate on getting communications up first. Soon as we've got the juice, we'll send a packet to Micker, tell them Luke's OK, and that... everything else that's happened. The rest of us will take an inventory of supplies, see where we stand. Okay?How do you feel?Look at that. Phil's idea of absolute essentials.It's not a signature.That noise from the Face... It's not a signature. It's a test.It's asking us for the right answer. It wants us to put in the missing pair of chromosomes.To prove that we're human.Which it interpreted as a wrong answer... Yes! It's like a, a security alarm. When it gets an incorrect response, it defends itself.I don't know. But we've got to find out. Can you work this the other way? Figure out which tones would be equivalent to the missing chromosomes? Then dub them into your recording of the signal?What about the radar gun? Will it accept that input? Can we transmit a completed signal back to the Face?Terri, if we leave here without getting some answers, they all died in vain.What are we here for, if not to take chances...?This means we're not alone. It means we're on the brink of the greatest discovery in mankind's history. But we've still got to prove it. Who knows when someone else will get back here? Or if they ever will? You know what Congress is like. They'll say it's too dangerous, too much loss of life, let's go back to unmanned flights. We could be the last explorers to come here for decades. We're it, guys. We're it.How close do we need to get?Check for radiation.Luke, the four-man rover. Does it still work?How long before it hits?How bad?Phil, how much longer to prep the ERV?Then there's still time for us to get out there and back.Stay here. Continue the repair. If something goes wrong, you get out of here before that storm hits.If we're not back in forty-five minutes, I want you to prep and launch. That's 1950 hours.It's not a suggestion, it's an order. You understand?You understand what?Let's go.Phil, do you read me?We're at the Face. We're gonna need a few minutes here. Same deadline, launch at 1950. With or without us. Do you copy?I'm not sure of anything anymore. But I didn't come a hundred million miles just to turn back in the last ten feet.Surface seems firm and level.Don't move! Keep this orientation.Phil? Phil, can you still hear me?I don't think so.No. That was air going into my suit, not out. Look at your own suits -- they're not rigid anymore. We've got pressure in here.We're millions of miles from Earth and we're inside a gigantic white face. What's impossible?Is that what I think it is?They're us. We're them...That's what she means.We are in a ship. This is a ship. And the countdown has already started.I'm not coming with you.That's where I'm going. Don't you see? That's what all this is for. You were right Terri. This is an invitation. To follow them. To follow them home.I have to go. This is the mission now. To find out who we are. Isn't that why we came here? Like Maggie said, \"To stand on a new world and look beyond it to the next one.\"You know, when you think about it -- I wasn't even supposed to be here -- all the accidents, everything that got us to this point, it's just... it's just... I just know it's right.I'm okay. I know what I'm doing. But you're running out of time. You've gotta get back to the ERV and get off this planet. Now please go.My pleasure.He's here, Terri.
