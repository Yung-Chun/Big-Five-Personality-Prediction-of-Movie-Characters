Being afraid of the dark is what keeps most of us alive.That's because they don't know the truth.So, maybe you're thinking I'm an asshole, trying to scare this poor kid for no reason. But that's where you're wrong. Because I've got my reasons. There's a world around you that you've trained yourself not to see. You've willfully closed your eyes. But your fear of the dark is not a weakness. It's there to protect you from things you'd better pray you never see. My eyes were forced open a long time ago. Now I know. Just because you can't see something, doesn't mean it can't kill you.Trust me, I'm carrying enough baggage for the both of us.You really want to know?I'm a paranormal investigator.I'm an effective solution to unusual problems.Speaking of which, that taxi's been following us since the airport.If you can...I'll draw him away...Hello?Linda, what's wrong?I'll figure this out, Linda. I'll find John.Of course not.Sister... John disappeared last night. And something happened to me as well.I need your help, Sister. I need to find the others.I'll let you know as soon as I hear something.I ordered for you, Fischer. It's pecan.That means all nineteen are missing.That's what I'm trying to find out.Thanks Fischer. It's good to know I've still got friends at 713.I missed you too.Aline... let me explain. In private.Five minutes, Aline. I'll tell you everything.I was in the Amazon for six weeks, tracking poachers through their transport lines. Then I fell in with a group of ex- Chilean military selling artifacts on the black-market. This was found in a gold mine in the southern tip of Chile.I asked very nicely.Does it make any sense to you?Ten thousand years ago, it would've been like burying them at the ends of the earth.You're not trying to seduce me, are you?Hairs on the back of my neck just stood up.I could ask you the same thing.I think we'd better run...Can't hold it...Is there any way out of here?Hey Richie.I'll catch up.I need to know what those things are.I'm asking nicely.You're right, Commander. I guess I have gone soft.I need to find out what's happened to John and the others. Stay in contact. We'll meet up later.I'm not here. Commander Burke is. Now what the hell is that thing inside him?The list of people I trust is short, Fischer. Is it about to get shorter?Have you I-D'd him?He was an agent? When?It's fused with his nervous system.Can you remove it?I'm not much for coincidences. These organisms must be connected to those things from the museum.Catchy. When did they first appear?Have you isolated any weaknesses?If they disrupt electricity, why did my flashlight still work?I'm going to need a lot of those.Five minutes...I know.Maybe this will help...What are we looking for?Yeah. That's us right there.John?Behind you!It is. The other two are from the orphanage as well.Something's controlling them.Twenty. Including me.We'd better get out of here.Aline!It's true. I've got one inside me. But it's not controlling me.Why are the lights still out?All Agents! You've got to kill the organism to stop them! Aim for the spine!We need to go down there.They're coming here for a reason. Until we know what they're after, we're never really going to be able to stop them.Every culture has a story about the end of the world.Wait. Aline, look at this...Aline!Subtle.Aline!We'll find a way out.It's just like the organism Fischer took out of Pinkerton.This is where it happened.So it's a key.The answers I've been looking for my whole life could be in there.Barr... how much C-4 you got left?Aline...Give him the key. Enough people have died today.Look at the dust on the floor. This is where Hudgens got in.Over there!We'll find a way.Burke!They were under us the whole time.Something's very wrong...Remember what Hudgens said? I was his last failure. He said he perfected the implant process.Then where the hell is everybody? Where's everybody gone?Here's what I know. There are two worlds on this planet. A world of light and a world of darkness. For millions of years, these worlds were in balance. But now, the lights of human civilization burn everywhere. The dark places are disappearing. We forced them to come out of the shadows. Now, it's my job to force them back in. My name is Edward Carnby.

What museum was it transferred from?It's probably an error. It must be for the big Abkani show.We've got Abkani artifacts coming in from museums around the world. Until Hudgens gets back, I'm doing all the cataloguing anyway.Off on another archeological goosechase. He thinks he's finally found the Erebus.The pictograms are late-period Abkani. It seems to be some sort of... prophecy. Shadows that make ghosts of men. The world of light consumed by darkness. This is the first indication I've ever seen that the Abkani had a myth about the end of the world.Hello?It's a fascinating piece, Dr. Hudgens. I started decoding the pictograms and...I was only going to catalogue it for you.But, Dr. Hudgens, I was just...Edward...I thought you were dead, you asshole!Give me one reason why I'd ever want to speak to you again?It's Abkani...And how did you end up with it?You should've called, Edward. Or written. Just to let me know you were alive.Yesterday, maybe not. But something happened last night.They were found in completely different locations. Alaska. Newfoundland. Venezuela. And now this one's from Chile.The Abkani's written language is based on pictograms. Combinations of symbols to create different meanings. But there's one here I've never seen before.Give me that.What is it?How come every time you show up, my life gets complicated?No! Why didn't you ask me that before you pushed me in here?What do you think?Those doors lead to the front entrance.They saved our lives.It's fine. Thanks.I want to finish studying those artifacts.Commander, I need to get to my office.At least let me pack up my work. There's priceless artifacts in there. If they get damaged...I don't think I want to know your definition of out of the ordinary.Dr. Hudgens. When did you get back?I'm fine. A bit shaken up. But fine.Edward.I can do that myself.Dr. Hudgens... I forgot to ask. Did you find the Erebus this time?Since when do I have a security detail?What's missing...I see nothing's changed...Edward?Sweet dreams...Something smells amazing.I love omelettes.I figured out a connection with the symbols on those artifacts. They correspond to constellations. But something's missing.Can you run the program on this?The Abkani used constellations to pin- point a geographical location. But I don't think I can isolate it closer than a hundred mile radius.That looked like John.You had no choice.How many are there altogether?What are you doing?He's not one of them.What does Hudgens have to do with this?It looks like you're going to war.I've been thinking about something. The Abkani prophecy. The shadows that make ghosts of men...But not every story starts to come true.They're Abkani.It's a warning.The gist of it is, even if you make it down here alive, you're already dead.Maybe this is what they look like when they grow outside a human host?The Abkani didn't put this here.You sure this is going to work?What is this place?Edward, look...The pictograms carved here make it pretty clear that's a bad idea.Some doors are locked for a reason.Edward... if he detonates those charges, we're all dead.Where are all the children?Edward... what's going on?It can't be...Yes Edward?", "clean_line": "scheduled museum transferred probably error big abkani ve got abkani artifacts coming museums world hudgens gets cataloguing archeological goosechase thinks finally erebus pictograms late period abkani sort prophecy shadows ghosts men world light consumed darkness indication ve seen abkani myth end world hello fascinating piece dr hudgens started decoding pictograms going catalogue dr hudgens edward thought dead asshole reason want speak abkani end ve called edward written let know alive yesterday maybe happened night completely different locations alaska newfoundland venezuela chile abkani written language based pictograms combinations symbols create different meanings ve seen come time life gets complicated ask pushed think doors lead entrance saved lives fine thanks want finish studying artifacts commander need office let pack work priceless artifacts damaged think want know definition ordinary dr hudgens fine bit shaken fine edward dr hudgens forgot ask erebus time security missing changed edward sweet dreams smells amazing love omelettes figured connection symbols artifacts correspond constellations missing run program abkani constellations pin point geographical location think isolate closer mile radius looked like john choice altogether hudgens looks like going war ve thinking abkani prophecy shadows ghosts men story starts come true abkani warning gist alive dead maybe look like grow outside human host abkani sure going work place edward look pictograms carved pretty clear bad idea doors locked reason edward detonates charges dead children edward going yes edward"}, "HUDGENS": {"raw_line": "I've been searching for the Erebus for twenty years, Captain. Now that I've found it, I'm afraid your ill-informed superstitions aren't enough to stop me.Bring it up.The conditions must be perfect. Otherwise, there will be... consequences.Did you know the Abkani were the first civilization to use gold for their valuables? They believed it held the power to contain evil spirits. Thousands of years later, we don't even remember why gold was valuable to us in the first place. Now, let's load it onto the truck.You have no idea...I suppose one should not be surprised when mercenaries act mercenary.You're making a terrible mistake.Captain! Don't open it!They're faster than I thought...Did a shipment arrive for me today?Who told you to do that? That crate was not to be opened.It's not your place to question my instructions, Ms. Cedrac. Leave the tablet alone. I'll catalogue it myself when I get back.The Abkani never cease to amaze me.Such a complex society at a time when most of humanity was still hunting and gathering and huddling around fires.A few hours ago. I heard there was some excitement. Are you alright?I apologize for snapping at you earlier. Now, what are you still doing here after all you've been through?Where did you get that image?This is a major find. I'll need to analyze it. Confirm its authenticity.That wasn't a request...Where is the artifact?And you are?My dear, do you have any idea who I...I'll just have to hold off my curiosity until morning.Just an empty shipwreck. You were right. It was another wild goosechase.If you can't beat us, Fischer, join us.I'm afraid I can't allow that.Now drop your weapons and back away.Our early work was crude, I admit. But eventually we perfected the implant process. You were our last failure, Carnby. If you hadn't escaped, 713 never would've shut down the experiments. Burke's eyes flash with anger.Before your kind took over, 713 had very different... priorities. Now, you just blaze in and destroy everything before we can learn to control it. I've wasted twenty years working in secret because of short-sighted men like you. Hudgens sees the Abkani device Aline is holding.There it is... Aline's expression is firm, unafraid. She grips the device tightly. Hudgens is about to pull the trigger.You were a fine archeologist.You couldn't have opened it anyway. Not without this...Insert the key. line inserts the device into the opening in the door.Now turn it.When we found the first of them, 713 saw just another threat to be eliminated.
