You call that lucky?You don't put up with that! Nobody has to put up with that!I tripped over a chair.Why?That's right.Babe, I'm gettin out of here, and that's it. Let's take some time out this weekend, go down to LaJolla, hit the beach, have some fun. Forget all this other stuff, huh?Thanks, Mr. Simms, I'm feeling fine.Well, thank you. And thank them.That's true, Mr. Simms.Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.Whadaya say?What's going on? This is usually coffee break time.Hey, yeah, I'm fine, everything's great. What's this Kaggs? Sounds like a disease.You think he'll chop me?Roy Dillon.That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.Lead on.So I heard.Just myself.Sounds like a good Idea.What? Me?Well, uh... No.I can't take that job! I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating, I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody --But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --Well...Oh, sure.

Give me a chance to get even when I come back.You were right, I had to get out of that hospital. Nothing wrong with me any more.Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.What?Working the what?I'm a salesman.Myra, I'm not following this.You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?Nobody does that single-o.I've heard the name.Is that right?Cole liked to take risks, huh?And when he got serious?I thought these people were broke.And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.Yeah? How?What happened to Cole?Where?Upstate where?That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it?I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.Take a hike, you mean?I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.Sure.I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through?Things a man isn't supposed to know.Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.Long con. I'm the one's been conned. Who needs this?Yeah?What? What for?You -- I don't know.Oh, come here.Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?I pay my debts.Expecting visitors?You ought to put a bandage on that.No.I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.One of my talents.Naughty.Be right out!You were gone for a while.) The track? Did you run into Lilly?She didn't see you, in other words.You must have some very knowledgeable friends.Running your broker scam, you mean.Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out.Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay?Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.I guess I'm just not a leader of men.The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was.Fair enough.And hello to you, too.Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?The last I looked, we were just talking things over.I don't think I need it.Maybe I like it where I am.Don't I get any say in this?That's what I say.What I say is, no. We don't do partners.Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever.No; history. Sooner or later, the lightning hits. I don't want to be around when it hits you.I'm happy the way I am.) What?What's that?You watch that mouth.How do you like this?That's not like me. I don't do violence.That's why we wouldn't work together. You're disgusting. Your mind's so filthy, it's hard even to look at you.Goodbye, Myra.Lilly, I've got a couple things to think about. Well, kind of job offers, kind of. Different ways to go. I'd kind of like to talk them out, you know? Maybe just hear myself talk.Well, that's good news.Well? Who's a boy gonna talk to, if not his mother?Damn.Thanks a lot, Lilly.Yes?Thank you.Well, mostly, I don't believe it.No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.Gun?It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.Not that it matters. This is the morgue?Sure. Let's get it over.Yes, I know, I know.What?Ate the gun. Oh.Well, let's get the shock over with.Not many laughs in this room, eh?Oh, Jesus.No, its -- Why did she--?Oh, yeah. That's that.Mom.Hello, Lilly.Going somewhere?I just came back from Phoenix.Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.You're dead, Lilly, it worked.Why should they? The cops are satisfied.Even so. You still got time. Relax a minute, tell me what happened. Sit down.Myra followed you, huh?No.I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.That's pretty funny, all right. What happened in Phoenix?This way's perfect.You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.You must have some money.And Myra's stuff?Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --I know you do, so that's why --No.I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.You wouldn't do that.Oh, you'll live, Lilly.Oh? I didn't know anything was.Not very good!Uh-huh.Never.What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.For God's sake, Lilly!No.That's right.I don't?I don't see why not.Well, uh...Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.Oh, that's it! You're stealing my money for my own good! How very motherly of you, Lilly.Lilly.If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it?That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...Just trying to help, Lilly.What?What's that all about? Of course you're my mother. Of course you are.There's nothing more to talk about.Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?NO!", "clean_line": "getting better bad shrimp think fine thanks got lot clients oh mr simms uh huh mrs langtry drop medicine baby taking granite isn granite fell wouldn hurt let mm oh baby believe ain bad talking abut myra marriage ow hey trying throw game wait ll year damn guy smack heads heads tails tails bet ace want okay dark dark let borrow better taught lot invented let left home school hand myra lilly away lilly away twisted arm knocked tooth play nice fight sure turn years nice called doctor huh oh yeah thanks long yeah life kind inconvenient lilly thanks uh lilly guess owe life job ll remind best parts doctor says babe mama ll pay lilly worry lilly way oh stupid kid hadn seen seven years day way happened hand care bills lilly talking ve got job boss called said like talk running playback money mob come tough huh sure bluebell came lucky lucky tripped chair right babe gettin let time weekend lajolla hit beach fun forget stuff huh thanks mr simms feeling fine thank thank true mr simms wanted know gotta rush whadaya going usually coffee break time hey yeah fine great kaggs sounds like disease think ll chop roy dillon pretty backhanded compliment let people away things like wouldn good salesman lead heard sounds like good idea uh job mean mean right away recuperating dropped hello everybody need man right wouldn fair oh sure fine perk union station comfortable ll rent car ain seen nothin stretch legs come soon oh ow sorry oh look spilled drinks let buy new round bloody marys watch ll boy guys ve got lot trouble know wouldn chance like fellows drop tell ll roll low number buys ahead roll told buy tell chance come right hospital wrong great away easy week ll work working salesman myra following talk lingo pitch single ve heard right cole liked risks huh got thought people broke month later sucker calls cops run yeah happened cole upstate criminally insane isn bet trying rope hike mean know myra partners needed sure separate rooms expect father come things man isn supposed know sure pretty tired long conned needs yeah know oh come myra come lajolla weekend won hit track beach couple nice restaurants grand hospital pay debts expecting visitors ought bandage guess ll heading east huh nice lilly talents naughty right gone track run lilly words knowledgeable friends running broker scam mean regret coming aboard come myra talk business time yes easier home okay mr kaggs sorry guess leader men truth mr kaggs okay fine perk truth like things way pick hours time uh activities maybe ready oh like stay way fair hello wait minute happen partners looked talking things think need maybe like partners scare shit ve seen people like baby double tough sharp come want work forever history sooner later lightning hits want hits happy way watch mouth like like violence wouldn work disgusting mind filthy hard look goodbye myra lilly ve got couple things think kind job offers kind different ways kind like talk know maybe hear talk good news boy gonna talk mother damn thanks lot lilly yes thank believe mean believe lilly suicide know mother check gun lilly isn suicide mother guess matter worked gamblers knew turn day matters morgue sure let yes know know ate gun oh let shock laughs room eh oh jesus oh yeah mom hello lilly going came phoenix looks solid lilly sit minute tell dead lilly worked cops satisfied got time relax minute tell happened sit myra followed huh wouldn deal blamed pretty funny right happened phoenix way perfect ve start look clean sorry taking money myra stuff far maybe san francisco st louis someplace new start smart lilly good looking won trouble finding job gonna start hope live square job quiet life start showing track hot spots bobo boys lilly listen giving good advice following thought right wanted rackets thought happy know think probably shouldn yeah sure sounds nice wouldn oh ll live lilly oh know good uh huh want pin halo pretty good job god sake lilly right uh matter getting oh stealing money good motherly lilly lilly racket goes double ve got change life completely town square job live like john try way future money wouldn forever rackets bobo justus slap burn holes hands way ve got square route send card settled maybe help trying help lilly course mother course talk lilly jesus"}, "LILLY": {"raw_line": "I'm done here. Do I come back to Baltimore?Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.I know.Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.Roy?Roy? You asleep?My God!Tell the doctor I work for Bobo Justus, and this is an emergency. Don't worry, he knows who Bobo is.What? He's going to be all right!Well, make it stop!You know who I work for.My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.Roy? He's always crying.I like you, too.So what's your story today?Only one arm?Only one tooth?Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.Not quite. But I'm not sure who you are, Mrs... Langtry, was it?Yes. I imagine you're lots of people's friend.Aren't we all?Roy. You're going to be all right.I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks. Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.Second time I gave it to you.Well... You're all right now, I guess. I have to get down to the track.Don't mention it.You always did.Should my ears be burning?I heard those skirts were coming back.Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called. Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --You aren't tough enough.No. And you have to be.You asked me about this. You really want to know what happened?My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be.That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I took a chance, and it didn't work out.I sent Bobo ten grand of my own money, like it was the winnings from my bets. I hoped that would cover me. It didn't.Hi, Bobo.Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much as I should have been, but there was a lot of action on those--I want to keep my teeth.Bobo, no, I --My son --My son was in the hospital --He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.I never fucked up before, Bobo.You do buy it, Bobo. I cost you, and I'm sorry.It'll never happen again. I swear.You're calling the shots.No.You mean, the insurance frammis?You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...Permanent damage.Oh, thanks, Bobo.Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.He's a good kid. A salesman.From you? My folks didn't raise any stupid kids.Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.Well, you can tell them I said they're right. I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.I will. So long, Bobo.Lucky! Lucky! Oh, am I lucky.! Am I lucky!He let me live. He let me be his friend.You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy?Get off the grift, Roy.You don't have the stomach for it.I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.Go away.Could I have some coffee, please?Your pal wants you.Yes.Oh! Are you all right?I shouldn't have hit him that hard. I guess I don't know my own strength.I thought I did. You should take better care of your friend.I'm sorry a lady can't eat in here without being bothered.That sounds nice. Pecan pie. Thank you.Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?If you come out to the track, don't know me.What's that?Roy, I don't want money from you.You do?No. That was the point.No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air.Roy, take that back.I thought... I was hoping we could play it straight with one another.After the meet. Back to Baltimore.You, too, Roy.Prick.Yes?Roy! An unexpected pleasure.Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down. It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know.Roy?Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.Do you have something around back, facing away from the road?Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?Fine.And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call.Oh! Roy! You scared me.Somewhere else, that's for sure.Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?I've really got to --Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.Just for a minute.She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?As though you do what I say.Roy, it was terrible. You read about people killing people and all that, but when it happens, my God.She was in her nightgown, you know, the old grifter's dodge, nightgown and the Ice bucket and she just got into the wrong room by mistake.I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.Just a few bucks.Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?At what?A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.What?Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.You want a drink?No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?I'll get it.Take whichever one you want.You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live.I know what's bugging you, of course.Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.No, I guess not. It was pretty lousy of me, I guess, to be a child at the same time you were. Not to stop being a child just because I had a child. I guess I was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up.And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.You're getting off the grift?That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?Well, I guess I got it wrong, then. Seems to me I heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him.Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.A future. The only future I've got.) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?You'd like that, wouldn't you? Sure you would. You don't need to tell me. Now, why would you like it, Roy?Roy... RoyI have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?No? Won't you give me the money, Roy? Can't I change your mind? What can I do to change your mind?Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --", "clean_line": "come baltimore delmar california thousand miles know maybe ll swing los ang gleez way roy roy asleep god tell doctor work bobo justus emergency worry knows bobo going right stop know work son right isn ll killed roy crying like story today arm tooth come kid let food house sure mrs langtry yes imagine lots people friend aren roy going right working san diego weeks thought drop long lost son second time gave right guess track mention ears burning heard skirts coming little accident went place picked mall bills ll care manager says boss called pulled wool everybody eyes huh stop kidding years town like los ang gleez peanut selling job best expect believe dump live clown pictures walls roy dillon cornball clown pictures commission salesman isn grift know working angle tell wrote book cut rackets roy aren tough asked want know happened boss guy named bobo justus baltimore long shot gets action money horse track way odds day delmar meet nag called bluebell day came stuck gonna choice took chance work sent bobo grand money like winnings bets hoped cover hi bobo guess guy work getting away bobo horse bobo lot action want teeth bobo son son hospital left home long time ago hospital los ang gleez real sick fucked bobo buy bobo cost sorry ll happen swear calling shots mean insurance frammis hit person oranges towel big awful looking bruises hurt right working scams insurance companies louse insides puh puh puh permanent damage oh thanks bobo gee better okay gotta drive los ang gleez good kid salesman folks raise stupid kids oh know clip buck buck notice person look dumb look anybody liability right bobo working angle steal little steeling big know like suit bobo know makes look taller tell said right better going roy ll wonder long bobo lucky lucky oh lucky lucky let live let friend want punch stomach roy grift roy stomach life away coffee pal wants yes oh right shouldn hit hard guess know strength thought better care friend sorry lady eat bothered sounds nice pecan pie thank roy san diego come track know roy want money point dip bag ll heal air roy thought hoping play straight meet baltimore roy prick yes roy unexpected pleasure sure roy want drive okay fine come won home cooked meal know roy good evening like single tonight light sleeper traffic noise keeps wide awake night facing away road sounds perfect park car fine ll want leave early wake oh roy scared sure oh yeah frame holding ve got long fingerprint check bobo won ll spend money sure minute blew bobo guess running tell stash wouldn hit roy terrible read people killing people happens god nightgown know old grifter dodge nightgown ice bucket got wrong room mistake sat thought run ve got bobo law stay explain isn maybe break ve wanting racket years clean start sorry hated money need roy run money run dead bucks credit cards far gonna job ve legit job life roy know big world roy fine time bobo bobo isn bobo goddamn good survivor roy survive survive way need money bobo knows stash car dare touch lilly dillon dead leaves want drink goddamn thirsty ice water ll whichever want know roy idea live know bugging course oh ve got legitimate complaint roy deny wasn good mother kid bad mother standards ve thought know know bad wonder think guess pretty lousy guess child time stop child child guess real stinker grown needed grown making feel bad time huh way know way ve picking poor little roy gave life twice asking need money getting grift good belong fence know stayed crook think live ripe age guess got wrong heard guy age got hit hard guts killed sure sure count different ve got rid money ll think clever ll temptation game future future ve got isn turn charge power roy told wasn mother weren related like wouldn sure need tell like roy roy royi money roy won money roy change mind change mind roy"}}}
