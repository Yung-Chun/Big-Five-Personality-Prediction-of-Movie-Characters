{"Lock-Stock-and-Two-Smoking-Barrels": {"EDDY": {"raw_line": "Three card brag is a simple form of poker; you are dealt only three cards and these you can't change. If you don't look at your cards you're a `blind man' and you only put in half the stake. Three of any kind is the highest you can get: the odds are four hundred and twenty- five to one. Then it's a running flush - you know, all the same suit running in order; then a straight, then a flush, then a pair, and finally whatever the highest card you are holding. There are some tell- tale signs that are valuable; I am not going to tell you them because it took me long enough to learn them, but these can only help a player, not make one. So you want to play?I haven't slept for forty-eight hours, got a dozen broken ribs, can feel a case of the flu coming on and . . .If you think you're in the dark, I am in a black hole, blindfolded.Bargain, that's a bloody bargain if I ever heard one. Ten pounds you say? I'll have five.Bacon!The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big boy now and it is time to move on.Nick the Greek, always a pleasure. All right Tom, what you been eating?Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.A hundred grand.The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.I still will, if you don't mind.Because it's cheap like a budgie.He means they're thieving dogs.I am going to the john.Why, what's up?Don't be silly Dad, I wouldn't have anything to do with that.Invitations?Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .Evening Frazer, Phil, Don. This is a bit dramatic, isn't it? Is it supposed to be symbolic?I would have brought my gloves if I had known.Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.The type of shirt that has buttons on the front and collars at the top, Frazer. One hundred and fifty blind.No Frazer, it's just I'm the only classy fella you have had the pleasure of seeing in London. One hundred and seventy-five blind.When my knees stop knocking I'll live with it. Four hundred blind.One thousand blind.Two thousand blind.Donald, do you know how to play this game? The reason I put in half the anti is because I don't know what I have got. Now play, or fold.Ten grand blind.Twenty thousand open.Twenty thousand open.Fifty grand.One hundred grand.That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.You will what?I think I would rather just turn them over.I need two hundred and fifty grand.That's if I want to see you.I'll see ya.Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.I knew he was bluffing, but somehow the worst card player round the table had fucked me like a frozen virgin with a pair of sevens. A series of blows to my head with a baseball bat would have been greeted with a grin compared to this. Ten minutes earlier, I was two hundred thousand pounds richer; now I owed half a million.I then explained the unfortunate position we were in. Harry was going to start sizing up all our fingers in a week, 'cause he knew there was no way I could raise that kind of money on my own. Harry saw it as their money on the table so it was also their debt off the table. I hate to admit it but I could have kissed the old bastard for that. If I said I wanted to settle this debt on my own it would have been a lie.Listen, I wish he would let me settle it on my own.I'll think of something, don't worry.Hit the fuckers.They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?All right, but for Christ's sake we're in the soup and this is the silver spoon. If you can think of another way to get out, let me know. It's not like we've got all the time in the world either . . . Dig?Well, we hit them as soon as they come back. We'll be waiting and prepared for them.Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and...And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.No, just one of them is in charge of them going to the job. So I assume he will stillYes?Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?Everything all right out there, Tom?Where the hell are we supposed to hide?Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate.Tie 'em up, tape 'em up, face and mouth. Keys, I want the keys.I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.Bacon, see what we got.I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.That's it all done, we are off.There is nowhere else to keep it, and it's the last place they are going to look. Anyway the battle's over and the war is won.Well, not a bad day's work. That takes care of Harry.I don't want that horrible shit. Give it to Soap. Can we just lock up and get drunk now, please?That inspires confidence, that does.Jesus, would you two stop flirting for one minute . . . After we pay Hatchet, this deal puts us up near enough two hundred grand each. Not bad for a day's work, I think you will agree.Bollocks! You can think about it for as long as you like. I am panicking and I am off mate.It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him.He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone.It's Ed, if that's what you mean.I wanted to talk to you about that.Well what?He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now.Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we should go and see him.You and me, Tom.Tom, this is our case.This is our money, Tom! . . . Now I think we should go.Tom, don't mess around, let's go.Tom?I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.If you think you're in the dark, I am in a black hole, blindfolded.The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.And Tom took care of them.The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside?Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.The silly sod.Thank you.There's nothing in it!I mean it's fucking empty.", "clean_line": "card brag simple form poker dealt cards change look cards blind man half stake kind highest odds running flush know suit running order straight flush pair finally highest card holding tell tale signs valuable going tell took long learn help player want play haven slept hours got dozen broken ribs feel case flu coming think dark black hole blindfolded bargain bloody bargain heard pounds ll bacon reason called bacon spent youth police station people thought big boy time nick greek pleasure right tom eating sure afford bacon fat man time harry grand man decides play man harry hatchet harry including like hatchet colleague monster man barry baptist mind cheap like budgie means thieving dogs going john silly dad wouldn invitations got thousand pretty pieces paper queen samoan jo yon mean pub hold evening frazer phil bit dramatic isn supposed symbolic brought gloves known yup harry sorry know father type shirt buttons collars frazer blind frazer classy fella pleasure seeing london seventy blind knees stop knocking ll live blind thousand blind thousand blind donald know play game reason half anti know got play fold grand blind thousand open thousand open grand grand raise think turn need grand want ll ya going accept quid knew bluffing worst card player round table fucked like frozen virgin pair sevens series blows head baseball bat greeted grin compared minutes earlier thousand pounds richer owed half million explained unfortunate position harry going start sizing fingers week cause knew way raise kind money harry saw money table debt table hate admit kissed old bastard said wanted settle debt lie listen wish let settle ll think worry hit fuckers report drugs money nicked right christ sake soup silver spoon think way let know like ve got time world dig hit soon come ll waiting prepared er bad breath colourful language feather duster think armed guns tit jesus soap stop mincer thought going carrying charge going job assume stillyes list priorities nice look outfits haven got like tom right tom hell supposed hide british empire built cups tea think going war mistaken mate tie em tape em face mouth keys want keys ll meet van finished handsome bacon got dunno think need dump lights place going look battle war won bad day work takes care harry want horrible shit soap lock drunk inspires confidence jesus stop flirting minute pay hatchet deal puts near grand bad day work think agree bollocks think long like panicking mate old boy place lose digit daily going ll care right going money cares different pass phone ed mean wanted talk said thinks paid wants talk guns listen guns money think tom tom case money tom think tom mess let tom know know harry means debt debt problem problem neighbours dead think right haven wrong means clear think dark black hole blindfolded traffic warden went morgue recognized dog lot sort clear got case evidence tom took care item connects crime sitting car sitting outside tom throw guns bridge silly sod thank mean fucking"}, "TOM": {"raw_line": "What are you talking about?

He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.Who's this fat man, then?You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.But he needs him, because he is good at making sure debts get settled and jobs get done.So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.Fat? Who are you calling fat? What are all these fat jokes about?What do you mean?What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get your rest in.Listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays; it's in all our interests.What the hell are you doing here?Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet Harry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy!I heard this place was rough.I'll kill him!Listen to this one then; you open a company called the Arse Tickler's Faggot Fan Club. You take an advert in the back page of some gay mag, advertising the latest in arse-intruding dildos, sell it a bit with, er . . . I dunno, `does what no other dildo can do until now', latest and greatest in sexual technology. Guaranteed results or money back, all that bollocks. These dills cost twenty-five each; a snip for all the pleasure they are going to give the recipients. They send a cheque to the company name, nothing offensive, er, Bobbie's Bits or something, for twenty-five. You put these in the bank for two weeks and let them clear. Now this is the clever bit. Then you send back the cheques for twenty-five pounds from the real company name, Arse Tickler's Faggot Fan Club, saying sorry, we couldn't get the supply from America, they have sold out. Now you see how many of the people cash those cheques; not a single soul, because who wants his bank manager to know he tickles arses when he is not paying in cheques!Probably no longer than four weeks.Well, it's still a good idea.I have heard some fucking stupid ideas in my time but yours makes Bacon's sound inspired.What's the flapping about? You told the old man yet? EDDYHow heavy are the fellas anyway?It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!Not normal weed. This is some fucked-up skunk class A. I can't think let alone move shit.Neither me, but it depends on what flicks your switch, and the light's on and burning bright for the masses.Listen, it's all completely chicken soup.Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.I think you're Nick the Greek.Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?What's that, a pound for every year they have been around? I know they're antiques, but I ain't paying antique prices. Pause.Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either.

I rather like ' em.Is there something we should know about you, Soap?Well, not exactly like that.Right as rain.They're here.Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?A what?Shit Ed, we've got a traffic warden.Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.Rory Breaker?This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?You would take a pain ? the arse full stop.There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?How many wings have they got between them?How many feet?That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy?]That's fucked it. What do we do now?
