{"Austin-Powers-International-Man-of-Mystery": {"DR. EVIL": {"raw_line": "Gentlemen, are we all here? Good. As you know, my plot to high-jack nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage has failed. Again. This organization will not tolerate failure.Mustafa...Frau Farbissina...I spared your lives because I need you to help me rid the world of the only man who can stop me now. We must go to London. I've set a trap for Austin Powers!Not this time. Come, Mr. Bigglesworth! See you in the future, Mr. Powers!I'll be back, Mr. Powers, when free love is dead, and greed and avarice once again rule the world.Ladies and Gentlemen, it's been a long time, but I'm back. It's all gone perfectly to plan except for one small flaw. Because of a technical error, my right arm was not frozen. I was therefore by definition only partially frozen.Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!Silence!Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.Gentlemen, let's get down to business.We've got a lot of work to do.Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.Right. Okay. Moving on.Let me go around the table and introduce everyone. Frau Farbissina......founder of the militant wing of the Salvation Army. Random Task......a Korean ex-wrestler, evil handyman extraordinaire. Show them what you do.Thank you, Random Task. Patty O'Brien......ex-Irish assassin. His trademark?A superstitious man, he leaves a tiny keepsake on every victim he kills. Scotland Yard would love to get their hands on that piece of evidence.Finally, I come to my number two man. His name: Number Two.For thirty years, Number Two has run Virtucon, the legitimate face of my evil empire.Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here. OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a \"laser.\" Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer aroundRight. Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage. Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom... ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!All right then... ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!Oh, really? One-hundred billion dollars. OK, make it happen. Anything else?Yes.My son?Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil. I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son! Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.Quite impressive.I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character...Forget it.Gentlemen, Phase One is complete. The warhead is ours. Let Phase Two begin! Patch us through to the United Nations security secret meeting room.Gentlemen, my name is Dr. Evil.In a little while, you'll find out that the Kreplachistani warhead has gone missing. Well, it's in safe hands. If you want it back, you'll have to pay me...ONE MILLION DOLLARS!Sorry. ONE-HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS!Doctor Evil! I didn't spend six years in evil medical school to be called 'mister'.Fine, have it your way. Gentlemen, you have five days to come up with oneReally? So long.Gentlemen, in exactly five days from now, we will be one-hundred billion dollars richer. Ha-ha-ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha-ha.Okay...Well...I think I'm going to watch some TV.Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?An evil vet?An evil petting zoo?No, the boy's right. I really am evil.Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.The details of my life are quite inconsequential.Very well, where should I begin? My father was a relentlessly self- improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen-year-old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink, he would make outrageous claims, like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. A sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical.Frau Farbissina, check on our guests.Welcome to my underground lair, Mr. Powers. Mrs. Kensington's daughter, how lovely. I believe your name is Vanessa? I'd shake your hands, except for obvious reasons.My hand, dammit! Look at it!Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak!Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr. Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.Gentlemen, I give you the Vulcan.The world's most powerful subterranean drill.So powerful it can penetrate the Earth's crust, delivering a 50 kiloton nuclear warhead into the planet's hot liquid core. Upon detonation, every volcano on the planet will erupt.Gentlemen, your deadline is in three hours. You have your instructions.Come join us for dinner, won't you Mr. Powers?I think you'll enjoy the food. I have the best chef in the world. His name is Ezekial. He's made of seventy-five percent plastic.Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?And that's how you want to live your life, is it?Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.In due time.I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.Mr. Powers, Vanessa, some friends of mine are joining us for dinner.No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma. All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.Release the sharks! All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.Right. Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.What is it now?I have one simple request&emdash sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people?Right.Really? Are they ill-tempered?Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill- tempered sea bass it is. Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.No Scott. You just don't get it, do you?Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?What did you say?Arm the probe!Probe in place.Five minutes to go. Let the penetration countdown begin.Activate the blast shutters!Launch the subterranean probe!Come, Mr. Bigglesworth!Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for&emdash swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered toYour freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.Well, it seems the tables have turned, Mr. Powers.Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.Scott, don't say that...I'll get you yet, Austin Powers!No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die.", "clean_line": "gentlemen good know plot high jack nuclear weapons hold world hostage

I'm in a nutshell! What kind of nut has such a big nutshell? How did I get into this bloody great big nutshell?You're smashed, Vanessa.Oh, yes you are.I can't. You're drunk.She was very groovy.

What exactly do you do at Virtucon?I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'Hello, Exposition.Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.Excuse me?Carnies.Circus folk. Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle. I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.That's not your mother, that's a man!I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick.Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.Yes, Basil?Thanks.Of course, luv.Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.Only sailors use condoms, man.Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port. Alotta meant nothing to me.It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.Hello, luv.Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.Out and about, doing odds and sods.Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?Who?No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.I'll take him, you take her.Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.Sure.Everything seems to be in order.Hold on one second.Here, have a piece of gum.Don't mind if I do.No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert.Judo chop! Judo chop!Our only way out of here is to drive out!Hang on! I'm going to floor it!Where did you learn to shoot?Where? Where?Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.What's wrong with your hand?I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.Does that make you horny?Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.Smashing idea! Give it to me.Judo chop!Hold on, Vanessa!Not a good time to lose one's head.That's not the way to get ahead in life.It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.Fair enough.We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag. You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her&emdash I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!&emdashAnyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because...I love you.Hello, hello.No, actually, I have to save the world.Is it cold in here?I've got to get Dr. Evil! Margaret Thatcher naked on a cold day! Margaret Thatcher naked on a cold day! Margaret Thatcher naked on a cold day!Au contraire, I think you can't resist me.It's not what it looks like, Vanessa. At ease, boys.I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they...and I...Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!Don't worry!Blast! Out of ammo.I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?Why not? It's a question.Where's the abort button?Ow! That really hurt. I'm going to have a lump there, you idiot! Who throws a shoe? You fight like a woman.Care for a drink?Shocking.Nooooooo!I've got you, Dr. Evil!No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same. It's freedom, man.That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.Man, you are one chilly square!Let's split!Lay it on me.That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.Behave!Just when things were getting interesting.I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!Thanks, Basil.

This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.I'm afraid not. Earlier this week, Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's planning a trap for you tonight at the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus here in swinging London.Good luck, Austin.Oh, and Austin&emdashBe careful.As you know, gentlemen, Dr. Evil had himself frozen in 1967. Soon after, Austin Powers volunteered to have himself frozen, in the event Dr. Evil should ever return. We believe Dr. Evil has begun yet another plot to take over the world. And that, gentlemen, is why we're here.No, he worked freelance, an internationally renowned swinging photographer by day and the ultimate gentlemen spy by night.You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.We won, Austin.It's Dr. Evil.Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms. Kensington is her daughter.Vanessa's one of our top agents.Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated. She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.Oh, and Austin&emdashBe careful.Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.Oh, and Austin&emdashBe careful.Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.Where is Vanessa, by the way?Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.Oh, and Austin&emdashLet me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.There's one more thing, Austin.Be careful.Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high-jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.What's the other?What's the other thing you're scared of?What?Indeed...If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.Austin did some reconnaissance work at Alotta Fagina's penthouse last night.Top drawer, Kensington. Oh, Austin, I want you to meet somebody.Austin, this is my mother, Mrs. Exposition. She's in from Tunbridge WellsMy God, Austin, what have you done?Get away from my mother!Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!All right, Austin, I think you should go.I'm leaving! Oh, and Austin?Be careful.My God, man, don't you understand? It won't just be active volcanoes, inactive ones will erupt as well. Seven-eighths of the Earth's land mass will be deluged with hot magma. Tectonic plates will shift, causing massive earthquakes. Imagine no United Kingdom. Think of it, no cricket, no tea, no freshly toasted crumpets smothered with Devonshire clotted cream, the diving mystery of Stonehenge. Imagine severing forever the continuity of Britannic majesty, the demise of this sceptered isle, this jewel, this England...I'm afraid we've lost contact with him.Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.Because of your exemplary service to Her Majesty, you are now officially an active Field Agent with all the privileges and responsibilities thereof.Austin, I have something for you as well.Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.Austin, now, about your next mission&emdash Still kissing Vanessa, Austin motions with his thumbs to the pilot of the helicopter to lift Basil up. He rises away in mid- sentence.But, wait, I&emdash you got me again.

You know, a lot's changed since 1967.My mother's told me all about you.My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.Let's gather your personal effects, shall we?Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...I beg your pardon?Excuse me?I'm sorry?Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.A Chigro?We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.Sure.What?I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever. If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.You're going to sleep on the sofa. I'd like to remind you, Mr. Powers, that the only reason we're sharing a room is to support our cover story that we're a married couple on vacation.Let's unpack.I'm sure.Here, use mine.What's wrong?Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.Number Two? That's an unusual name.Why did you leave so soon?Hello Mum?Great.He's asleep.Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.Why?Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.What about his teeth?I just don't see it.Did you ever...Did you ever want to?You didn't answer my question, Mum.Do you want to talk to him?I'm on with a friend! Look, I'd better go. I love you.Why?A limousine has just pulled up.How do you know?Let's go get him!We can't just sit here, Austin.I don't get it.Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.I hate having my picture taken.I couldn't have another bite.Watch out, you're on my hair!Go! Just go!I haven't had fun like that since college.Why?Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.I am not.I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about. What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.When did you find that out, Austin?Oh.Yes, Virtucon runs a tour of their facilities every hour. I suggest we pose as tourists and do site-level reconnaissance.Austin, have you gone mad?Really, Austin!Austin, may I have a word with you?Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspiciousI can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?No, did you use a condom?Not in the Nineties.Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.Do you think she's prettier than I?You know who.I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.That's amazing. Let's go!Austin, we have to go!Where did you learn to drive?Austin, watch out!Thank God, Austin, we made it.I don't understand.Not now, Austin.What's your plan?Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.Austin, watch out!Indeed.Yes.Shut up.What do we do now?I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.I'll hurry back.Austin, what's your point?Oh, behave!Likewise.I believe you, Austin. Let's go.Are you crazy?Austin, I'm coming with you.I'll secure the perimeter.This is for sleeping with my man, you whore!I don't believe you.OK, I believe you. But you still must be chopped.Judo chop!I have something to tell you.I love you, Austin.Kiss me.Thank you, Exposition.
