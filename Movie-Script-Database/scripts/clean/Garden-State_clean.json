The cop car stops behind him and blares him with the search light.What?I didn't...Kenny?Great!I know.Yeah... yup.Why, Kenny?Yeah but, I mean... Kenny, the last time I saw you, you were blowing coke lines off the top of a urinal.What do you mean?You mean like... as a... cop?I don't know.

Shouldn't you like help starving kids or something?Oh no thanks, man.No, no thanks.I guess I'll see youguyslater. He eats the hit. They laugh.Oh, who's up? They all laugh. She gets up and slowly walks over to the couch. She smiles nervously. Large stares at her. we see in his eyes he's feeling more fucked up every instant. She stands above him at the couch, then straddles him with her knees on either side of his legs; sitting on his lap. The MUSIC PLAYS. Everyone is speechless. she slowly leans in. Eye contact. They kiss softly enjoying every second. Its incredibly sexy.So, Tim, how long you been working at medieval Times?Congratulations.What was it that happened to you in high school? You had a thing, but I forgot what it was.I remember that. That was sofucked up. Why did he do that?That's right.What?Like the Star. Trek guys?Yeah let's hear it, man?what are the tapes?So... what, you like sell property?Yeah. Good to see you too. She gets to the door, then crosses back to Mark.Oh not What time is it ?Hi, I'm Andrew bargeman. I'm sorry. i'mn a little late for my appointment. She looks at her watch.Okay, thanks. Sorry.Hi, how are you? The dog looks both ways before mounting Large's leg and proceeds to thrust his groin to and fro. Large tries to shove him off. He looks back at the blind woman who stares off in the other direction. Large is about to say something to her but he stops himself.Get off. Off. The dog thrusts away.Got any suggestions?I don't want to hurt him.Yeah, but I don't want to like destroy future generations of charitable dogs. Besides he's got to be close to finishing by now.I feel so used.Thanks for your help. Or at least your good intentions.Oh, did you go to Columbia High?Yeah.No.I got to fill this thing out, but thank you for... that.Thank you.Well thanks. Thank you.No. Not right now I'm just...No, I'm just auditioning and.,.What are you listening to?No.That's cool. I like it.What are you doing here?I'm uh... there's a_..Its al=ight. I... I uh get headaches. So I just wanna have that checked out.Yes.Okay. He stands. He turns to Sam.Andrew.Thanks.Yes - hi.What?Yeah. They shape hands.I've been having these really intense headaches. They only last for a split second and then they're gone. It's like a lightning flash; almost like a surge of electricity and then it's gone. He looks at the chart.Yeah.Yeah. Thank you.Yeah.Well I think I've had them in some form since I was a little kid. But they've been getting more and more frequent over the last year.Oh uh, I've been on some form of it since I was ten or so.No. I mean I don't know. It's recently occurred to me that I might not even have a problem. only I'd never know it, because as far back as I can remember I've been medicated. I grew up on it. I left them in LA. This is the first time I haven't had it in my body since I can remember.Actually I. was thinking about taking a little vacation.E)h well, my psychiatrist is my Dad. So uh... he... I think he'd prefer me to stay on it. He likes to think it makes me happy. And I let him think that because he's sort of consumed by the idea of making everyone happy.But that doesn't really feel like it. I mean I don't feel stressed or really anxious at all.Oh, right.Why were you really there?Do you lie a lot?Enough for people to call you a liar.Is one of them \"liar\"?Because I`ll choose to trust YOU.I can try.It was my grandfather's. It was the only thing he left to anyone in my family and he left it to me. And I like it.It is?Would you like a ride home?Why not?What are you like... a hanglider? They drive off.So what, it's like one of those tandem things?But what kind of helmet is that?I should live through the day.Are you doing anything right now?Well, I just had this idea. I promised this guy I'd stop by his house that's right up here, but I don't really wanna stay very long. So I was just thinking if you came with me I could say I have to take you home when I'm ready to go.I know.No, it's not like that, c'mon. It'll be fun. I promise.If you'd like.Liar. The light changes and they drive off.I'll be fine. Am I the first boy you've ever brought home?He doesn't drive a bike?Well we're off to a great start.So how am I supposed to know what's real?Open the door.No.No, he's a really nice guy.Yes.It's nice.I'm not. It's really nice. It's very cozy. You guys are a little early on the tree, huh?No, not at all. I like it.Yeah, sure. They cross to the staircase and are met by TITEMBAY a handsome, young Black Man in a sweater carrying books.Hi, nice to meet you.Yeah, you too. They walk up the stairs.Uhh... It's Titembay right?Stop doing that.That whole thing you just did. Don't do that. I want to be here, and I wouldn't be here if I didn't want to be, okay? Trust me, my family's way more fucked up then yours, okay?So, Titembay.Is he adopted?Wow.Wow. I mean that's great. It's a crazy story.What is Tickle?And Tickle is all that remains?Was there a hurricane or something?It's like the Wailing Wall.The Wailing Wall. It's like the most holy place for Jews to go and pray in Israel. It's all that's left of this enormous temple that was destroyed by the Romans.No I'm not. I mean I'm Jewish, but I'm not really Jewish. I don't do anything Jewish. I don't go to temple or anything. But I don't know any Jews who go to temple. The Jews I know only go on Yom Kippur. One day; the day of repentance. Did you know that most temples are designed with movable walls so that on the one day of the year when \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 everyone comes to repent they can actually make the room big enough to hold everyone?Just tickle.What?No, I wasn't...Okay. I hadn't planned on...So no one has ever done that?No.No. Trust me yours was good enough for both of us.ZzzZzz. Be stares at her.How was that?Wow.I mean this is...Now?Right now?Uh... Right now I was thinking... I was thinking that I've been going to a lot of these things lately.No, not dates. This isn't a date. Is this a date? Funerals.God, it's weird to say that out loud: 'My Mom died\". And uh... eo that's why I'm home... now.No, it's okay. It's okay actually. I'm all right with it. Anyway I think it's what she wanted so..,No, its okay. She uh... she drowned actually. Sam's jaw drops.My Mom was a paraplegic; she had uh... she was in a wheelchair. She was uh... taking a bath and then I guess she slipped or something. That's what they say. I don't know. But needless to say, she drowned. And so... that's how she died. Sam is speechless. Tears well in her eyes.This was uh... Hmm... Sunday.Why are you crying?Look, let's change the subject, okay? Let's really bring the focus back to Jelly. I mean what could be ruder than talking about someone else who died while you're in the act of burying a close friend. Sam places the box in the hole she's dug.Well IIve only been to one of these things, you appear to be the expert.okay, well I'll go first. I didn't really know you, Jelly. But from what I hear, you were a good pet. Had a little trouble with the wheel...I was just thinking-Miss me?No.some trophy. I do have to say I'm impressed with the turnout.Seems to me the only thing more depressing than a funeral is a funeral where no one shows up. Don't you ever think about who'll show up to yours?It's one way to determine who your friends are. The people who'd show up at my funeral if it was held in their state, that's one level of friend. But my real friends, the people who really love me, they'd come if it was on the other side of the country.You'd be there.I do. I think you'd show up because the truth is, that you really did miss met you always thought of me as the brother you never had. But you've got too much pride to let me know that. You want to pout 'cause I don't return your calls.Today I've been more talkative than I remember.Funeral? Honestly? I probably wouldn't travel for it- no. But don't worry, I'm sure you'll have a great turnout.'Cause there's also the guy who lives his life to insure a good turnout. I think that's how my Dad lives his-, like he's sort of writing his own eulogy as he goes and making life choices dependent on how it will sound in a speech.I'm just saying a lot of people - not necessarily you - a lot of people try and accumulate accolades that will somehow justify their lives.Where do I sign up for not caring?Wow, that was so clever how you did that. Is he grooming you to be a psychiatrist too? Med school's one thing, but please don't become him.well you would say that; you're the son and daughter he never had. Hell, you're the family he never had. Has he got you on Lithium yet? Wait till he does, you'll love him even more. He stands.i looked for a message; I got bored and became an actor. He leaves.Hello?Holy shit, you scared the shit out of me. He covertly slips the perfume bottle into his pocket.Yeah.Yeah... fine.Yeah. Silence. The FAUCET DRIPS. They avoid eye contact.Yeah... good.Yeah. Silence. DRIP. DRIPLook, I wanted to ask you... I mean if you don't want to talk about this its perfectly fine, but I'm just...But we don't have to do it now. I mean you don't have to do that now. It's just at some point I would... I have some questions.So she didn't yell or...It's just weird.I don't know, it's just that you'd think if someone was really drowning to death they would scream. I mean really scream from the terror of it all, you know? They would splash and scream I would think; I would have thought.Don't take this the wrong way.I'm not reading into this, I'm just thinking out loud so don't getWhat?I'm just saying did they check? I mean has someone ruled that out?I'm just saying the facts.And I suppose it doesn't even really matter. But I'd be curious to know. I would like to know if that's what happened; just for me. I mean would that surprise you?She made it very clear to everyone she knew that nothing was ever going to make her happy-And c'mon let's be honest; she tried it before.I think I deserve to know the truth.I don't know. Jesse continues talking, but his voice distorts into WARBLEDAbsolutely.C'mon let me see it.Don't be shy. Just let me see it.You're the alligator?That was so good. You're Mom's right you were amazing. Titembay has begun brushing white powder on Large's water glass revealing his fingerprints.Bye. Thank you so much for dinner.I'll take a hug. They embrace.Good-Night.It was the only thing I ever really liked doing; pretending to be someone else.It's not funny.So what should we laugh at you about?Which part are we laughing about?Preventative covering?I haven't cried since I was a little kid. I didn't cry at my mother's funeral. I wanted to-Oh, no. Mark, Dave and Jesse appear with some others.'Course I can swim. JUMP CUT TO. Large in the shallow-end doing the most pathetic doggy paddle you've ever seen. Everyone stares in disbelief.I never learned how to swim.There's a handful of normal kid things I kinda missed.Probably till my fingers get wrinkly.Oh. I think I'll probably head home the day after tomorrow. well, LA. That's not my home. Rer smile fades.You know that point in your life when you realize that the home you grew up in isn't really your home anymore? And all of a sudden, even though you have a place where you put your Shit, the idea of \"home', is gone.You'll gee when you move out. It just kind of happens one day and it's gone. And you feel like you can never get it back. it's like you feel homesick for a place that doesn't even exist. But maybe it's like this rite of passage, you know? And you won't ever have that feeling again until you create a A new idea of \"home\" for yourself, for the family you start, for your kids. It's like this cycle.I feel like if I had showed up at school and presented the idea of silent Velcro they would have sent me away a whole lot sooner. They all laugh.They didn't send me away.I mean they did, but... they sent me to boarding school. \"Sent me away\" implies I went to some asylum or something. There were no straps involved.They sent me to boarding school because uh... they thought I might be dangerous.I was a kid and I was - they just... I was a teenager and they were depressed and it just wasn't a good combo.I know. You and Titembay should go into business together; solve mysteries out of a van.No. No. I just... it's fine.. I just haven't ever really talked about it.You wanna know?Really, really?No. Drumroll... I was the reason she was in a wheelchair.No, it's the truth.It was a complete freak accident. I mean its one of those things that you replay a million times in your head and you see so clearly what a freak thing it was. I... Say whole life she was depressed for no reason. Look at this picture. He pulls the picture of he and Cynthia as children wearing chicken slippers out of his wallet.Look at her face.. That's how, she. was every single day of her life. And one day... I was nine years old and I just really hated, her for that, and I pushed her.Yeah. Fuck yeah. And any other time, she would have just yelled at me and sent me to my room, but this time, in that moment, the door of the dishwasher was open. The latch on it was broken and it would just randomly fall open. That fucking latch; it's funny how so much of my life hasbeendetermined by a quarterinchpiece of plastic. So she fellbackover the door and her neck hitthekitchen counter; paralyzing her from the waist down. Sam's eyes are wide in shock.Still want to compare fucked up families?Well I was nine. They sent me to therapy and my Father put me on these drugs that were supposed to \"curb my anger\". And I've been on some form of them ever since. My Mother who was clinically depressed before the accident, sank even lower to the point where she just ignored everyone but our housekeeper, Janice and her daughter, Cynthia. And when I was sixteen my psychiatrist Dad came around to the conclusion that it might not be the healthiest environment for me to be growing up in. So he sent me to boarding school. And I haven't been home since.Until now for her funeral. I'm off to a ripping start in this life, huh? Next time through I think I'll lay low out of the gate. He takes a sip of his beer.I think it was. So I left them in LA. I'm taking myself off punishment.What?what do you mean?I think you're right. I'm \"in it\". But I'm so glad I'm \"in it\" 'cause I'm working it all out, you know? I haven't swallowed a pill in four days now and I can already feel this eerie clarity. It's probably the reason I just can't stop fucking talking; these.rusty cogs in my brain have started spinning... fast.Alright can we just forget about all that stuff please and talk about good etuff.Yeah, glass half-full shit. What do you got?I got a little buzz going.So... there's that. I got that.Ah! Jesus, you scared the shit out of me. You're always doing that. Why are you always doing that?Yeah I've been kind of catching up with people around here.Yeah I think I'm starting to figure that out myself.I think probably tomorrow. I gotta lot of stuff I got to do back in LA. I'm gonna have to find a new job. So...Yeah. How? I mean when?Well actually I was supposed to meet my friend Mark. But how about later tonight?Yeah.Yeah.You still have your egg baby? Mine broke the first day.Yeah, well she gave us a C cause my partner fell on some ice. My-wife tell on some ice and killed our egg baby.Why's it brown?Oh. Large laughs at Mark's earnestness.You kept her little blue skirt on.It's a girl, she's wearin' a skirt.Shorts?Oh. They laugh. Large flips through an album.You collect \"Desert Storm Trading Cards\"?Really?So like how much is this one worth?\"Night Vision Goggles.\"Dollars?So do you have the complete set?Someone stole it?For drugs they sold it?Wolf Blitzer.Yeah, sure I just...Nothing I just...Nothing I just, I told Sam I was gonna hang out with her today...What are we doing in the mall. I don't wanna be in the fucking mall.What do you mean, how do I look guilty?Oh, no.Hey.I know.What?Tina who?oh yeah, gymnastics Tina. How'd she do it?This is Sam. Sam this is Karl.Oh. He walks off.Why'd you say that?Yeah. Yeah I was. Just this thing. So you're like what, working here?Yeah, definitely.Washers?Oh, washers. I never use those. I never knew what they were for, so. I just always threw them away. I never used washers. Silence.Yeah, well it was great to see you, man. I'm sure I'll see you around.oh, well we gotta run. I'm listed. Just call information. It's been so long since I've been home I don't even remember it.Oh, is that what it is?Why are you buying knives? I don't need knives. They arrive at the counter. A young Black woman with enormous gold earrings and long fingernails stands at the register.So how often do you go?You know, Mark, it's my last day in town. I have money. I can give you some.Or fuck, take Jesse's - the guys a millionaire.This is Sam.Mark's picking up something.So were you there?Were you on the call to my uh... to the house?Ch.Yeah.I should go.You know me enough to know I'd travel for your funeral right? I was kidding yesterday; where ever it was... you know I'd be there right?Okay, stop. What the fuck are we doing?Dude, we've been patient all day, but it's my last day in town and you haven't told me what the fuck we're doing. I mean if you told me we were going on a six hour scavenger hunt for blow I would have passed.Well I think we've corrupted this innocent girl enough for one afternoon.Yes, you are. And that's what I like about you. And I don't want this fucking guy taking you to the bottom of a quarry in a sketchy-ass neighborhood to find some Pitbull's raping each other or... crack whore's huffing turpentine or whatever it is that you have usSo.Don't be cute.Don't talk about knights in front of Mark. It's a sore subject.Pun intended? Beat as Mark gets it. He comes after him.I never even knew this was here.Can you imagine the guy who's job it is to fight for the right to build his mall on some like geological phenomenon?You're not gonna tell us what we're getting?So... knock. Knock and barter for \"Dessert Storm Trading Cards\".ah nothing, just hanging out in an old boat at the bottom of a quarry in Newark.Yeah, it just started pouring all of a sudden.No thanks.What is it that you do here? What is this place?Oh. Wow.Not at all.Why? What do you think you'll find?Yeah. \"Albert's Abyss\".You know \"my whole life I've had that same anxiety that if I didn't discover something or... save something or...Yeah. That I'll have somehow wasted my time here. And that somewhere, whatever force created us, would resent me for it.Yeah, thanks.Yeah, that would be great.r, Hey Albert lGood luck exploring the infiniteSo I don't know if I'm gonna see you.To be honest, I don't even care anymore. Mark pulls out the bag. It practically falls apart it's 80 wet from the rain. He pulls out an ANTIQUE NECKLACE with a square pendant on it. He puts it in Large's wet hand.This whole day was about this?It's my Mom's favorite necklace.No. I don't want to play this game.Okay.I really don't wanna...Shut-up.I guess I could put it in my scrapbook, if I had a scrapbook. They wait.I think so. I don't feel any more coming.Yeah.It's funny; this thing reminds me of this really random memory of my mother. Its so weird, I haven't thought about this in so long, but this great memory I have where I was a little kid and I was crying for one reason or another and she was kind of holding me and rocking me back and forth. And I could see the little balls in this thing just rolling back and forth. And there was just snot dripping down my nose.This is love. And it just felt so... good to be there. So safe. And I didn't feel safe very often, but at that moment... Tears are now streaming down his face as well as Sam's. She holds the plastic cup in her hand.It's so funny isn't it? But I think that's the single most amazing moment I remember of my Mother. 'Cause she wasn't sad and she wasn't being prodded to be happy, she was just there.I would say that it's Love.This fucking hurts.Fuck. I feel like I just get so much thrown at me; like there's so much speeding by me in a day that I feel like if I look up from the sidewalk, I'll get dizzy and fall down. So it's like I just... barrel through and don't look up, so I'll just never fall, you know? And that's really... and you know it's so sad to say this, but that's really how I've been living my whole life.Yeah.Yeah.Come here. She comes in for a tight embrace. He kisses her gently on her cheek with his eyes closed, then rests his head on her - shoulder.Safe.Dad? He sits up startled.Sorry to wake you.I've been on a pretty crazy little journey these last couple of days.No, I just... maybe I have been.But when were we ever all happy, Dad? I mean you always say that, but when was that? When was this time that you have in your mind that you wish we could all get back to? 'Cause I don't have it in my memory. Maybe if I did I could help steer us back there. But we should...What I did? What I did?! You know what, Dad? I'm gonna forgive myself for what I did right now: I was a little boy and somebody made a shitty latch. That's what I think now. And I'm not gonna... I mean I'm not gonna take all those drugs anymore. Because they've left me completely numb. I have felt so fucking numb to everything I have experienced in my life. And for that; I'm here to forgive you. Gideon site up against the headboard.You've always said you wanted us to have whatever it is we wanted. Well maybe what Mom wanted more than anything, was for it to all be over. And for me, what I really want more than anything, is for it to be okay with you for me to feel something again; even if it's pain.This is my life, Dad. This is it. I've spent twenty-six years waiting for something else to start. So no, I don't think it's too much to take on. Because it's everything there is.We deserved nothing more than you. And you deserved nothing more than us. Large puts his hand on the center of his father's bare chest.You and I are gonna be okay. You know that, right?I don't want to hurt you.Sam.Is that true?Look at me. Sam, look at me. This is not over. I'm not putting a period at the end of this thing. I'm putting like... an ellipses on it. Because I'm worried that if i don't go figure myself out, if I don't go land on my feet and be okay on my own, I'm gonna fuck this up. And I don't want to do that . This matters too much to me.This isn't a conversation about this being over. It's about me needing time to... Look, I just fired my psychiatrist, I gotta go out and find a new one. He stares off. Decision time.- I gotta go. I'm gonna call you. As soon as I get there I'm gonna call you. She nods; heartbroken.Look at me. She doesn't. LARGE Look at me. She turns.You've changed my life, Samantha. And I've known you for four days. This is the beginning of something big. But right now I gotta go. He kisses her on her mouth. As he pulls away she arcs her head to touch his lips for one more second.Remember that idea I had about growing and working stuff out on my own and then finding you when I'd figured myself out?Yeah the ellipses. Its dumb. It's an awful idea. And I'm not gonna do it. Because like you said, this is it. This is life. And I'm in love with you, Samantha. I think that's the only thing I've .ever been really sure of in my whole life. I'm really fucked up right now, but I don't want to waste any more of my life without you in it. Okay?Because I think I can do this. I know I can. I want to. We have to. Yeah? Tears stream down her face. She smiles her angelic smile.Okay. What do we do? He looks at her and smiles like we've never seen him smile;", "clean_line": "bread bread vietnamese restaurant ll turns walks sup thanks yeah guys doin nice silence yeah yeah great plans couple days

Sorry.Same.Where the fuck you been, man? You're like still acting and shit, right?That's cool. I hear that place is pretty tucked up, man. I got a cousin who's a writer out there. He says that place is mad crazy. Coke everywhere, parties, horny-ass bitches...What?Terry.No bitch, he's in LA now. He's a writer. He's writin' a movie about snowboarders or some shit, X don't know. I should introduce you to him Largeman, maybe you guys could do something together.Supposedly.Yeah, he lives up on the hill. We're probably gonna head over there right after we bury your mom.Same.All right. Well, welcome back.holy chit look at this guy! Everyone looks to Large at the end of the line.Get the fuck up here, bitch! This guy does not wait for a beer! This is a movie star! This is Jersey's DeNiro and shit. Mark sloppily hugs Large. Others slap him five as Large awkwardly navigates between variations of hugs and handshakes.Press junket.You like that? That's improvisation, bitch. You can use it.You see this?That was him. Dug the hole myself.Nah. Ugly motherfucker though, huh? It pains Large to even try to respond to that.You want to see the most fucked up thing? They arrive at the landing outside a door with a \"New Jersey Devils\" poster on it.This is the tucked up thing. Be swings the door to the bedroom open revealing the dark bedroom of your average teenage boy. A teenage couple drunkenly makes out on the bed. The mattress has no sheets.Check that out. Mark points to a hole in the ceiling where a ceiling fan has been ripped out. Wires dangle. The fan lies next to the bed.Shut the fuck up. Who is that, O'Malley? I'll beat your aaelI can't tell what's more disgusting; those two hooking up in that room, or those two hooking up.Here, bro. He passes Large the golf book.Really? But you're like a movie star and shit.Okay, how 'bout this. He holds up a bottle of Tequila with a ribbon around !.to neck.He got the shit kicked out of him.How do you know? He got the shit kicked out of him by Tyrell Freedmen.He knocked your teeth out.Air bloody tooth.What the fuck is Klingon?Don't be shy, Tim.You've got to be kidding me.You must have gotten it confused with \"Pleej artulyah. Hagtooth pleep.\" Theylaugh.You know what that means, Tim?well I do. It means get the fuck out of my house before I chop your fuckin' head off. Silence. Large stares at Mark in disbelief, then starts to LAUGH. They all start to join him except Mark. They stop laughing.He's just a fast-food knight.My Mom did it.Don't bring those fucking people here anymore, Mom. Or I'm leaving. I'm serious. No Medieval Times people in this house. He passes the bong to his Mom. She smokes it, then sits down, forcing them both to slide over. Several cats surround her_I'm declaring it. Now. It's declared, now. Thank you. No more.No, Ma. I'm not doin' the stupid tapes.Mom, shut-up about those fucking tapes. It's a scam.In China.It's bullshit. You were just all baked,out and you thought it would be a good idea.I do apply myself, Mom; everyday, I work my ass off burying dead people, okay? I'm only twenty-six, I'm not in any rush. What's your rush for? Just let me be, all right? I don't rush you.Fine. Do'em.She drives me crazy. She's gets all fried out and makes me feel like I gotta impress her all the fucking time. And you know what? I'm okay with being unimpressive; I sleep better. Large site forward abruptly.How could you leave all that Lithium? I was totally gonna hit you up for some.Vagina!Hey. Nice to meet you.I'm sorry I yelled- 'vagina' just now, I didn't see you.Nice. Let's get fucked up. Off Large's smile we:One, two, three! Everyone jumps into the pool SCREAMING except for Large. He stands there staring at the water.You look like a drunken beaver. They all laugh- Sam swims over to him sitting on the steps. She smiles at him.How 'bout some fucking furniture dude.Silent Velcro. Lucky motherfucker. I got an idea: loud tape, we'll make millions.You're the one who said they sent you away.I'm dangerous and I didn't get to go to boarding school.You're gay.For her funeral.Please don't remind me.Fuck you.Don't you fail if it breaks?Jesse cooked his. They both laugh.'Cause my wife was Tanisha Lubin.He's a boy. His name's Shantel.They're shorts.Yeah, he's a boy, Shantel. They're shorts.Fuck yeah, dude. Those are collectors items. Do you have any idea how much those things will be worth some day.Hell yeah. That shit's like an investment. I have lots of little investments - all over the place. I'm gonna sel3. 'em all one day and just live off 'em.Which?I don't know. Mint; maybe two, three.Yeah. But it's too early. You don't sell'em yet. Don't you know anything about investing. I'm gonna live off that shit. That \"Schwarzkopf\" card is worth at least five something. And if you have the complete set it's worth like thousands.Almost. The corners are bent on my \"Friendly Fire\" and someone stole my \"Wolf Blitzer\".One of my Mom's Medieval Times friends, man. Drug addicts.Yeah.It doesn't matter if you're a rich house wife looking for your muscle relaxers or some crack head drying cars: people will do anything in this town to get their drug money. Now look, what do you gotta do today? I gotta little going away present for you. But I kinds gotta track it down. So, can you give me a ride?What?Say it... speak.She can come, I don't care.We're making some money for your present. Just don't look so guilty.Oh, no. Benson.Don't give him your number. Karl approaches.Just that Gleason kid. Oh, and Tina.You remember Tina. She was like anorexic. She did gymnastics... Sam is horrified by this conversation.I don't know. She wasn't Jewish, I didn't bury her.Listen I'm gonna go grab that thing. So just hang here and I'll be back.Hey. We gotta get going.Why is it always the losers who get into the pyramid schemes? Why isn't it ever some charming hot girl nagging you incessantly to buy shit?Detergent or some shit. The thing I don't understand is, if it worked, why would he be working here. The guy's a freak; he pops Darvocet like it's Ritalin.I'd like to return these.Actually, no. It was a gift. She clicks her tongue. She begins filling out a form.They're not sharp enough.No. Not for what we need them for. They couldn't cut cans.No, but in the commercial they say that if I wanted to cut cans I could. But with these knives I can't.Yeah, they're just... I don't want them; not sharp enough. She rings it into the register and counts out bills to Mark.A major loop-hole in the Handi- World return policy permits returns without receipts on items below forty dollars.I hit every employee once, then wait for them to. hire. new ones. Luckily, no one works at Handi- World for very long. Except Karl Benson.I don't need your money, I'm making my own right now.i don't take anybody's money, Andrew. I make my own. Favors are bad news. And the only thing worse than a favor, is a favor involving money.This will only take a second.Got it, let's go.I've got that Nitrous tank for you, so can I get that info?Dude we're kind of in a rush.Wow.He's the guy who needs that thing. Look I brought you the tank, so can you just tell us where to go now?we're in a hurry.Blow? Please. If I was gonna give you coke we'd have gone to the high school football practice and we'd a been reeling five hours ago.Wow. That's the most worked up I've ever seen you.I'm gonna kill that motherfucker.You're dead. They play wrestle as Sam watches.I've heard about it. They were supposed to build a mall here I think.They love their mall's here man. Okay let's just find this guy and get outta here.It's a surprise, you'll see. Mark walks on ahead of them down a path that winds down alongside the abyss.I guess this is it.Yeah. Are you Albert?What do you mean, this is nice.It's hardly the bottom, dude. Did you see that cliff? Albert returns with FAYE, an equally gentle and caring looking woman in her early thirties.Never crossed my mind.That's it. Thank you. They all stand.I know. Don't you wanna know what's in the bag?I'd be lying to ya if I told ya this was my plan all along.Hey, if you ever need a Kato, you know where to find me.

I always watch the weather report before I go to sleep.What?I would have too, but no. Nothing. What?What ?What? No.Its not that.No. Because they know she drowned, Andrew.No.No. Yee!I know!

Why would you ever want to think that? Large moves closer to his father who SOBS with his head in his lap and his arms over his head.

We couldn't sit there and not help those children. So we sent him letters and pictures for years and then I got really into ice skating and we kind of forgot about'em. Then one day the phone rang and it was Titembay and he was at the dry cleaners around the corner and he said that he was going to school at Rutgers and living in the dorms, but since he was used to living with his tribe he'd much rather live with his family.Yeah and he's been here ever since. He's an amazing guy, you gotta hear some of his stories. I mean this guy struggled through so much because he wanted to learn. I think of what he's accomplished and I just feel so lazy.

Large lifts his index finger in the air and twirlsa it.Oh, I've done that one before. She bursts out laughing. He smiles. SAM So I got to bury this hamster before the dogs eat him. You warms help?Yeah.I know. They stand in silence.It's not that we're bad pet owners or anything, it's just that we've had so many of them over the years.What are you thinking about?Yes.No. A second ago before I asked.What, dates?Oh. Who else died?How did she die? Large thinks about that.When?Oh my God. Tears roll down her face.I don't know, I'm sorry, I'm not usually like this. It's just so sad. It's so tragic. Isn't it? It is. It's like real life tragedy or something.What should we do?We usually say something.its not funny. Jelly you were a great pet. Tears roll down her face.I'm so, so sorry I forgot to take the wheel out of the cage. I'm so sorry about that.Mom, no.No, I couldn't have.Mom. I'm asking you seriously.Were. They cross to the TV room where they find Titembay wearing rubber gloves, seated next to an open tool box, dusting the coffee table for fingerprints and referring to an open text book. White powder reveals fingerprints everywhere, including the TV screen.I can't believe you're showing him this.Okay this was great, but we have to go now.Mom.I love you too. Olivia kisses Sam on her forehead.Mom.Okay, good-night. Night, Tim.Oh c'mon. Don't ya see that it's a joke. If you can't laugh at yourself life's gonna seem a lot longer than you'd like.I lied again. I have epilepsy.I had a seizure in the law office where I work and they said their insurance would only cover me if I wore \"preventative covering\".The helmet I was carrying. Large is silent.Oh come on, that's funny. I'm the only person in the world wearing a helmet to work who isn't putting out fires or racing for NASCAR. But what do you do? I can't quit; their insurance is amazing. What can you do? You laugh. I'm not saying I don't cry a lot, but in between I laugh and realize how silly taking anything very seriously is. And plus, I look forward to a good cry. I just love the way it feels.What do you mean?It's okay.Hey! what are you doing?Can you swim?Fooled me. I thought you just had a cramp.I can't whistle if it makes you feel any better.There's a handful of normal kid things I kinda wish I'd missed. She floats on her back beside him.So how long are you gonna stay here?No, I mean in Jersey.I still feel at home in my house.Maybe.Where is it?So why did they send you away? She takes a sip of her beer.Why did they send you to boarding school? Large looks to Jesse and Mark.But obviously something happened. I mean there must have been an event.Am I being too nosey?Yeah.Shut up.Why?You couldn't make her happy.Oh my God.Until now.It sounds like a punishment.You're \"in it\" right now aren't you?My Mom always says that when she can see I'm like working something big out she'll say, \"Are you in it right now?\" And I look at you, and you tell me this story and... you're... you're definitely \"in it\" right now.Maybe that's why you've been getting those headaches.Good stuff?I got a little buzz. That's what I've got. What do you got?Who's that?Hey.Nice meeting you.Hi.You delivered him?Wow.Nice to meet you.How do you know she's a hooker?Julia Roberts married Lyle Lovett.I'm not innocent.He was protecting me.He likes me.You're my knight in shining armor.Wow.Yeah I remember reading about it in the paper.I must say, I've been continually impressed today with how each new place you bring us manages to be weirder and weirder.I'd love some tea. Large and Mark look at her.Wow. So how deep does it go?It's kind of an odd job isn't it? Guardian of an infinite abyss?No.Save something from being discovered.Well thank you for the tea.What is it?Why not? I'm curious. She's sitting here, across from you and you can say anything at all. All the things you never got a chance to say.What?Oh, my God, Large I think I see one.Yeah, I do. Don't move, we should save it or something. She finds a clear plastic cup.Here don't move, I'm gonna get it. She tries to coerce the- tear off his cheek into the cup, like a child capturing an inch worm.Is that it?Well if you do, let me know and I'll grab the cup, okay?This was a good idea. Keep talking.oh, Large I'm never gonna be able to get all these. They laugh. She moves closer, wrapping her legs around his waist to hug him close. She kisses his-'wet cheeks.I'm never gonna be able to get all these, am I?To be your Mom.Look at me.Let go. Listen to me. Just don't hang onto any of it anymore. You're holding on so tight and you just... you don't have to hang onto any of it anymore. Just let it all go.Just let it all go. He cries with his elbow over his eyes.What do you feel? Describe it. That always helps me. My mom always says, \"What's the word that's burning in your chest...\" She touches his chest with her hand.What is it? He looks away. Soared.Look at me. He does.Yeah, it is.I know. But that... that is life. if nothing else... That is life. St's real. And sometimes it burns. But maybe... it might be all there is.Tissue? They both laugh; a release.Trying to barrel through.Well it sounds like you were due to fall.How do you feel? On Large's face as he thinks about that question.What are you doing?No. Why? How can you... how could you... What's going on? What happened? We can figure out the long distance thing. Don't... this is a good thing, Large. Don't... you're gonna be... please don't do this. Shestarts crying.No.What are you doing?The ellipses?Yeah.", "clean_line": "recognize high school tv play retarded quarterback retarded stares cool great job man mean thought retarded good corky kid
