{"Mute-Witness": {"ANDY": {"raw_line": "Cut. Brilliant.Okay, I think we have a little communication gap here. Natasha translates in Russian what Andy just said.When I said \u00abmore\u00bb......I didn't mean trash the fucking set.This is not Chekhov. You're not the star. You're just another victim.You get stabbed. You die.I want to see the pain.I want to see the blood spurting.Okay, from the top.What's the holdup ? The angry bearded man speaks angrily in Russian.What is he saying ?Okay, well, let's just do the close-up of the corpse now, and that'll wrap it for today.All right. Okay. So, what I want to do is zoom in, do a slow zoom into the puddle of blood... On another part of the set, behind the dining room, Billy kneels down in front of a big ancient-looking wooden trunk.What... what is going on now ?One shot, one more shot !One shot ! I can't believe this.Ohh ! Right ! His dummy falls off the balcony on Monday.Karen, she's got her own car.Yeah, yeah, yeah! Fiesta ! I'm making my famous chili con Clarke. Near Andy's car, Alex, the assistant producer we just saw on the set, is opening the door of his car.Alex !... what do you say ? You coming ?Well, try and stay awake.Yeah !Damn !Honey ! Honey, can you get that ?Honey !Hello ?... Hello ?Hello ?I'm still thinking about dinner.Ask her about the mask.Oh, man !Oh, man !Man ! Oh, man !Shit !We're eating out tonight.You hungry ?What's going on ?What ?Ambulance !Come on !Guys ! Guys ! English, please.I would've let you done tests.What I mean is... What I mean is... Let's see their film. I'll know if it's real.I'm...I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.Oh, my God!It's for the actors. They put the stuff in their mouths.What ? What ?It's fake blood.Hey, we need that.Well, I've never been more embarrassed in my entire life.Please, has she even seen a real murder ?Oh, come on, honey. We all bought the guy cutting me up tonight. Even I believed it.I'm gonna let that slide.No offense, Billy, but I'd like to re-shoot the stuff today using that guy's knife.Whatever. It looked good.Please, Billy, take some of mine. You'll feel better.Okay.Could you pass me the salt, please ?Listen... I'm sorry. All I can think about now is the movie, but as soon as we get back, I promise, I'll learn.Come on. I can understand some of what she's saying.Okay, how about this ?Means \u00abmakeup\u00bb, right ?That was close.Honey, you coming or what ?I don't care ? I don't care ? Fine, fine. I'm calling the American Embassy tonight, okay ?Not for us. My dad gave me the duty officer's direct number before we left, just in case. So say goodbye. He waves to Billy, who waves back to him. She blows a kiss to her sister, who blows one back, and enters her building.Right... Right... Right, sir. Right, sir. Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. So, I really appreciate the call. I'll give Dad your best. Right.I told you. There's nothing to worry about. He says the film's the biggest piece of shit he's ever seen.Would you leave her alone ?What ?Oh, my God, it's trashed !I'll call the police !How do you work this thing ? Oh, there it is.We don't have any diskettes.Not that one. That's my script.What ?What ?This is all a big misunderstanding and... Excuse me, but this is...You don't have to arrest us. Why is he arresting me ? This is ridiculous. I'm an American citizen. Do you understand what I'm saying ? Now, I'm a director.You know, I'm directing a movie here in Moscow. I'm bringing a lot of money in this place.And my father, okay, he knows a lot of big people, and... Listen.You want money ? Is that what you want ?I don't understand what is going on here. We don't have a diskette !The diskette. You know, I mean, this is ridiculous. We don't have a diskette. That's what I'm saying.Karen, get the key ! Get the key ! Unlock me !Right. Let's get out of here.Why ?Da.Da.Mmm... It's not what you think. What do you say ?... How do you ?... In Russian, what ?...What ? What does that mean ?Hello ? We need help !I'm a director, and I'm making a movie here. This is not a movie.Put the gun away. You look like a hit man. He thinks we're gonna kill him !This is not even ours !Well, I think we should call the cops.Well, we can explain this.I'll take these too.What... what are you doing ? That... that's Red Square.Oh, perfect. MOSCOW - RED SQUARE - EXTERIOR NIGHTThis damn gun, I can't work the safety.Holy shit !What ?Nice night, isn't it ?I'm just taking a piss. Right, you know, just... The watcher walks slowly down the ladder. Karen reaches the ladder, climbs on something we don't see, and catches the watcher's foot through the steps of the ladder. The man falls and rolls all the way down the ladder. He is unconscious and Andy ties his wrist to the ladder with the handcuff. Karen joins him. Andy seems very happy about the successful operation.Well, whoever it is, they're coming here.I can't work the safety.Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.Okay.Karen !You thought we were tourists, huh ? Guess again, pal.Don't move. Don't move! I'm talking to you !I'm warning you. Don't move or I'm gonna shoot you ! Okay !Billy ! Billy ! Billy !She's fine ? She's okay ? Billy mouth the words \u00abI'm fine\u00bb and shows him the special effect device on her stomach. Larsen comes behind her and takes her by the shoulder, saying a few words in Russian. Billy says something in sign language to Karen.A cop ?Sorry.Oh !... this is the remote. I get it.Whoops !... Shit. I'm sorry.Ciao !...What's the matter ?The expression ?The car ?The car...", "clean_line": "cut brilliant okay think little communication gap natasha translates russian andy said said mean trash fucking set chekhov star victim stabbed die want pain want blood spurting okay holdup angry bearded man speaks angrily russian saying okay let close corpse ll wrap today right okay want zoom slow zoom puddle blood set dining room billy kneels big ancient looking wooden trunk going shot shot shot believe ohh right dummy falls balcony monday karen got car yeah yeah yeah fiesta making famous chili clarke near andy car alex assistant producer saw set opening door car alex coming try stay awake yeah damn honey honey honey hello hello hello thinking dinner ask mask oh man oh man man oh man shit eating tonight hungry going ambulance come guys guys english ve let tests mean mean let film ll know real fine fine fine oh god actors stuff mouths fake blood hey need ve embarrassed entire life seen real murder oh come honey bought guy cutting tonight believed gonna let slide offense billy like shoot stuff today guy knife looked good billy ll feel better okay pass salt listen sorry think movie soon promise ll learn come understand saying okay means makeup right close honey coming care care fine fine calling american embassy tonight okay dad gave duty officer direct number left case goodbye waves billy waves blows kiss sister blows enters building right right right sir right sir thank mr ambassador appreciate ll dad best right told worry says film biggest piece shit seen leave oh god trashed ll police work thing oh diskettes script big misunderstanding excuse arrest arresting ridiculous american citizen understand saying director know directing movie moscow bringing lot money place father okay knows lot big people listen want money want understand going diskette diskette know mean ridiculous diskette saying karen key key unlock right let da da mmm think russian mean hello need help director making movie movie gun away look like hit man thinks gonna kill think cops explain ll red square oh perfect moscow red square exterior nightthis damn gun work safety holy shit nice night isn taking piss right know watcher walks slowly ladder karen reaches ladder climbs catches watcher foot steps ladder man falls rolls way ladder unconscious andy ties wrist ladder handcuff karen joins andy happy successful operation coming work safety yeah yeah coming okay karen thought tourists huh guess pal talking warning gonna shoot okay billy billy billy fine okay billy mouth words fine shows special effect device stomach larsen comes takes shoulder saying words russian billy says sign language karen cop sorry oh remote whoops shit sorry ciao matter expression car car"}, "KAREN": {"raw_line": "You make the blood flow by squeezing the bag with your elbow.

She saw that.What ?They could have soaked the sheets in fake blood afterwards.Oh ! Wait. Wait. Ah ! She says... Well, there were more bags in there before.I don't get it. I mean, Billy's a pro. She'd know the difference between a real murder and a gag.That's my point. If what she saw tonight was real, then she has seen the difference, right ?Because you're a wuss.It was her knife. God !Shut up.You could at least make the effort. Andy stops eating, looks at Billy drinking water and then at Karen.How often have I heard that ?What ?Wrong. It means somebody's look, the expression on their face.What Billy said she'll never forget the look on the girl's face tonight from the moment she knew she was gonna die. She said the pain and the terror was real. You can't act that.No, honestly, you can come back to our place, and we'll set up the couch if you want.You're not on one of your \u00abI'll show her how independent I am\u00bb kicks, are you ?Andy, don't you care about her ?It's the weekend.
