That kind of music! You know what they call colored folks in them songs? Have you got any idea?NIGGAZ! I don't wanna say the word. I won't say it twice, I'll tell you that. I say it one time.In the course a swearin' out my complaint.NIGGAZ! Two thousand years after Jesus! Thirty years after Martin Luther King! The age of Montel! Sweet lord a-mercy, izzat where we at?WeeMack down to Pascagoula buyin' a big thumpy stereo player?! So he can listen to that word in the house next to mine? Sheriff, you gotta help that boy!You gotta take an innarest! EXTEND that helpin' hand!Well God bless ya. Don't wanna be tried and found wantin'.Many many tunkalow parzen, Sheriff Wyner. Many many tunkalow parzen!You have been tried and found wanting. Don't want that writin' on the wall!Feast a Balthazar!John The Apostle said: Behold there is a stranger in our midst, come to destroy us!He's a good man. Just needs instruction. Dog, you in peoples' way.You need somethin' to eat, Angel?Mm... gizzards...Othar, I went'n complained about WeeMack, I hope it'll do some good. That boy hangin' by a thread! Over the pit! Fiery pit! \"I Left My Wallet in El Segundo\"!...Sixty-seven years of life, forty- six years of marriage, you mean to tell me you never one time suffered from piles? It's the human condition, most humans anyway. Like that ball player said: world's got two kinds of folks -- them that's got piles and them that's gonna get 'em. But you was always healthy as an ox......Passed on before you got piles. Mmmmhmm. Thank the Lord you wasn't sick. You don't wanna sicken 'n die. No, you wanna pass nice 'n peaceful... go to sleep one night, wake up in the glory land... woof......Well who's that now, Pickles?PICKLES!Go get 'im!Go get Pickles, I didn't let 'im out!Oh, he's up the tree again. Your gonna have to shimmy on up.Huh? No, he won't come down less you fetch him. He'd set there til Gabriel blows his horn if someone didn't shimmy up. Up with you now!Look, I don't want no doubletalk. If you ain't gonna fetch him down I guess I gotta call the po-lice...They ain't gonna be happy. Every time they come fetch him down they swear they won't do it no more...Don't upset him, now!Well you let him out.What, like Elmer?Fudd?Sore bone, well I guess that's appropriate. You ever study at Bob Jones University?It's a bible school, only the finest in the country. I send them five dollars every month.I'm on their mailing list. I'm an Angel.They list my name in the newsletter, every issue. I got the literature here, you wanna examine it.I was wondering, til you let Pickles out. Then in all the excitement--Yeah, I got a room. I'm lookin' for a quiet tenant. Fifteen dollars a weekWell you can see the room, but I don't like double-talk.Wait a minute. You got some kind of band?So you don't play hippity-hop, \"I Left My Wallet in El Segundo,\" songs with the titles spelt all funny?Gospel music?Rococo, huh? Well, I guess that'd be okay.Little dank, ain't it?You containing it okay.That would be a shame.That man has a lot to say.And every word of it the truth.Stout, too.It was a good sermon. That man has a lot to say.And the choir was all in good voice. Mm-mm-...Who could that--Somebody die?No smoking in this house.You ain't gonna make a racket, are ya?Hmph.That's okay, don't stop on account of me.Huh. I just thought you might like to see-what a you gotten up to, honey? Why you sweatin' like that.You mind! I don't want that kind of talk in my home, even in the root cellar. This is a Christian house, boy, none of that hippity-hop language.Sometimes it's the only way!...I'm tryin' to help you, son!...Better yaself!Don't make no never-mind he's transported!You been smokin'?My youth I was in church, I wasn't walkin' around fiery. Youth ain't no excuse for nothin'! Well, anyway... only came down to show you the fife....Othar's fife. He burned his own.Mm-hm. I thought maybe bein' a musical man you'd be interested.Cut it himself and burned the holes. Israelites called it a kalil.Kalil, fife, same thing. You can read about it in the Bible. Ain't nothin' new under the sun.Gone these twenty years. He was some kind of man....Blowed the kalil.I don't know nothin' 'bout that. Othar didn't study no shofar, to the extent a my knowledge. The kalil was good enough for my Othar......Some kind of man....You just a readin' fool, ain't you Mr. Dorr.Mm-mm.Wisdom of mankind, what about the wisdom of the Lord?I know who he is. Kinda creepy.Who was Helen? She wasn't a loose woman, was she? Some kinda whore a Babylon?Oh Mr. Dorr, why you are such a gallant man...Othar loved that music... Yes, I got a widow-lady friend...Huh? Excuse me.Sheriff Wyner, how you doin'...Mm-hm.Hang on there, Sheriff, somebody I want you to meet.Why, you chasin' a gang of bank robbers? Get on in here say hello....We was just havin' tea, talkin' about Othar--...Hm... Bussed his own dishes. You can always tell a gentleman.Mm-hm, with me'n Othar.Come on up to his room.Mm, he's neat.Probably went down to the cellar to play with his friends.What the......What the... Why, Professor!...What you doin' havin' tea down there?!...Land of Goshen! Get out from under there!Why of all the...Why I never!My friend Mrs. Funthes is here so I'm about to go on out. I just wanted to leave y'all with some cinnamon cookies......Y'all sound pretty good. It'd be nice if you'd come by the church some day, give us a recital.Oh, I see all right, but we don't make a big whoop-dee-do about denominations; everybody welcome at our church. We've had Methodists come in. Episcopals. Even had a Jew come in once with a guitar back in the sixties.Professor, this is Rosalie Funthes, Rosalie, Professor G.H. Dorr, Ph.D.He a man of learnin'?...What in the name of heaven was that?Didn't hear anything?!They using the house to practice music a the rococo.PICKLES!...You catch Pickles now!You let the cat out!Professor, I'm surprised.I hadda fix tea. I wanna talk to you, Professor, don't you be leavin'. And don't make any more noise! And you!...I told you, I don't want any smokin' in here!You get back down those stairs!Hush! Down those stairs! We havin' tea now! I be down shortly....He's the tenant.I don't know what you boys been up to but I wasn't born yesterday and I know mischief when I see it. Now I want an explanation, but first I want you boys to get your fannies up here with y'alls period instruments. I been tellin' the ladies about your music and they wanna hear you play....Hmph.Hmph.Now, I wanna know what's goin' on.Hmph....What about all that money?This don't smell right. I'm callin' Sheriff Wyner.Mm-hm.Lord have mercy!Stolen money!...Just one penny?Well that's prob'ly true...Well... it's hard to see the harm in it... One penny......I'm sorry, Professor.No. It's wrong. Don't you be leadin' me into temptation.No, it's just plain wrong. Stealin'. I know your intentions were good, and I won't call the police if you give the money back. But I gotta see that you do it.And all a you gotta go to church with me next Sunday.I made up my mind. You can double- talk all you want, but its church or the county jail.You think it over. I gotta feed the cat.What you doin'? What you doin' with my pillow there?I'm displeased with you! Colored boy like you, falling in with that trash downstairs!...Ashamed a yourself! Didn't your mama raise you right!Mm-hmm.I don't care they was receptive or not!Well that is a shame.Well I'm glad y'all came to see the light, anyway. I'm gonna have some tea and go to bed.Hmm.Mm-hm.Professor!...Hmm. Couldn't face the music.Scoot now! Outa the way!Sheriff, I gotta make a statement.I guess it can wait, but it's about that casino money.Something? Everything! I got it at home.The money. Two point six million dollars. Down in my root cellar. All stacked up nice and neat.Bunch a desperate men that stole it put it there, that's how! They was musicians of the Renaissance period, played the sackbutt and so on -- well, it turns out they really couldn't play, although they could recite poems to break your heart. Their ringleader speaks in dead tongues.I tried to get you to see him! That night?I had to yell at 'em 'bout stealin' all that money and I guess I made 'em feel pretty bad 'cause they picked up and left without takin' the money. But I was peeved with 'em, Sheriff, they'd been up to all sorts of mischief, come close to blowin' up the house, disturbed Othar no end.Wouldn't you be? All that racket!And they let Pickles out too!No, he's back, but what you want me to do with the money?Keep it?Well... I know it's only a penny offa everybody's policy...I know folks don't much care. Could I... You s'pose I could...Could I give it all to Bob Jones University?...Well, long as everybody knows.You're welcome, sheriff. Just doin' my duty.Leaning, Leaning, Safe and secure from all harm. Lean on Jesus, Lean on Jesus, Leaning on the everlasting arm....What a fellowship, What a peace of mind, Safe and secure from all harm.

But won't the feline eventually tire of his lonely perch and, pining for his master's affection, return on his own initiative?Well then couldn't we perhaps offer him kitty treats and enticements, or if not foodstuffs perhaps squeaky little toys of the kind formerly manufactured in Hong Kong but now produced in the other so-called \"Little Tigers\"......of the Pacific Rim? The point bein', do we have to actually ascend the tree--Police...No need to call the authorities. I did this often as a youth -- why, I was a positive lemur... Here, kitty...I wouldn't dream of it... harmless little felix domesticus... Come to G.H...I thank you, madam, for your act of kindness.I certainly did and I do apologize no end. Allow me to present myself, uh, formally: Goldthwait Higginson Dorr, Ph.D.Beg your pardon, ma'am?No no, Ph.D. is a mark of academic attainment. It is a degree of higher learning bestowed, in my case, in recognition of my mastery of the antique languages of Latin and Greek. I also hold a number of other advanced degrees including the baccalaureate from a school in Paris, France, called the Sorbonne.I have not had that privilege.That's very gener--Indeed.Perhaps when my head has recovered from its... buffeting. Mrs. Munson, are you at all curious as to why I darkened your door, as the expression has it, on this lovely camelia-scented morn?I quite understand. The fact is that I saw the sign on your window advertising a room to let, and it is the only such sign among the houses of this charming, charming street.I quite understand. Madam, you are addressing a man who is quiet -- and yet not quiet, if I may offer a riddle......Perhaps you can show me the room, Mrs. Munson, and allow me to explain.You see, madam, I am currently on sabbatical from the institution where I teach -- the University of Mississippi at Hattiesburg. I am taking a year off to indulge my passion -- I don't believe that is too strong a word -- for the music of the Renaissance. I perform in -- and have the honor of directing -- a period instrument ensemble that performs at Renaissance fairs and other cultural fora......thoo-out central and southern Mississippi. We perform on the instruments for which the music was originally composed, in the belief that... that... Why, this is lovely...The word \"band\" would be, in this context, something of an anachronism. Though we do play together -- hence the word \"ensemble\" -- the nature of the music is such that one would hesitate to apply the epithet \"band\" with its connotations of jangling rhythm and ear-popping amplification.Madam, I shudder. I quake. The revulsion I feel for modern popular music, and all other manifestations of contemporary decay, is, I have no doubt, the equal of y'own. Why, we play music that was composed to the greater glory of God. Devotional music. Church music.Well-inspired by the gospels, certainly. The vintage, of course, is no more recent than the Rococo.But I certainly don't propose to inflict our rehearsals on you. May I enquire -- do you have a root cellar?Yes, yes, yes, this looks promising...Oh, indeed, but that only improves the acoustics......Marvelous. These earthen walls are ideal for baffling the higher registers of the, uh, lute and, uh, sackbutt. That's why so much music of the cinquecento was played in crypts and catacombs. Yes, this will do nicely......This is perfect. This is more than perfect. I can scarcely contain my glee.Allow me to pay you a week in advance. Allow me to pay you two weeks in advance. Allow me to pay you a month in advance. I cannot countenance the thought of these charming apartments being tenanted by someone unappreciative of their special je ne sais quoi.My dear Mrs. Munson, I do so hope this is not an inopportune time for our first practice--I beg your-- Oh!...No no, no bereavement, though it is so kind of you to enquire. No, the hearse is simply a vehicle commodious enough to accommodate all of the members of our ensemble. And of course our instruments, contrived in an age ignorant of miniaturization......Let me introduce you to my friends, my colleagues, these devoted and passionate musicians... This is Gawain MacSam, our bassoonist......General Nguyen Pham Doc, viola da gamba......Clark Pancake -- a multi- instrumentalist, but with his remarkable embosser Clark specializes in wind instruments, and is especially accomplished on the French horn......And, finally, Aloysius \"Lump\" Hudson. Lump is our sackbuttist and -- thank you, Lump -- I see you've also brought my fiddle...Oh no. Oh no no no no no. No, we shall recuse ourselves to the basement where we shall be -- I think here the expression is uniquely appropriate......as quiet as the crypt.What do you think, General? Present any problems?...Good then....All right, gentlemen, why don't we all crowd around and go over the plan....This, gentlemen, is the Lady Luck, gambling den, cash cow, Sodom of the Mississippi delta -- and the focus of our little exercise. Here is Orchard Street......and here is the residence of Marva Munson, the charming lady whom y'all met moments ago. Gentlemen......You... are... here. Now. This brings us to this square......Gentlemen, I believe you are all aware that the Solons of the State of Mississippi, to wit, its legislature, have decreed that no gaming establishment shall be erected within its borders upon dry land. They may, however, legally float upon any watercourse defining a state boundary. But while the gambling activity itself is restricted to riverboats, no such restriction applies to the functions ancillary to this cash besotted bidnis. The casino's offices, locker rooms, facilities to cook and clean, and most importantly its counting houses- the reinforced, secret, and super secure repositories of the lucre -- may all be situated... wherever. Gawain -- where is wherever?Where is the money?And where is the counting room?And what, to flog a horse that if not at this point dead is in mortal danger of expirin', does the dotted square represent?Underground... Mmm... During the casino's hours of operation the door to the counting room is fiercely guarded, and the door itself is of redoubtable Pittsburgh steel; when the casino is closed the entire underground complex is locked up and the armed guard retreats to the casino's main entrance. There, then, far from the guard, reposes the money, cosseted behind a five-inch-thick steel portal, yes, but the walls, gentlemen, the walls of that room, are but humble masonry, behind which is only the soft loamy soil deposited over the centuries by Ol' Man, the meanderin' Mississip', as it fanned its way back and forth across this great alluvial plain......This earth....Any questions?...Yes, Lump?The General here, whose curriculum vitae compahends massive tunneling experience thoo the soil of his native French-Indochina, will direct our little ol' tunnelin' operation....Clark Pancake, while a master of none, is a jack of all those trades corollary to our aim. He will be doin' such fabricatin' and demolition work as our little caper shall require.Gawain is the proverbial \"inside man\". He has managed to secure a berth on the custodial staff of the Lady Luck, thereby placin' himself in a position to perform certain chores whose precise nature needn't detain us here, but whose performance shall guide this expedition to its happy conclusion.And this brings us to Lump. To look at Lump you might wonder, what function could he possibly fill, what specialized expertise could he possibly offer, to our merry little ol' band a miscreants. Well gentlemen, in a project of such magnitude and such risks, it is traditional -- nay, it is imperative -- to enlist the services of a hooligan, a goon, an ape, a physical brute, who will be our security, our fist, our batterin' ram. Lump is our blunt instrument, and on all our behalfs I wish him a warm Mississippi welcome.Well gentlemen, here you are, men of different backgrounds and differing talents, men with, in fact only two things in common: one, you all saw fit to answer my little advertisement in the Memphis Scimitar, and, two, you are all going to be, in consequence, very very incredibly rich. Let us revel in our adventure, gentlemen. Let us make beautiful music together. And above all, gentlemen, let us keep it to ourselves. What we say in this root cellar, let it stay in this root cellar....Lump has a very excellent point.No no, madam, we were about to take a break anyway. The glissandi on this particular piece are technically very demanding and I think we would all welcome a moment of relaxation.Sadly, Gawain is given to--As well you should, ma'am. But Gawain at times is so far transported by his love of the music of the early Renaissance as to--I understand your--Certainly not, madam. I understand your indignation. And I was offering explanation, not excuse. I myself am offended by those who cannot find the proper words to express themselves and have recourse to--Yes, yes......A fiery lad! But then Youth is fiery! A fact often remarked upon by the poets of the Romantic era....Did he?Oh, I am indeed--Ah.Indeed not....I don't suppose Othar ever turned his hand -- or, uh, heh-heh-heh, turned his lip -- to the shofar?...The ceremonial ram's horn, sounded by the priests of the Hebrews?Oh my. Oh my my my my my. This is a severe setback. I am distraught. I am more than distraught, I am devastated. Oh my, this is quite the monkey-wrench heaved into the meticulously engineered construct of our little escapade.I am beside myself. I am at a positive loss for words.Oh madam, we must have waffles. We must all have waffles forthwith!...Oh we must think. We must all have waffles and think, each and every one of us to the very best of his ability! Perhaps if you apologized to the man and gave him flowers, or perhaps a fruit basket, with a card depicting a misty seascape and inscribed with a sentiment.Well then, perhaps, surely, a chocolate assortment has been known to warm the heart of even the most hardened misanthrope, especially if it's a premium chocolate, imported, say, from Switzerland, or the Netherlands, or some other of the so- called \"Low\" countries be they Dutch or Flemish or Walloon--Oh my my, it seems that the poet was right: Troubles never singly come.I confess myself to be puzzled as well. I thought we all understood that, so far as our little enterprise is concerned, mum, as the saying would have it, is the word--Gentlemen, please!...Gentlemen, this sort of behavior does you no credit in the eyes of your colleagues, or in those of the other patrons of this waffle house!Gentlemen, I propose that we consider the matter of this woman, Mountain Water, to be--I am so very sorry. I propose that we consider this matter to be closed, and we shall chose to trust her, since we now have no choice, and since she shall share only in Mr. Pancake's portion of the booty.Gentlemen! And the manner of disposing of our igneous impediment is also settled. That leaves only the question of Gawain retrieving his job.Yes yes, I must confess, madam, that often I feel more at home in these ancient volumes than I do in the hustle-bustle of our modern world. To me, paradoxically, the literature of the so-called \"dead tongues\" has more currency than this mornin's newspaper.In these books......In these volumes, there is the accum'lated wisdom a mankind which succours me when the day is hard or the night lonely and long.Oh yes, the Good Book, mm. I have found reward in its pages. But for me there are other good books as well; the heavy volumes of Antiquity, freighted with the insights of Man's glorious age. And then of course I love, love, love the works of Mr. Ed G'Allan Poe.Oh no, madam, noooo. Not of this world, true; he lived in a dream, an ancient dream...\"Helen, they beauty is to me Like those Nicean barks a yore That gently, o'er a perfumed sea, The weary, wayworn wanderer bore To his own native shore... \"One doesn't know who Helen was, though I picture her as bein' very, very extremely... pale....Miz Munson, I was tryin' to think of some way of expressin' my gratitude to you for takin' in......this weary, wayworn wanderer......It's just a modest little ol' present, why it's practically nothing at all.Oh no madam, I blush. I melt. No, I just happened to hear of this gospel concert tomorrow night, The Mighty Mighty Clouds of Joy, and I thought you and a friend from church, perhaps...The concert is up in Memphis, but I have arranged for a car service to transport you thither and, needless to say, back home at the concert's termination. My friends and I will be rehearsing here tomorrow evening so you needn't worry about the security of your charming little old house...Well that was very... refreshing... As you know......we academics are inordinately fond of wedgin' ourselves into confined spaces. At Yale the students will see how many of their number they can enclose in a telephone booth; Harvard, a broom closet.There was the goldfish-swallowin' craze, of course, a different but related phenomenon... Ahem... I hope I didn't spill any tea...Yes, madam?Oh madam, you are too kind. Our music, however, is -- how shall I put it? -- rather Roman in its outlook; many of our pieces were commissioned by the Holy See.Indeed. Excuse me, one moment, ma'am, and I shall see you off......If you gentlemen can labor harmoniously in the course of my absence, then perhaps upon my return we shall be prepared to explode that vexin' ol' piece a igneous.Well of course in my youth I was simply known as Goldthwait...I remember my father telling me -- and it is one of the few memories I retain of the man, from one of his visits home, and how I do cherish it -- he said, \"Goldthwait, you are not formed as other little boys.\"G.H. number two was self-educated; he had no career, as such, though the state recognized the breadth of his readin' by making him librarian at the state nervous hospital in Meridian, where he was a distinguished inmate.I'm... quite sure... that there is... no cause for alarm......Why, I'm not even absolutely certain that I heard anything at all.Well, something, perhaps, but......nothing that need discompose us, was the sense I was trying to convey......Miz Munson, I will not have you missing your musical recital. Why, you go ahead now. Miz Funthes, you as well, I beg of you......I shall call the gas company, or the water company, or whatever subterranean utility is implicated in this little... occurrence... I shall see to the matter... as only a highly educated classicist could.I gather there was a premature detonation--I propose that we get our fallen comrade to the hospital, and the General shall follow when he manages to recover the severed digit.The house is perfectly in order, but we need medical attention for Mr. Pancake who, during the disturbance, pinched his finger in a valve of the sackbutt.The General is even now exercising every effort to retrieve your mischievous little pet. Please go, go and enjoy your concert, and we shall see you later in the evening. Au revoir, mes dames!Despite our little setback we find ourselves on schedule to penetrate the vault......here, this afternoon, having successfully blasted that little ol' rock to pieces during Miz Munson's choir practice....Clark, perhaps you can run us through the game plan for what remains of our tunnelin'.And will you be able to wield the drill with your maimed extremity?Yes, Clark?Yes but you see, Clark, this is not what you just called \"some other line of work.\"This is a criminal enterprise, not to put too fine a point on it, entailin' all manner a risks not involved in honest labor. Governmental regulations an' civic safeguards cannot be assumed to apply to antisocial pursuits.I think that in this instance Gawain has a very excellent point. I--Now that that matter is settled, let us synchronize our watches before Gawain reports to work. In... twenty seconds... it will be twelve-sixteen exactly... fifteen...No, in fifteen seconds -- now eleven seconds -- it will be twelve- sixteen... eight...Six... five -- yes, Lump?Welcome back, gentlemen, mission accomplished I see. I am so very very delighted......Congratulations. Congratulations. I have some cold duck on ice for the occasion.Gentlemen, to we few. We who have shared each other's company, each other's care, each other's joy, and who now reap the fruits of our communal effits, shoulder to shoulder, from each accordin' to his abilities so forth whatnot. We have had our little diffences along the way, it's true, but I like to think they have only made us value one another the more, each coming to understand and appreciate the other's unique qualities, potencies, and, yes, foibles. I suggest that we shall look back upon this caper one day, one distant day, grandchildren dandled upon our knee, and perhaps a tear will form, and we shall say, Well, with wit, and grit, and no small amount of courage, we accomplished something on that day, a feat of derring-do, an enterprise not ignoble -- we, merry band, unbound by the constraints of society and the prejudices of the common ruck, we happy few. Gentlemen -- to us!I do beg your pardon?Well that time, and more, has most certainly elapsed.I need not remind you of the importance of obliterating any trace of a connection between the vault and this house. It was of the essence of this plan that it should appear that the money had simply vanished. Without a trace. Spirited away, as it were, by ghosts.The conundrum of the undisturbed yet empty vault, the unsolvable riddle of the sealed yet violated sanctum, is of the utmost importance not only to make our caper innelectually satisfying. It is also exigent as a matter of practical fact: I remind you that if a tunnel is ever found leading to this house, this house's owner knows all of your names.Therefore -- to draw the unavoidable conclusion -- someone shall have to reenter the tunnel to reset that charge....Properly speaking, madam, we have been surprised; you are taken aback. Though I acknowledge that the sense you intend is gaining currency through increasing use....You have returned from your devotions betimes.Yes... Yes...Well, first, my dear boy, we follow the General's example......and refrain from panic. Secondly, we cooly, calmly, collectedly think... think...Hsst... Madam......Mrs. Munson, if I might have a word...I assure you I shall be--She shall be down shortly......Tea. Dainties.Yes, Lump?Madame -- or rather, mesdames -- you will have to accept our apologies for failing to perform since, as you see, we are shorthanded. Gawain is still at work and we could no more play with one part tacit than a horse could canter shy one leg.Perhaps I could offer as a poor but ready substitute a brief poetic recital. Though I don't pretend to great oratorical skills, I will happily present, with your ladies' permission, verse from the unquiet mind of Mr. Ed G'Allan Poe....\"Ladies, thy beauty is to me Like those Nicean barks of yore...\"\"That gently, o'er a perfumed sea The weary, wayworn wanderer bore To his own native shore... \"\"On desperate seas long wont to roam, Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face, Thy Naiad airs have brought me home To the glory that was Greece And the grandeur that was Rome... \"Goodbye, ladies. We had such a pleasant time.Yes indeed, and the thirst for knowledge is a very commendable thing. Though in this instance, I believe when you hear the explanation, you will laugh riotously, slappin' your knee and perhaps even wipin' away a giddy tear, relieved of your former concern.You see Lump here is an enthusiastic collector of Indian arrowheads and, having found one simply lying on your cellar floor, a particularly rare artifact of the Natchez tribe, he enlisted us in an all-out effort to sift through the subsoil in search of others. Well, in doing so, we apparently hit a motherlode of natural gas -- I myself became acutely aware of the smell of \"rotten eggs\" -- and it was at just this unfortunate moment that the General here violated one of the cardinal rules of this house and lit himself a cigarette....Ah. The money. The money is... Mr. Pancake's.He only just re-mortgaged his house in order to pay for the procedure that will correct the wandering eye of his common-law wife, Mountain Water, who suffers from astygmia and strabismus and a general curdling of the vitreous jelly. Mr. Pancake however is an ardent foe of the federal reserve and is in fact one of those eccentrics about whom one occasionally reads, hoarding his entire life savings either under the proverbial mattress or, as in Mr. Pancake's case, in a Hefty bag that is his constant companion....Steel Sack.Madam -- if you please. Yes! Yes! It was a lie! A fantastic tale! You have us! Dead to rights! But please allow me to tell you the truth -- in private.Madam......What I am about to reveal to you, you may find... shocking. Mrs. Munson, I must tell you that we are not... what we appear.We are not in fact musicians of the late Renaissance. Nor of the early or mid period. We are, in fact... criminals! Desperate men, madam! We have tunneled into the nearby offices of the Lady Luck gambling emporium and have relieved it of its treasure!It is true that the Lady Luck is a den of iniquity, a painted harlot luring people into sin and exciting the vice of greed with her false promise of easy winnings. Oh, her gains are ill-gotten, yes, but I offer no excuses -- save one! We men have each pledged half of our share of the booty to a charitable institution -- the General, to a placement service for Southeast Asian refugees; Mr. Pancake to the Blue Ridge Parkway Conservancy; and Lump to the United Jewish Appeal. As compensation for use of your house we had planned to donate a full share to Bob Jones University, without burdening you with guilty knowledge by informing you of same. But you have wrested the information from me! Now it is all on the table. Now you have it, the whole story, the awful truth.Yes, yes, shamefully I admit it, yes! But find the victim, Mrs. Munson, I challenge you! Even the casino itself, that riparian Gomorra, shall suffer no harm! It has an insurance company, a financial behemoth that will cheerfully replenish its depleted vaults! That is its function! And the insurance company itself is made up of tens and tens of thousands of policy-holders so that -- we have done the calculations, Mrs. Munson! -- so that at the end of the day, at the final reckoning, each policy- holder shall have contributed only one penny -- one single solitary cent -- to the satisfaction of this claim.Think of it, Mrs. Munson! One cent from thousands upon thousands of people so that Bob Jones University can continue on its mission! Why, I have no doubt that, were the policy- holders aware of the existence of that august institution, why, each and every one of them would have volunteered some token amount to the furtherance of its aims!Yes madam, sadly, the criminal stain is upon my soul, but the benefit shall accrue to any number of worthy causes. As long, that is, as the secret stays with us. And I, surely, shall not be the one to divulge it.Excuse me, ma'am?Madam, I must strenuously protest--Madam--And... engage in divine worship?But--Yes. Unfortunately, Mrs. Munson has rather complicated the situation--...Not easy to do. Many reasons. Practical ones: a quiet neighborhood, a sleepy town. Reasons of moral repugnance: a harmless woman, a deed conceived and executed in cold blood. No, Gawain; would that it were simple!I shudder. I quake....You sir, are a Buddhist. Is there not a middle way?Well... I suppose you are right. It is the active nature of the crime, though, that so horrifies -- the squeezing of the trigger, the plunging of the knife. But, think a moment -- look at the other tools we have at hand....We have the cellar. We have masonry and trowel. Perhaps we could simply... immure her.Ahh but gentlemen, we delude ourselves. Think of the woman's piteous moans as we lay tier upon tier of brick. Think of her lamentations as we fit the last brick into place, appealing to our better selves, the higher angels of our nature, our recollections of our own sainted mothers... No, I fear that we lack the sand to commit such an act. No... no... shortest and most painless is best. Let us confront reality. Gawain's gun... the retort muffled by a pillow... into the brain... the affair of an instant. The only question is... who wields the weapon....I believe it is traditional, in such circumstances, to draw straws.Gentlemen, no special pleading, no exceptions. It's in the nature of the situation that we would all prefer to be excused.Why... this is most... irregular.My my, this is most irregular.I'm afraid that Mr. Pancake is right, my dear fellow. We cannot draw straws again; the exercise loses all credibility if you show that the loser can simply beg off doing the job.Gentlemen, please!Oh my.Well this is most irregular. We will need a Hefty bag.She is in the kitchen. I shall distract her while you steal out with the carcass.Well, my dear Mrs. Munson, I have outlined your position to my colleagues and I now return to you to return our collective verdict.There was much spirited discussion and an atmosphere of frank give-and- take. Some of our number were initially appalled at your proposal that we simply return the money; some were more receptive.And that attitude, madam, was a factor in our discussions. To a man, I must say, they were devastated at the prospect of not being able to contribute to their respective charities.Indeed. But at the end of the day, your position prevailed, and the men have decided that we shall return the money -- every last cent of it! -- and attend Sunday services, rather than spend the remainder of our years wasting away in the Mississippi Men's Correctional Facility. Though that was the original preference of some.So the money shall be returned tomorrow at the opening of the casino office. Enjoy your tea, madam......and congratulations on having recalled to the fold five poor, confused sheep who had momentarily strayed.Yes... yes, they just arrived.What in heaven's name......General!\"...Like those Nicean barks of yore That gently, o'er a perfumed sea...\"\"...The weary, wayworn wanderer bore... \"\"...To his own native shore.\"Excellent. I believe, at last, we have the right man for the job....T'was our at\u00e9 brought us to this pass...Our overweening pride... The old woman is a more potent antagonist than one had imagined......Now, Lump, I'm afraid it falls to you to finish the job....The comedy must end.Oh dear. Oh dear oh dear oh dear.Oh dear, Lump. I feared that those would be your words. Not that I don't appreciate your giving the matter the benefit of your thought. But please recall, young man, our respective functions in this enterprise. I am a professor, the professor as you yourself so often say, the thinker, the \"brains of the operation,\" trained in fact in the arts of cogitation. You, Lump, are the goon, the hooligan, the dumb brute whose actions must be directed by a higher intelligence.No buts, dear boy! Do not repeat the error of thinking! Now is the moment of praxis! Now, my dear boy, you must act!Think of the riches, Lump, that you and I alone shall divide! Recall the dream of wealth untold that first drew you to this enterprise!And reflect also that if you decline to act, forcing me to do so, then you shall no longer have any entitlement to the money! Your offices shall have been nugatory!Of course! My hand would be forced!You?! Allow? Not allow? What presumption! You stupid boy! You very very extremely stupid boy!Perhaps... it had to be thus.\"...Lo, in yon brilliant window-niche How statue-like I see thee stand...\"...Hm. A raven?\"...The agate lamp within thy hand......Ah, Psyche! from the regions which Are Holy land!\"", "clean_line": "ma beg pardon pickles terribly sorry madam won feline eventually tire lonely perch
