But I am interested.They had a lot of weight. Too much.You saw them guys. You think that half ass crew was organized?I think its a part of somethin' bigger.Tomorrow morning we put our friends under the lamp. If they know this \"someone else\", we'll know him too.Try this. I know you're too fuckin' dumb to be any more than a courier. I know you're coverin' for someone else. NOW TELL ME WHO THAT SOMEONE IS!YOU AIN'T A RAT?!LOCK THE DOOR!I'll teach you what commitment is... I'll throw you in an eight by nine and have you fucked in the ass by every inmate in the state of Louisiana-- AND THAT'S THE REST OF YOUR LIFE!GIVE ME A NAME!--GIVE ME A NAME!!Two tours in 'Nam. '69 and '71. He's a jump marine. Weapons trained, explosives. Seven and a half out of a twelve year stint for federal robbery. Two in Angola. A year in DeQuincy. Three in El Reno with a transfer to Lewisburg. Then Marion with a brief stopover in Leavenworth. Released from Oxford, 1981.His stay at Marion, they kept him in \"H\" block.Yeah, life sentences. Jesse only had twelve years.He ain't just woodwork.Alright. Give him room.We're mobile.Let's take him in the car. Wait'll he's stopped. Watch your backgrounds.Don't move. You motherfuck, I'll blow your head clean off.Shut the car off slowly.CALL AN AMBULANCE! NOW!Toss everything.I'm Detective Lieutenant Bud Carter, of the East Baton Rouge Parish Precinct. So how you like Baton Rouge?Water broke. She's en route to the hospital.This is new.What's the cyanide for, Jesse?Impurities from what?You're in a bad situation here, pal.There's more, I know it.Remember him? Ten months ago, a judge gets popped with a .357. Well I got a Ruger from Wheeler's toilet and rushed it through ballistics.It's a solid match! Dead on.A stack of bonds taken from the home of a Baptist Minister...Murdered. He and his wife. Looked like a robbery gone to shit then; I want it opened back up.I don't know; I do know they'll post his bond. That's why I need a price they can't come up with overnight.I'm right about this, Mike. When a guy's lookin' at two hundred years and he ain't upset... It's like when your wife is accusing you of fuckin' the neighbor, but she don't know you're fuckin' her sister too. You're pretty calm about it, right?It's 'cause we hit the wrong nerve. The guns, the other shit, the time... He can have that conversation. And he is. And he ain't upset. He's makin' eye contact, 'cause we're fallin' short. This guy knows things. He knows where bodies are.Yeah...Charlie... You had an inmate in '75, named Jesse Wheeler.Charlie, you there?Well, we got him on weapons and burglary. But I got a feelin' there's more.What else?So what the fuck happened?He attack the guards?Open the door.Heard you refused a public defender.At the gas station...When you were arrested, I put a gun to your head. You expected someone else.And your house? Guns. Mass supply tells me, intent to sell. Cyanide in the fridge, explosives...tells me you're scared.I know who you are.One more thing, pal. I saw the judge this morning. There is no bond.Put 'em in prison, they get stronger. Everywhere you send one, they recruit in numbers. Within five years, their numbers were over ten thousand.What do you got there, Shep'?Stay focused. Get back to Wheeler... I need an angle.That's if he was a surface informant. I don't want him to testify. I want to keep him on the street. Look, this guy's been in it a long time. He's up to his elbows; wants to shake his hands free. I can feel it.I'll handle that.We got one chance here. 'Cause if this falls short... Jesse Wheeler's worth more dead than alive.It's there. It's gotta cook a little longer, that's all.C'mon, Mike, you know what's goin' on. Ray Wheeler compromised Jesse. By that, he compromised the Brotherhood. Don't tell me there ain't no fuckin' leverage.Well we ain't sleepin' till we find it.Lynn Wheeler. We haven't been properly introduced. I'm Detective Bud Carter.You have a ride home?Take a cab.'You need anything...anything at all. Be sure to call me.Want a cup of coffee?Yeah... When I want to talk to someone, without giving the impression he's cooperatin'.You got a problem.To start with, you're lookin' at two hundred years.I know you can do it. But can your family?Your brother's dead, Jesse. As we're sittin' here now, he's on a slab at St. Gabriel's Morgue. The coroner's callin' it, \"suicide\". You and I both know that's a load of shit. You do the time-- sure. And you never see your kid. 'Cept in here. You can recruit him. Your wife...plans...everything... Gone. 'Less you talk...to me.What?...I dislike what they represent in the system. Not as a whole.I believe we survive by integrating safety. Understanding hate, and how to stop it.Are we still in prison, or we back at the compound, havin' mass?No, don't dictate to me what put you in here, or question my intentions with your overcooked revolution! 'Fact, I think you wanted out 'fore I even got to you! That's why you distanced yourself. That's why you're out there crackin' safes. Lookin' to live a life that ain't AB.How about personal warranty?Yeah, that's right! You've been a part of the problem so long, you've forgotten what the fuck that is! \"Finance...\" Your wife came here on a bus to see you. I sent her home in a cab. Is that your outside fuckin' finance?!Let me give you a little insight, pal. As to what I know... And what you think you know.This is today...Is that your house? That's your wife, right? Who's this guy?Know where he's takin' them? Takin' your family? I got a pretty good fuckin' idea.Look at your wife, Jesse. Look at her face. And your son. They look safe to you? I'm all you've got! I'm all your family's got! And the longer you're in here, they're up for grabs.So either you let that happen... Or I get the judge to allow bond. This never sees trial. And you work for me.Well my word counts.I want a body, Jesse.Yard dog. Relax.Clear it off! Come on, find the edges!Jesse tells me six months.We'll get an ID. Remember, we got the guy who put 'em there.Hey, Mike.How long you been with the Attorney General, Fitch?Is that right...No.Keep him on the street without protection, he winds up dead.Lost my appetite.I set this up. Me and Jesse. If the Feds want to help, that's fine. But not him.They ain't takin' us serious, Mike. They send us some kid with a year under his belt?! He don't even know what state he's in... You want him in charge?!This is bullshit.Now we're talkin'.Your family's safe now. Let's go to work.We know that, Fitch. He's workin' on it.--A wire?! He just went back to work, you want him to wear a fuckin' wire? Put a tap on that God damn lawyer's phone, that's what you should do.It's information, Fitch.I'm telling you, your agents best pull their shit together! Who the hell y'all trying to protect?!That ain't what they did--!My informant, that's right!--Well I better be informed! 'Cause this ain't fallin' short! Now, any of y'all got a collaborative agenda in the works? I want to see it. These other agencies, what time-lines they lookin' at? What deadlines and why?And is there a purposeful lack of communication between competing agencies, who are right now charting future mistakes, as we fuckin' speak?!We're not talkin' about me!!What?!Where the hell you been? Two days missin', you broke protocol. Three, and you're a flight risk. Agents'll hunt your ass down.This is the job. If I don't hear from you, I can't protect you.Those ain't my guys!There is no \"out.\" Not for either of us. Not till it's done... Get me that list.I'm losin' him, Mike...It ain't gonna settle, it's gonna blow. I can feel it.Push 'em back.The Feds. All these suits, fuckin' outsiders. Everyone. Get me some room. Some time to reel this thing in.Jesse. 'The hell you doin' here?Hey. Meet me at the office in ten minutes. Cobb and Marandino too.I'll explain later. Just get there. Now.Let's hit it.Shepard! No...We run 'em now, Mike. Right fuckin' now!It's not.Got I.D.?Put a tap on that line.Do it.And?Give us a minute, Doc.There is no family.I'm sorry...Y'all fuck with me? Huh? You want to fuck with me?'Look at me when I talk to you. You try and kill me? You like killin' women and kids?Get out of my way, Fitch.While your agents build their cases and set for court, he'll erase the debt owed to all of you. Overnight.That'll never happen.'Cause it's over, Fitch. It's done. He has nothing. Why do you think he lit that fire? To plant a flag. To let us know he doesn't need our protection. Doesn't want it. He would've just left 'em for dead.No, the truth is, Fitch, you ain't got balls big enough to relate to this guy. If you had listened to me, we wouldn't be in this situation. Jesse wouldn't be in this situation. And you wouldn't be askin' stupid fuckin' questions! I'll bring him in myself. Just keep your agents off my ass.You know who I am?You know who the fuck I am?!Who's Richard Morris?! Why was he killed?I'll break every fuckin' bone you got. Start talkin'.Can't what?! What can't you do?!You piece of shit, talk!His family?Where's Lucian Adams?Lucian's goin' down. You either go down together, or you give him to me.You're a dead man, Kiersey.What do you got?Alright.Hold him off. I'll square it with him when I get to the Quarter.It's Bud. I got a number.Get your ass down here.Here we go.C'mon. Show me somethin'.I'm in the French Quarter. Sittin' on AB activity.Don't know yet. I got Harold Kay so far.Looks like they own the God damn block.I can explain--Hold on, Mike.Go ahead...Mike, I've got Edgar Bingham now. Just showed with two of his crew, for a sit down with Kay.Got 'em.Mike, I need Kiersey to place a call. Five minutes, or this opportunity's gone.We wait.Hold position. Give me a head count.It's Jesse...Let him go.Let him go.That's exactly what we're gonna do! We got no way inside. Let Jesse go in hard and draw fire. He pushes Lucian out to us. Stand the fuck down. I'm on my way.Call it in! Local and SWAT! Get the place surrounded!Jam the alley! No one goes in or out!Stay on the door! I'm goin' in!I got him...
