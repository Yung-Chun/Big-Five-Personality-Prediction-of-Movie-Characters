{"Curious-Case-of-Benjamin-Button-The": {"CAROLINE": {"raw_line": "The wind, Mother... They say a hurricane is on its way... You've been asleep... I was waiting to see you...I've forgotten what the weather can be like here. I've lived with four seasons so many years now.Can I do anything for you, Mother? Make anything easier?Do you want more medication, Mother? The doctor said you can have all you want.A friend told me she never had a chance to say goodbye to her mother. I wanted to thank you, Mother, for bringing me into this world. For raising me so well.I wanted to tell you how much you've meant to me. I'm going to miss you so much...Are you afraid?No, please go call...I hope I haven't disappointed you, Mother.I wished I had more to show for myself. I know you would have liked to have had grandchildren.My life hasn't been all that... normal...I'm either a step ahead... or a step behind...What?An envelope?This one?What do you mean?It's dated \"April 4, 1985.\" It says, \"New Orleans.\" \"This is my last will and testament... I don't have much to leave... few possessions, no money really... I will go out of this world the same way I came in, alone and with nothing. All I have is my story... I'm writing it now while I still remember it...\"\"My name is Benjamin...\"Is any of this true?Some pages seem to be torn out here...There's an old streetcar token.Shallow.No, that's fine...please...Dorothy had to go home...\"On Sundays the families would come and visit...Are you alright, Mother?This man. He loved you from the first time he saw you.Nobody has ever loved me that way.He crossed out something... and then he's written... \"When...\"I'll get the nurse...I haven't spent as much time as I would have like with her the last few years.The next page says...Did you say something, Mother?It seems to be getting worse.Are you hearing me, mother?What?Do you want me to go on reading?\"Things were changing quickly.\"I think I should find out what's going on...Is this what you're looking for?You said you wanted this?\"I had gone..\"Did you love him, mother?\"...We were working in Murmansk, Russia...\"Are you upset, Mother?Would you like some socks?Do you want me to stop reading?\"I couldn't wait to see her again.\"He said, \"The most beautiful,\" Mother.He said...Oh, that's great.Isn't that good news, Mother?The hurricane. It is going to miss us.Would you like me to keep reading?He said, \"Things were becoming different for me...\"Did you Mother?You couldn't have known.I've never seen these... You never talked about your dancing very much...\"I didn't leave right away...\"I'll get the nurse...He said, \"I went back...\" But then there are a whole lot of pages torn out...\"...I listened to the sound of the house...\" I think I already read that... The next thing he wrote... he spilled something on it... It's hard to read... Something about \"sailing.\" Does that make sense?I don't understand. When did you meet Dad?Did you ever tell him about this Benjamin?\"That night, in the Caribbean I had a visitor...\"I thought the wind had shifted away...Mother?He said, \"She found peace.\"You were pregnant? You never said anything, did you? I mean, what happened to the child?They said if you needed oxygen...\"She flourished...\"He was my father...? This Benjamin was my father?Why didn't you ever tell me...?!You never said a word to me...I need to go for a minute...You're all I have.\"You grew, like the doctor had said, normal and healthy...\"I almost wish I didn't know any of this. I feel odd, reading...it...Where did he go?There are postcards...They're all addressed to me... They're from all sorts of places...They're for my birthday. 1970...I would have been two... \"Happy Birthday.\" \"I wish I could have kissed you goodnight.\" \"Happy Birthday, you're five.\" \"I wish I could have taken you to your first day of school.\" \"Happy Birthday six-year-old.\" \"I wish I could be there to teach you how to play the piano...\" \"11...\" \"...Told you not to chase some boy...\" \"13...\" \"Held you when you had a broken heart...\" \"1983.\" I was fifteen. \"I wish I could have been your father.

I hope you start all over again...\"I'd been gone for a long time...You ready, Mom?Is something wrong, Mother?Hi...That young man was my father?Is there anything we need to do?That's the last thing he wrote...What happened to him after that last time with you, Mother?I'm going to see what they want us to do...It's a train schedule.\"I'm on a train in India filled with people.\"He started to write something else... \"I'm going...\" But he stopped...I wish I had known him.I'd better go and see what they're planning to do...", "clean_line": "wind mother hurricane way ve asleep waiting ve forgotten weather like ve lived seasons years mother easier want medication mother doctor said want friend told chance goodbye mother wanted thank mother bringing world raising wanted tell ve meant going miss afraid hope haven disappointed mother wished know liked grandchildren life hasn normal step ahead step envelope mean dated april says new orleans testament leave possessions money world way came story writing remember benjamin true pages torn old streetcar token shallow fine dorothy home sundays families come visit alright mother man loved time saw loved way crossed written ll nurse haven spent time like years page says mother getting worse hearing mother want reading things changing quickly think going looking said wanted gone love mother working murmansk russia upset mother like socks want stop reading couldn wait said beautiful mother said oh great isn good news mother hurricane going miss like reading said things different mother couldn known ve seen talked dancing leave right away ll nurse said went lot pages torn listened sound house think read thing wrote spilled hard read sailing sense understand meet dad tell benjamin night caribbean visitor thought wind shifted away mother said peace pregnant said mean happened child said needed oxygen flourished father benjamin father tell said word need minute grew like doctor said normal healthy wish know feel odd reading postcards addressed sorts places birthday happy birthday wish kissed goodnight happy birthday wish taken day school happy birthday year old wish teach play piano told chase boy held broken heart wish father replace think hope start gone long time ready mom wrong mother hi young man father need thing wrote happened time mother going want train schedule train india filled people started write going stopped wish known better planning"}, "DAISY": {"raw_line": "If it wasn't for hurricanes we wouldn't have a hurricane season.1928 they stacked people like firewood to close a hole in a levee.It all runs together... like a fingerpainting... I feel like I'm on a boat, drifting...Hmmm. There is nothing to do, Caroline. This is what it is... I'm finding it harder to keep my eyes open... my mouth all filled with cotton...Curious. What comes next...They built that train station in 1918. Your father was there the day it opened... He said a tuba band was playing...Oom-pah-pah...Oom-pah-pah, oom-pah-pah...The finest clockmaker in all of the South built that clock...Mr. Gateau, done for the night, went up to his bed.He just rowed...rowed...away...Oh honey, you could never disappoint me.What's normal? A hat full of sand.I need my brown suitcase... The envelope...I tried to read it a hundred different times... but I couldn't bring myself...Read it to me.Just the sound of your voice...You have such a lovely voice.That clock... Just kept going, year after year after year...Was there just company?Caroline...Did you know turkeys aren't really birds...?They're in the pheasant family. They can hardly fly. It's sad don't you think? A bird, that can't fly.She's going to have a baby, silly. That's what my mother said when I was going to have a little brother. He didn't live long though. He didn't breathe right...Are you sleeping?Come on...Under here...Nobody knows about this but us.Will you light it?Don't be chicken...I'll tell you a secret then you tell me one... I saw mommy kissing another man. Her face was red from it.Your turn to tell.You don't seem like an old person... like my grandma... Are you sick?You are different than anybody I have ever met. Can I?Go on.Oh, darlin', the pain...I can do anything you can do...What's wrong with him?Imagine all the places they're going to see...I wish we could go with them...I wish we could have...Look at that... time just seeped out of me...Somebody will come and mop it up and that will be the end...Benjamin... Benjamin...Where are you going?From everywhere. Write me a postcard from everywhere...There's a box of them... in a velvet bag...Looking for?Of course.Can you imagine... He sent me postcards from everywhere he went... every place he worked... Newfoundland... Baffin Bay... Liverpool... Glasgow...Narvik...Please keep reading, sugar...I wrote him constantly... told him everything I was doing...Oh. Then he wrote me... \"I've met somebody... and I've fallen in love...\"\"...I've met somebody...and I've fallen in love...\" My, that was over... ...sixty years ago.What can a girl know about love?It must have been very cold. I'm glad he had somebody to keep him warm.Oh, excuse me... is Queenie here...?Benjamin...Oh my God it's you... Of course it's you...Benjamin, how are you? It's been such a long time... There's so much I want to know... When did you come back?I spoke to Queenie...she told me you were in the war...somewhere at sea... I was so worried about you...You stopped writing....Beautiful.What else did he say about...I can't get over you're home... I've been planning to come by for awhile... my grandmother, you remember Grandma Fuller... of course you remember her... she passed away...I've been wanting to get some of her things...I can't believe I open the door, and you're actually standing there...It must be fate... What do they call it, \"Kismet\"? I read a book about a man named Edgar Cayce, a psychic, everything is predetermined...I like to think it's fate. What do you think, Benjamin?Have you been to New York...? It's just across the bridge from me... I can actually see the Empire State Building if I stand on my bed... Where have you been? Tell me everything. The last time you wrote you said you were in Russia? I always wanted to go to Russia... Is it as cold as they say...? You wrote you met somebody... did it work out...?...This is the picture of Old Man Kangaroo at five in the afternoon...\"You don't look like an old man anymore...You always said you were different... I think you must be...I would love that...They understand America's vigor and physicality -- they understand the freshness of the American people at their most modern, at their best.Oh my god, I've been just talking about myself...I'm old enough. I`m old enough for a lot of things....I have to go back tomorrow... I wish I could stay...In New York we stay up all night... I eat breakfast in a diner on Houston with red booths and watch the sun come up over the buildings... there's always something to do...Dancers... don't need costumes or scenery.I could imagine dancing completely naked...Have you read \"D.H. Lawrence,\" his books were banned... The words are like making love....In our group... you have to trust people... not be afraid... Sex... is a big part of it... A lot of the dancers... are lesbians... A woman wanted me to sleep with her....Does that upset you?That someone wanted to sleep with me.Let's go back to the house... or get a room somewhere... we can put down your coat...I'm old enough.Do you think you are too old for me... I've been with older men...You look so handsome in that suit... your hair...Good news?I'll just stay under the blankets with my mother. She said nothing would happen to me.Benjamin?Somebody's looking for me?...Benjamin... What are you doing here?I wish you would have called... You caught me by surprise.That's so nice of you to say... These are lovely... Thank you...I better get changed... a group of us are going to a party... would you like to come...?...all the dancers go out together after the show... You're welcome to come with us... There'll be all sorts of interesting people... Let me get changed.I'll get you a drink...This is my friend David... David dances with our company too... This is the man I've told you about, Benjamin...I'll get you that drink. - -I knew I'd hurt you... Maybe I intended to...I did what you told me to... enjoy my life... I'm only going to be young once... I had no idea you were coming. What did you think I was going to do...? You can't expect me to just drop everything, Benjamin... this is my life...Why don't you come with us, Benjamin... There'll be a lot of musicians, interesting people there.... You'll have a good time...I think so. I think I do.He came to tell me his father had died.I was 23...I just didn't care......There are some photographs I think... the zipper part of the large bag...I was as good as I was ever going to be. For five years... I danced everywhere... London, Prague, Vienna, and I was the only American invited to dance with the Bolshoi... It was glorious...But Benjamin was never far from my thoughts...Goodnight, Benjamin...What did he say?Who told you?That was very kind of you... to come all the way here, to see that I was alright.My God, look at you. You're perfect....I wish you hadn't. I wish you hadn't come here.I don't want you to see me like this...What home? Who's we? I'm not going back to New Orleans. New Orleans is your home... I don't have a home... I haven't been home for five years... I'm not going anywhere with you...Benjamin...! I know I'm feeling sorry for myself... But it wasn't supposed to be like this...Do you understand, I don't want to be with you... I tried to tell you that in New York... You just don't listen...We're not little children playing under the table... Remember, when you came to New York. You didn't belong there. I didn't want to be with you then, I don't want to be with you now! I want you to leave! I'm not going anywhere with you! I want you to stay out of my life!I was awfully cruel. He didn't understand. I couldn't have him see me that way...No?I never knew that.Every morning Monsieur Foley leaves eggs and bread and mil,. There's a cafe across the street. People sitting and drinking and talking... I lay on my bed thinking about the rest of my life... about people... about home... until I fall asleep.A man would go up and clean it. Try and fix what was broken.Don't you want to know where I've been?It was what I needed to do for myself.She's still taking care of you.You're not talking. You haven't said more than two words to me.Sleep with me.Yes.Are you sure you don't want to know?...I lived in Lyon......I learned to walk again...I worked in a flower shop......I went to American movies a lot.You won't hurt me...We wouldn't have this... We wouldn't be here... It happened when it was supposed to happen...Don't say that.That's easy for you to say... You'll have plenty of chances.I'm going to enjoy every moment I have with you...Bet I can stay out here longer than you can.You barely have a line, a crease, or a wrinkle... Everyday I have more wrinkles you have less...What does it feel like growing younger?Will you still love me when I can't stand straight... when my skin grows old and spotted...Will you still love me when my step gets slow... when I sleep too much... when you have to push me in a chair...Maybe some things last...Maybe it's something you can't see...I'm cold, Benjamin...Goodnight, Benjamin.Caroline?Dear Robert... some time after that...He knew enough. He loved me as I was. I loved him for who he was. What more was needed?Is anything wrong?...go back to sleep...I loved that house... it smelled like firewood... The chimney leaked smoke... We didn't care... Oh don't stop dear... don't stop...It's just the chlorine...I don't like getting old.I promise you, I'll never lose myself to self-pity again...I don't remember if I turned the lights off. Did I leave the heater on?You have the most beautiful eyes.Peace.Dancing is all about the line... the line of your body...after awhile... you lose the line... and you can never get it back...I figured out if you were born in 1918... 49 years ago... I'm 43... we're almost the same age... In three years we'll meet in the middle...I thought I was far too old... I'm pregnant...The child...I want to breathe on my own... Please... sit down, my darling...I'm pregnant.Hmmm...I thought I heard the nurse slip, and say \"he...\"I know you're afraid.Okay. What's your worst fear?Then we'll love it all the more...I'm going to make this work... This is what I want, and I want it with you...Would you tell a blind man he can't have children? You will be a father for as long as you can. I know the consequences. I accepted that. Your love, loving you, is worth everything to me. For the fiftieth time today I've got to go pee...Ready?Benjamin...Benjamin... the baby's coming...It doesn't change for a moment who you are. You were a gift. Sometimes the gifts we are given are not free.My dearest darling, we were both deprived of him...I was worried you weren't coming back...Read the rest of it, darling.What are you talking about?She'll learn to accept whatever happens... She loves you...Is it that my age is starting to show...? Is that what you are telling me? Have you lost your desire for me...?You're going to leave me, aren't you?You can't leave me.You can't do this to me...!I remember your first birthday like it was yesterday.I don't know. I never heard from him.He'd been gone for a long time...Somebody left their slipper...Are you here to pick someone up?I'm sorry, we're closed now.Benjamin?You're so young.Why did you come back?No... He was telling me a very sad story about a mutual friend we hadn't seen in a long time... This is my friend, Benjamin... you knew him when you were... just a baby...This is a friend of my family's... Benjamin Button... this is my husband... Robert...I'm just closing up...Not very well.My husband. He's a doctor... was a widower... He's an incredibly bright, adventurous man...He's been a terrific father... and a great partner and friend...You're so much younger.You ware right. She needed a father. I couldn't have raised both of you. I'm not that strong.I never thought how it must have broken your heart, too.Where are you staying? What are you going to do?I have to go.Please tell me what he says?May I come in?Nothing lasts.I'm an old woman now, Benjamin.Benjamin...Are you sure?Please read...A year or so after your father passed... There was a call...Hello?... Yes?... Speaking -- I don't understand? Where was that?It's the last house...I'm Daisy...Benjamin.You play really beautifully.Do you remember me? I'm Daisy.It's good to meet you Benjamin. Do you mind if I sit with you? I would love to hear you play.Queenie's daughter saw to it that he was taken care of...Let's see if we can find something else for you to do.I know you can't.What do you mean?It's alright... It's alright to forget things...I wish you'd come down...You're right, you can see everything sweetheart...I think you better come down...I knew a man who could fly. Come down and I'll tell you all about him.And I went to take care of him...How would you like to help me unpack?This is the picture of old Man Kangaroo at five in the afternoon, when he got his beautiful hind legs just as Big God Ngong had promised.That's right...

end all wars had ended.I was told it was an especially good night to be born...She gave her life for me... And for that I am forever grateful...I found a home...\"...I didn't know I was a child. I thought I was like everyone else who lived there, an old man, in my \"golden years.\"I loved her very much. She was my mother.Some nights, I would have to sleep alone.I didn't mind. I would listen to the house breathing. All the people sleeping. I felt safe.It was a place of great routine... Every morning at 5:30, no matter the weather... General Winslow, U.S. Army Retired... raised the flag...Breakfast was served promptly at six.Dinner was served promptly at six.On Saturday nights I would go to Queenie's church...Now, when I look back on it, it was kind of miraculous... But you know the saying, \"...the Lord Giveth and the Lord Taketh away...\"There were birthdays...You could hear when someone left us... there was a silence in the house...For everyone that died, someone would come to take their place...It was Thanksgiving 1930, I met the person who changed my life forever.I never forgot her blue eyes...\"...When the baby came things were different...\"I moved into my own room in the attic... I realized, despite a house filled with people that I loved, I was alone...I spent a lot of time by myself that year...As hard as I try, I can't remember her name. Mrs. Lawson, or Mrs. Hartford, or maybe it was Maple? It's funny how sometimes the people we remember the least, make the greatest impression on us.I remember she wore diamonds... and she always dressed in fine clothing as if she was going out. Although, she never did and nobody would ever come to visit her....She taught me how to play the piano...There were many changes going on, some you could see... some you couldn't.Hair, had started growing, in all sorts of places...Along with other things...I felt like I could do anything, that I could sprout wings...These were hard times... people were doing anything they could to find work...I was as happy as I could be... I would do anything...And I actually was going to be paid for something I would have done for free.His name was Captain Mike Clark... He'd been on boats since he was seven...He took me to meet some friends...It was a night to remember...It sure made me understand the value of earning a living... the things it can buy you..I loved the weekends when she would come and spend the night with her grandmother.I had never thought about life or death that way before...And one fall day... a familiar visitor came knocking on our door...She had taught me how to play the piano.And she taught me what it meant to miss somebody.I had gone to a whore house, I'd had my first drink, I had said goodbye to one friend and buried another... In 1937, when I was coming to end of the 17th year of my life, I packed by bag....and said goodbye...I knew, life being what it was, I would probably never see them again...And I went off to sea...\"... With Captain Mike's crew on the \"Chelsea\"...\"Captain Mike had contracted for three years with Moran Brothers Tug and Salvage... The old ship had been refitted with a diesel engine, and a new sea winch... We went around Florida and up the Atlantic seaboard...We were a crew of seven now... Captain Mike and me... the Cookie... Prentiss Mayes from Wilmington, Delaware......The Brody twins... Rick and Vic...Who got along fine at sea... but for some reason, once they were on dry land... couldn't stand the sight of each other...There was John Grimm, who fit his name... from Belvedere, South Dakota......and Pleasant Curtis who never said a word to anyone... except to himself...Murmansk is on the Barrent Sea, the only ice-free ocean port in the Soviet Union...We stayed at a small hotel with the grand name, \"The Winter Palace.\"Everybody, no matter what differences they had, the languages, the color of their skin, had one thing in common... they were drunk every single night...Her name was Elizabeth Abbott. She was not beautiful. She was plain as paper... But she was as pretty as any picture to me...Her husband was Walter Abbott...He was Chief Minister of the British Trade Mission in Murmansk... and he was a spy...They were long days there...And longer nights...One particular night... when I was having trouble sleeping...And she told me all the places she had been, and what she had seen...And we talked until just before the dawn......And we went back to our rooms... to our separate lives...And every night... we would meet in the middle Of the night...A hotel in the middle of the night can be a magical place...A mouse stopping and running and stopping...A radiator hissing. A sink dripping. A floor creaking. A curtain blowing.There is something peaceful, even comforting, knowing that people you love are asleep in their beds, where nothing can harm them...Elizabeth and I would talk through the night until just before dawn...It was the first time a woman had ever kissed me. It's something you never forget.It took me a long time to go to sleep.She was the first woman who ever loved me.Until one night...And so, I went to war.It wasn't the war we expected. We would tow crippled ships... scraps of metal...across the high seas... If there was a war, we didn't see it...There was a man assigned with us... The Chief Gunner loved the Navy, and most of all, he loved America.His name was Dennis Smith and he was a full blooded Cherokee... His family had been in America for over five hundred years.I worked in the kitchen...We were towing a British freighter, that had gone dead in the water, 800 miles to Halifax for repair...He had given me all of his pay... he hadn't spent a dime of it...The war found us.A transport carrying 900 men had been hit by a torpedo. We were first to arrive at the scene...There wasn't a sound...736 men died that day... I said my goodbyes to the Cherokee, Dennis Smith, John Grimm who was right, he was going to die there... I sent Pleasant Curtis' wife his money... I said goodbye to the twin, Vic Brody...And to Mike Clark... Captain of the tugboat \"Chelsea.\"I said goodbye to all the other men... who had dreams of their own... All the men who wanted to be plumbers or singers or insurance salesmen or doctors... or lawyers or Indian chiefs.Out here, death didn't seem normal....I'd never seen a hummingbird that far out to sea before...In the spring of 1945.... when I was 26 years old... I went home...It's a funny thing about coming home. Smells the same. Looks the same. Feels the same.You realize what's changed, is you...And one evening, not long after I had been back...When I had left she was a girl... and a woman had taken her place...\"...Everything, in that moment, had changed between us...\"And she told me about this world that she was so attracted to... names that didn't mean a thing to me...I didn't really hear very much of what she was saying.You only get so many chances to be with someone... I let her go... and I missed it...I didn't need glasses anymore...My hair had very little gray and grew like weeds...My sense of smell was keener... my hearing more acute... I could walk further and faster...While everybody else was aging... I was getting younger... all alone...I told him about my life... about my time at war... and he told me how he had devoted his business to making buttons for the war effort...You can be mad as a mad dog at the way things went...You can swear, curse the fates, regret everything you ever did... but when it comes to the end... You have to let go...I buried him in the Button family plot.I had a tailor sew onto his best coat -- a button for every year of his life....fifty-five of them... all different, pearl and silver, brass and wood... in case he lost one along the way...I went to pay a visit to the button factory.And I went to New York.And I met her friends...I'd find myself saying... Goodnight, Daisy.If you want you could say I was looking for something...Life went on as usual.Until one day...Sometimes we are on a collision course and we just don't know it... Whether it's by accident or by design, there's not a thing we can do about it...A woman in Paris was on her way to go shopping...But she had forgotten her coat... and went back to get it... And when she had gotten her coat the phone had rung... and so she had stopped to answer it... and talked for a couple of minutes...And while the woman was on the phone; Daisy was rehearsing for that evening's performance at the Paris Opera House...And while she was rehearsing... the woman, off the phone now... had gone outside... to get a taxi...Now a taxi driver... had dropped off a fare earlier... and had stopped to get a cup of coffee...And all the while Daisy was rehearsing...And the cab driver who had dropped off the earlier fare, and had stopped to get the cup of coffee...had picked up the lady, who was going shopping... who had missed getting the earlier cab...The taxi had to stop for a man crossing the street who had left for work five minutes later than he normally did... because he forgot to set his alarm......While the man, late for work, was crossing the street... making the cab wait... Daisy, finished rehearsing, was taking a shower....While Daisy was showering; the taxi was waiting outside a Boutique for the woman to pick up a package... which hadn't been wrapped yet because the girl who was supposed to wrap it... had broken up with her boyfriend the night before and forgot to...When the package was done being wrapped... The woman, who was back in the cab... the taxi was blocked by a delivery truck...All the while Daisy was getting dressed...The Delivery truck pulled off and the taxi was able to go...While Daisy, the first to be dressed, waited for one of her friends who had broken a shoelace...Daisy and her friend came out of the theater...And if only one thing had happened differently... if only the shoelace hadn't broken......Or the delivery truck had moved moments earlier......Or the package had been wrapped and ready... because the girl hadn't broken up with her boyfriend......Or the man had set his alarm and got up five minutes earlier....Or the taxi driver hadn't stopped for a cup of coffee......Or the woman had remembered her coat......And had gotten into an earlier cab...Daisy and her friend would have crossed the street......and the taxi would have driven by them...But life being what it is... a series of intersecting lives and incidents... Out of anyone's control... the taxi did not go by... and the driver momentarily was distracted...And he didn't see Daisy crossing the street......and that taxi hit Daisy...And her leg was crushed...Her leg had been broken in five places.... and with therapy, and time, she might be able to stand...maybe even walk...\"I stayed in Paris for awhile, just to look out for her...\"I learned to sail on an old boat of my father's from the Lake House...I can't lie, I did enjoy the company of a woman or two......Or maybe three...And in the spring of 1962...She came back.I asked her to come with me...And you said...And I said...We buried her beside her beloved Mr. Weathers...And we bought a house of our own...We had no furniture to speak of... we would have picnics in the living room...We slept on a mattress...We vowed never to go to bed or wake up at the same time. We lived on that mattress...Our neighbor, Mrs. Van Dam was a physical therapist...We lived four blocks from a public pool...And I think, right there and then, she realized none of us is perfect forever.She opened a dance studio...\"She was happier than I had ever seen her...\"On a day like any other in the spring...She gave birth to a five pound four ounce baby girl...It was your first birthday. We had a party... the house was filled with people...The fathers and mothers were there...I sold the summer house on Lake Pontchartrain... I sold my share of Button's Buttons... I sold the sailboat... I put it all into an account for your mother... And before you would ever remember me...I left, so that you and your mother could have a life.I left with just the clothes on my back.\"...What I think is, it's never too late...or, in my case, too early, to be whoever you want to be...There's no time limit, start anytime you want...change or stay the same...there aren't any rules...We can make the best or worst of it...I hope you make the best...I hope you see things that startle you. Feel things you never felt before. I hope you meet people who have a different point of view. I hope you challenge yourself. I hope you stumble, and pick yourself up. I hope you live the life you wanted to...and if you haven't, I hope you start all over again.\"\"That night...\"I watched her go...Until she went out of sight...I'm the only one who isn't sleeping...\"I figured out one thing. If you're growing older or getting younger it really doesn't make any difference. Whichever way you're going you have to make the most of what this is.\"\"Along the way you bump into people who make a dent on your life... Some people... get struck by lightning...\"\"Some are born to sit by a river.\"\"Some have an ear for music...\"\"Some are artists...\"\"Some swim the English Channel...\"\"Some know buttons...\"\"Some know Shakespeare...\"\"Some are mothers...\"And some people can dance...\"", "clean_line": "war end wars ended told especially good night born gave life forever grateful home know

Would you like to get something to eat?I'm enjoying listening...I didn't know you smoked...Yes you are...Which part?People should want to sleep with you... You're very desirable...It's not that I don't want to... I just can't... not tonight....Its just not...Go back to New York, Daisy... Be with the people you are so fond of... You can only be young once...Of course, Mr. Button... What happened to you?You're still drinking Sazerac with whiskey instead of brandy.Are you still visiting the house on Bourbon street?I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Button.I'll do what I can, Mr. Button.Just what holds my shirt on.It's all very interesting. But what do you want from me?Our family?My mother?Why didn't you tell me?I better go.Home.Thomas...His wife.My name is Benjamin, Benjamin... Button...As you know, my father......My father, Thomas Button... recently passed...He asked that I take over the day to day operation of Button's Buttons.Well, I don't know the first thing about buttons...and I don't know a thing about business...Button's Buttons has been in my father's family for over 100 years. It could not have survived without people like you. My father asked me to tell you how much he appreciated the hard work you put in for him and his company for so many years.I have decided that all of you -- his loyal employees, will have a share, depending on your length of employment, in the ownership of this factory, his legacy.That's about it.Mrs. Sanderson will explain how everything works and will answer any of your questions...I'm a friend of Daisy's...I thought I'd come visit... spend some time with you if I could...I couldn't take my eyes off of you... you were mesmerizing...Somebody told me about a restaurant I thought you might enjoy... I made a reservation... Just in case --Something like that.I came here to tell you I made a mistake before...A day doesn't go by that I don't regret it...It's not the way I felt...I should have never let you go...I came because I hoped I could be with you...Do you love him?Okay. Okay... I'll see you in New Orleans...That would be me....Hello, Daisy...Your friend wired me.You would have done the same for me...I'll get a room... and once you can leave you'll come home with me to New Orleans. Where you can be with people who love you.Alright, I'll stay here in Paris... I'll help you with anything you need...You'll change your mind.No. I don't care where you've been -- I'm just happy you're back.I don't want to ruin it...Goodnight.Are you sure?Relationships have a time and a place.What I mean is... You don't usually get more than one chance. If you miss it, it's too late... and it's gone... We're lucky... we had more than one chance.Have you ever had a Sazerac with whiskey not brandy?Bet you can't.I love your wrinkles.I don't know... I'm always looking out of my own eyes...Will you still love me when I have pimples. When I think it's funny to make fart noises...Will you still love me when I think all girls have cooties... Will you still love me when I wet my bed at night... Will you still love me when I'm afraid of things that aren't real...Nothing lasts...I've never seen anything not come to an end...Goodnight, Daisy...Queenie came to tell me she loved me... and that my mother was gone.Hello... Queenie... we're back...Queenie...? Mama?Hello... Anybody here?It's Benjamin, Mrs. Carter... Where is everybody?We are meant to lose the people we love. It's how we know how important they are to us.They come with the house...You're crying...You chose something to do... something so special... so unique... there was such a short period of time that you could do it... Even if nothing had happened ... Sooner or later you would be in the same place you are now...You're still beautiful to watch...We finally caught up to each other...Stay just like that... I want to remember what we look like right now.I'm not hiding it.What if it has...what if its like me?...I want to be father... not a little brother... I don't want to be picked up from elementary school by my kid... I don't want anyone babysitting me...You know, there's nothing I wouldn't do for you...Yes.Get me an ambulance... My wife is seven months pregnant and fell on the stairs...You're sure there's nothing wrong with her?Don't eat sand...She's going to have a really attractive diaper.I think you should find a real father for her...She needs someone to grow old with...She needs a father not a playmate.You don't need another child to raise...I want you to know I love you...I wanted to see you both.Hello...She's so lovely... she looks like you...
