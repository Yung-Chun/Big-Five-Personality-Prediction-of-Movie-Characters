{"Confidence": {"JAKE": {"raw_line": "And I think it's because of this redhead...The Anti-Christ?Gee... What makes you say that?Just the last three weeks.I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.I had to! That motherfucker was about to welch! You saw what he was doing, right? You heard him! Lionel starts shaking his head spastically.Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes. In the distance, A POLICE SIREN WAILS, growing louder.LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me! Jake takes a tentative step forward. Lionel sees a BLOOD STAIN on Jake's shirt and recoils. The SIREN GROWS LOUDER, Jake turning his head towards it.Help me. Jake waves Lionel back through the door they came out of. CUT TO: INT. - THE EUCLID BAR A dive furnished with a few mismatched chairs and a bar. A single overweight PATRON sits at a corner table with face buried in his hands as he WHIMPERS. Jake and, Lionel Dolby pass him as they emerge from a back hallway. MILES, late 20's, wipes blood off the bar. Placed at the edge of the bar are two briefcases, both open, both filled with neat stacks of blood splattered money. A DEAD GUY lies face down on the floor in a pool of blood. Jake grabs the Dead Guy's legs as Lionel watches in disbelief.Come on. Grab his arms. Lionel stands frozen. Jake, drops the dead guy's legs with a THUD.Lionel... He's dead. Yeah, maybe you didn't pull the trigger, but you were standing right there and watched me do it. Help me. Grab his arms. The POLICE SIRENS grow LOUDER.If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.Then shut up.Relax, porkchop. The POLICE SIRENS sound like they're right outside.Then go. Lionel looks at the briefcases of bloodied money.What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now? Lionel again looks at the briefcases; then the shotgun leveled at Jake; then at the direction of the POLICE SIRENS... He runs for the door without a second thought. CUT T0:Stop waving that thing around.And you know I hate guns. Jake tosses the revolver on the bar.I told you, use less powder.Then these go into your cut. Big Al moves over to the bar.Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do. We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?What? I can feel you looking at me.Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.Ten percent.Confidence. It's just confidence. Sobozinski and Rottovich head for the door with their newly padded pockets.What are you talking about? Ten's standard.We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.Isn't it always? CUT TO: INT.- FOUR SEASONS HOTEL- NIGHT A suite in the upscale hotel. Miles answers a KNOCK on the door-- An expensive CALL GIRL stands at the door in an overcoat.It's what makes us run. And despite what they say, it can buy you love.It can buy you a new and better you.It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.It can make you think you're on top of the world. Jake passes a group of well-dressed, well manicured people waiting in line outside of a trendy bar called \"Wax.\" Among the hip and well dressed, he seems out of place at the moment. An outsider. An attractive blonde in her late twenties, LILY, bumps into Jake.And if you believe that money can do all that for you, you're the perfect mark. Jack Kerouac said that if you own a rug, you own too much. I don't necessarily like Kerouac and driving cross country isn't exactly my idea of a good time, but the guy's got a point... Jake sits alone with his crossword puzzle. CUT TO: INT.- JAKE'S APARTMENT- LATER Jake enters a sparsely furnished loft. The skyline of Brooklyn twinkles through dirty, picturesque windows. Jake drops his keys on a table and hits a button on an answering machine.If you've got nothing, you've got nothing to lose. And when it comes to money, finding it and losing it, you always gotta remember how much of it's just luck... Jake stands his sparse little world, addressing the quiet before he fishes for his wallet, which he can't find. LILY Oops.Dumb fucking luck. Jake stares out the window after the bird. CUT T0: INT.- DOLBY'S APARTMENT- NIGHT A nicer apartment than Jake's. Lionel Dolby, the Mark from the Euclid rushes around, haphazardly throwing things into a suitcase. There's a KNOCK on the door that stops Lionel dead in his tracks. Another KNOCK. Lionel still frozen. The door flies open with a BOOM. In the doorway, we see HARLIN, an older mountain of a man dressed in a plain black suit. Behind him is LUPUS , dressed in a sweatsuit a pilot could spot from 20,000ft.Yeah.Miles...Big Al used to send money to his Father, some Vietnam Vet slowly losing his mind in a VA hospital in Cleveland. Al was like that. That's why Al never played the Inside. CUT TO: INT.- DINER- DAY Gordo enters and takes a seat in the back booth with Jake and Miles.Well, this is just fucking great...A bird flew into my house last night. Gordo and Miles exchange a look, unsure of how to respond.He'll find us. We go talk to him.You know what we're doing with the money.Leave him. Someone's going to find him eventually. Then they'll start looking for us, too. A WAITRESS approaches.The Euclid was our place. CUT TO:Gordo fleeced the deed off some idiot in a card game. We used it every now and then for a rag, but mostly it was our office. Our Power Point. Gordo and Miles start unloading the same neat stacks of money from their pockets. It's not as much as Jake put in.That's it?Just mail it to the hospital. Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you. Jake hangs up the phone.Tonight. Just me.Meet me at my place later.I'm getting a ride. Jake picks up the phone and dials another number. CUT TO: EXT.- THE BULLDOG GYM- NIGHT A neon sign in the shape of a boxing glove tells you what kind of gym it is. A police car comes to a stop in front. Rottovich and Sobozinski in the front seats. Jake gets out of the back.I try.You the one that did it? You the one that got Al?Uh... Which one's the King Pin?Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.I have a good crew.Minus one.I guess it lacks a certain style.You can't cheat an honest man.I apologize for the inconvenience. The King picks up a long, metal nail file.I can't do that.Let me rephrase-- I won`t do that.Because you killed one of my crew.I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.No. Just confidence. The King Pin stands up and moves over to Jake.We got caught. So you know it won't happen again. With surprising speed, the King Pin grabs Jake by the neck.Why?I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.Just a tip.You never know when you can use a crooked cop.So you want to know how to play the Big Con.First thing about being on the grift.... You're only as good as your Mark. The Roper's the guy who finds them. Jake buys another round to the indifferent Slick.They all have money one way or another. Some of them come from money. THE SCENE DOESN'T CHANGE--- Slick MORPHS into a FAT TEXAS BUSINESS MAN wearing a ten-gallon hat. He doesn't smile.There's that saying-- Show me an honest man and I'll show you a natural born liar. There's always that little bit of bad no matter how much good. It's that little itch on the back of you neck. You may not even know it's there, but it is. The Fat Texan MORPHS into a WALL STREET-type suit, who remains stoic as Jake reaches over for another round of drinks.A good Roper knows how to scratch it-- You the outdoorsy-type? \"I was just fly fishing out in Montana\". You play the market? \"I just got a tip on a tech start-up IPO.\" You saw \"the 'Riverdance\" twice? \"I had a roommate in college who was gay.\" Whatever... Wall Street MORPHS into a THIN EURO-TRASH man who takes a drink from Jake without even a \"thanks.\"It means that in fifteen minutes we're on good terms. Thirty, I'm your buddy. Euro-Trash MORPHS into an distinguished looking OLDER MAN as he takes a sip.In an hour, I'm your best friend. Jake punctuates some unheard point with a slap on his knee.Give me a day and you'll let me do your wife and daughter at the same time. It's too late for you... Jake looks up as the OLDER MAN MORPHS into LIONEL DOLBY, the nervous mark from the earlier con.I have your confidence. CLOSE-UP: Dolby's lips loosen in a wide SMILE. Jake smiles back. He puts his drink down, then takes the drink from Dolby. They remain talking as THE BACKGROUND--I tell you the \"Tale\"-- It's the story of how we're going to make easy money. No one gets hurt. And here's the guy who's going to help. That's when you meet the Insideman.The Insideman's the one with the know- How, the scoop, the angle. But maybe 'you' re the suspicious type . So I give you the \"Convincer.\" We both put up a little and we get a little back. Just a taste. Gordo pulls an envelope out of his coat and gives it to Dolby.Just enough that when I tell you we can make more off of it, you agree. Jake speaks quickly to Dolby who nods emphatically. He hands the envelope back to Gordo. JAKE That`s when I put you on the \"Send.\" You put in -a little, you got a little. Put in a lot... I \"send\" you out for mare. As much as you can get. CUT TO: INT. - JAKE'S APARTMENT- NIGHT Jake stands TALKING DIRECTLY TO CAMERA, loading a big, black revolver with bullets.Doesn't matter what the con is. Insider trading, a line we got on a bookie club, insurance scam, whatever... You saw the money and you want it. More of it. Who cares if you have to bend the rules a little? As long as no one gets hurt. Jake spins the gun cylinder then SLAPS it closed, pointing it straight at the CAMERA. JAKE Then someone does...Frankie Suits always said, that what you have to understand about any confidence game, is that it's like putting on a play where everyone knows their part... The Roper, the Insideman, the Shills... Everyone except for the Mark. Gordo lying in a pool of blood...Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg. Dolby turns to Jake, eyes wide, lips trembling in fear.You should be running out the door, desperate to forget this ever happened, ready to repent your greedy ways!Then there it is again... That little itch. There's a guy holding a smoking gun, a guy bleeding all over the floor and still, all you can think about is the money. You twisted fuck. So we gotta give you the \"Blow-off\". We make sure that you never, ever want to look for us again. We get you off our backs. Forever. Jake stops for a second and listens... He points over his shoulder and on cue A POLICE SIREN WAILS in the distance.And that's why you need the \"Fix\"... Dolby bolts for the door without the money. CUT TO: EXT.- SIDEWALK- CONTINUOUS Dolby tries to act casual as he walks away. CUT TO: INT. - THE EUCLID BAR- CONTINUOUS Rottovich and Sabozinski enter the front door.The New York Police Department's finest. Half as smart and twice as crooked as the guy they just chased away. CUT TO: EXT - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT Butch eases the gun off Jake's head.Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer. CUT TO: INT.- JAKE'S APARPMENT--NIGHT Empty except for Gordo, Miles, Jake and Lupus, dressed in another of his trademark loud sweatsuits.We're working for the King.No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill.Breasts. CUT TO: INT . - WAX--NIGHT A crowded night... LILY, the attractive blonde from earlier, flirts with a well dressed, OLDER MAN who has his hand firmly planted on her ass. She squeezes his hand and gives him a quick peck on the cheek before walking away. She takes a look at the man's wallet she just lifted before putting it in her bag. From out of nowhere, Jake bumps into her.Oops. Jake takes her by the arm out to... CUT TO: EXT.- ALLEY/OUTSIDE BAR- NIGHT Jake pushes Lily through the back door where she finds Gordo, Miles and Lupus waiting. Her once flirtatious demeanor is replaced by something harder.We're not cops.Yes, her. Where's my wallet?You interested in a little work? Lily scoops up her bag and finds a cigarette, eyeing them all suspiciously.Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me. Lily takes a second to look the guys over. Miles gives her a wink. Lily slowly raises her middle finger at him.We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before? Lily studies Jake's face for any hint of sarcasm. None.You get an equal cut.Just play a part. A little acting. Lily steps back and hails a cab.That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark. CUT TO: INT.- THE EUCLID- DAY Jake stands in front of the crew: Miles, Gordo, Lily and Lupus.Morgan Gillette. Gordo and Miles both do their best to contain their disbelief.Because that's who the King Fin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect... CUT TO: INT.- CITY BANK OF MANHATTAN/BOARDROOM--DAY A circle of BUSINESS MEN sitting at a conference table.His grandfather used to run liquor during prohibition and his father made a bundle in illegal importing and exporting. That makes him a third generation crook.There's a story going around that he helped fund the Contras back in the eighties. Gillette and his crew head through a large glass revolving door to... CUT TO: EXT.- CITY BANK OF MANHATTAN- DAY A busy mid-day New York sidewalk. Gillette heads towards a waiting Town Car.Most of his money's clean. A lot of it isn't. The best part is that we know exactly where it is. As Gillette and his crew disappear into the car, we PAN up to see the front of the building which has a large sign reading, \"City Bank of Manhattan; A Gillette Family Company.\" CUT TO: INT.- THE EUCLID-- RESUMING Jake looks over the crew, who are less than convinced.Two million. Miles lets out a whistle.We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King. Jake looks over at Lupus for confirmation.That's why we don't go after him directly. CUT TO: INT.- CITY BANK OF MANHATTAN/LOBBY Empty. The marble floor spotless, the dark oak teller windows vacant, a row of desks.We find a doable guy in Gillette's bank... Someone about mid-level. Not too high, not too low. A lone man, GRANT ASHBY, MATERIALIZES behind a desk on the empty floor and sits behind a computer terminal.We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.We pay better.Our guy gets us approved for the start up capital. But, the money can't be transferred to any one person. On the given day, the money's wired into a corporate account in an off-shore bank. CUT TO: INT.- GRAND CAYMEN'S BANK- DAY Another empty bank... A lone TELLER MATERIALIZES behind the counter.That same day, I show up in the Caymens with the proper I.D. and corporate papers to make a withdrawal. Jake MATERIALIZES on the empty bank floor, walking confidently up to the Teller with a SILVER BRIEFCASE in hand.What?Good point. Jake approaches the Teller, now wheeling a BLACK SUITCASE behind him by the handle. Jake presents the Teller with a series of papers and a photo I.D.It's bank policy not to release this money in cash because it's under a corporate account.So we cash the check at another bank. Jake slides the suitcase and the check over to the Teller. CUT TO: INT.- JFK AIRPORT/TERMINAL HALLWAY- DAY Like the banks, empty. Jake walks with the suitcase down the flourescent lit hall towards a series of tables under a sign marked \"Customs.\"Now, this is the most important part-- You can't just walk into the United States with a suitcase full of cash without evoking the words \"cavity search\". As we get closer to the Custom's Desk, a CUSTOMS OFFICER wearing a white short sleeve shirt and a badge MATERIALIZES behind it.That's why you need someone on the inside at Customs. Jake approaches and slides the suitcase towards him. The Officer slides it back to Jake, revealing another envelope stuffed with cash under it.Then we disappear. As he walks away, WE SEE some PEOPLE MATERIALIZE carrying luggage... Then a FEW CARS... Then an AIRLINE REP... Gradually more and more people and cars, each MATERIALIZING into a normal scene at the airport until we lose Jake in the crowd. CUT TO: INT.- THE EUCLID- RESUMING Jake stops and gauges the crew for their reactions, which are the same all the way around-- Slack jawed disbelief.It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs.Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.We're getting a little old for running.I'm getting clear of this. If you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. Gordo?No, not \"whatever.\" You're either in or you' re out. A silence falls over everyone.I agreed with Miles. It was, hands down, a dumb fucking idea.But they bought it. Now I had to deliver and I needed help. JAKE Yeah, it's Jake. How'd that tip work out? CUT TO:Factors that weren't clear to me until now. CUT TO: INT. - 16TH PRECINT/OFFICE- DAY An office of empty chairs and desks. Through the windows we can see the hustle and bustle of the precinct. SPECIAL AGENT GUNTHER MOONAN, still dressed in the same shitty suit, sits behind a desk as Rottovich and Sobozinski enter.Let me tell you something about Moonan... CUT TO: EXT. - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT A serious look comes across Jake's face-- Hate. Butch eases back with the gun for a second.He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.Just watch every thing you say around him. Every word, every move... It all goes back to the King Pin. Lupus exits the restroom, heading back towards the booth.Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.I'll worry about Customs.Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something. Jake rolls his eyes as Lily glares at him. CUT TO: INT.- BULLDOG GYM- DAY Boxers at the bags, a jumping rope, etc... Jake and Lily stand in front of the King Pin, who's dressed in shorts and a t-shirt. He wears boxing gloves and headgear. Lupus and Harlin stand vigil by the sparring ring.I think two million.I need you to stake me.I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done. King Pin eyes Jake suspiciously for a second.Nothing ventured, nothing gained.Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here. Lily just shrugs and rolls her eyes.No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you, I'm still running the show. That means I get a little respect. So I don't want to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It's Jake.And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape. A few of the BOXERS training around stop and turn. The King Pin lowers a glare at Jake.Excuse me?Fine. You want me to take it off, I'll take it off. Jake unbuttons his shirt and stands in front of the King Pin, arms crossed. It's getting weird.You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you? The King smiles and begins to take off his shirt. Harlin and Lupus share an uncomfortable glance. The King strips down to the waist and reveals an incredibly large, incredibly round stomach which he SLAPS loudly.No thanks. I'm good.I am not going-- The King starts to get that look again. Jake winds up and punches the King in the stomach. He shakes his fist in pain.I think I just broke my hand.You get all that? Everyone in the gym goes back to their workouts. CUT TO: EXT. - BACK ALLEY Butch lets out an easy laugh.We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank. CUT TO: EXT. - CITY BANK OF NEW YORK DAY A flood of people exit the bank at the end of the day. Jake, Lupus, Lily, Miles and Gordo wait by the side of the building. Miles reads off a piece of paper.What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.Guy like me, with people like that... I'll tell you what you're looking for without even meeting you. It's like a personal ad you wear over your head. Jake watches as she hails a cab. A MAN, also hailing a cab goes for the same one. Michelle gets into a screaming match with the man. FREEZE FRAME ON MICHELLE--- A CGI SIGN appears over her head \"Single, volatile, confrontational woman seeks \"man\" for economic security and house chores.\"No. CUT TO:No. CUT TO: EXT. - CITY BANK OF NEW YORK- NEXT DAY The same flood of people exit the bank... Jake, Lupus, Lily, Miles and Gordo wait by the side of the building.No. CUT TO:What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's got nothing to lose. No friends, no family, no life. You're looking for a guy who doesn't own a rug. Jake watches as Ashby orders a drink and pulls a newspaper from his coat. He opens it to the crossword-- Just like Jake would.Him.I' m sure. CUT TO: INT.- GARMENT DISTRICT/WAREHOUSE- DAY Jake, Miles, Gordo, Lily and Lupus enter a warehouse housing racks of clothes.Now we had the con and the mark. We needed to look the part... They're greeted by FRANKIE SUITS, an ancient rake-thin man, perfectly coiffed and exceptionally dressed.Frankie Suits was a legend in certain circles. He. Was on the grift since he was ten.Back in the day, Suits made money running fight stores and the wire with a Fix so tight it was like a legit business. I never understood what the point was if grifting became like a regular job.We need wardrobe. FRANKIE So I see. In from Long Island? You fellas take a look around.Aces, Suits.Pretty much.Pretty much. Suits eyes Lily.Huh? Oh. She's alright. Suits gives Lily another suspicious look.A little bit of both. Lily watches in utter confusion.Can't say.The King. A dead look comes over Suits.I can handle it.It's not history.I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.Yes I can. Suits guages the seriousness in Jake's face and nods. The he gently rests his hands on the papers.Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.We're Jake. They shake, knowing it'll be the last time. CUT TO: INT.- GARMENT DISTRICT/WAREHOUSE- CONTINUOUS We follow Lily and Jake out of Suit's office. Lily can see that it's thrown Jake a bit.Don't worry about it.You need to get a haircut.And some new clothes.We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.I don't trust anyone.Oh yeah. This is good. This will do nicely. This is about confidence. Your confidence and their confidence. You get their confidence by giving them yours. Jake leaves Lily by the front counter as he starts a slow turn around the store. He casually pretends to be browsing as he moves next to MR. LEWIS, an older, distinguished looking gentleman, being helped by a SALEGIRL, who is scribbling on an order form.Mr. Lewis? Mr. Lewis turns and looks at Jake. There's no real hint of recognition, but Jake's smiling up at him like an old friend.It is you. Hello! Jake extends his hand.Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice. Mr. Lewis seems to search for second, then extends his hand more in an effort not to appear rude.Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.You know, this is kind of embarassing, but my wallet was stolen yesterday and I'm afraid the ticket was in it. But the name's Pearson.My wife and I are just taking a little vacation. Behind his back, Jake discreetly waves Lily over.Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily. Lily and Mr. Lewis exchange handshakes.I'm sorry, honey. I'm almost done. Jake taps Lily on the back with the hand wrapped around her waist.Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?Very much so. Jake smiles ear to ear, like the happy newlywed he's pretending to be. The Salesgirl returns.I told you. My wallet was stolen. Please... Check again. Jake takes a nervous look over at Lily, who is drying on earrings with another Salesperson.Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..?That'd be a great help.You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.A ring for my wife. Alot like that one. In fact, it was that one.Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?I know it's policy, but... The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...This is embarrassing.I'm sorry, sir. Thank you very much for doing this. And please tell Carolyn hello for me. Jake seems to be lost. Mr. Lewis looks over at Lily, who gives him a friendly smile, then back to Jake.Happy anniversary. Lily takes the box and shakes her head, impressed. Jake Looks up to see Mr. Lewis watching them as he tries to hail a cab. Jake's demeanor quickly changes as he puts on a big smile.Smile. You just got a present from the man of your dreams. Lily puts on a big smile while opening the box.Now we gotta give him a strong finish.Uh-huh.Uh-huh. Jake watches as Lily walks away. She looks back at Jake once before disappearing around a corner. CUT TO: INT.- SIXTEENTH PRECINT- DAY Moonan sits on a desk, ear to a phone.It was all in play. Everything...Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all. CUT TO: INT.- JAKE'S APARTMENT- NIGHT Miles, Jake, Lupus and Gordo sit around in silence. They're all dressed in new suits.But if you wanna talk about bad luck...Redheads.Top three all-time worst red-heads... INSERT SHOT- A RED HEADED WOMAN enters dark bedroom, carrying an axe...Lizzie Borden... Axe murder. INSERT SHOT- A dinner table for TWELVE MEN dressed in flowing robes. A RED HEADED MAN leans over to whisper in the ear of an important looking guy in the middle...Judas... Betrayer. INSERT SHOT- A RED HEADED WOMAN, middle-aged with a bad haircut from the 70's carrying a suitcase leans down and tearfully kisses a SMALL BOY on the cheek.Shirley Vig... Abandoner. BACK TO FREEZE FRAME OF LILY The action resumes...You just put a mother of a jinx on us.But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house... Lily takes her jacket off revealing a delicate blouse, decorated with a design of flowers and a BIRD. FREEZE FRAME ON LILY'S BIRD BLOUSE. CUT TO:A bird enters your house... CUT TO: INT.- BIG AL'S APARTMENT Big Al's bulging, vacant eyes stare straight at us, his mouth hanging open.It means death. BACK TO FREEZE FRAME ON LILY'S BIRD BLOUSE. The action resumes...You have no idea what you've done do you? No idea! What is this? Jake points to her hair.What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!Like that matters! You can't fool bad luck! You can't get by on a technicality! You can't trick karma! Lily grabs her jacket and starts out the door, then turns back around to Jake.Anybody says a word I swear to God... Jake takes off after her. CUT TO: EXT. - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT Butch cracks a big smile.My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million. LILY steps out from behind Butch.She's up for it. ANGLE ON ASHBY AT THE BAR Ashby sits finishing a drink. Snippets of CONVERSATION and LAUGHTER from the cliques around him catch his attention, but he remains alone.She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, \"You're fired! Your whole team's fired!\" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo--Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.What do you do over at your bank, Grant?A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.We know exactly how we're going to make The money back. There in lies the Catch-22Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay? Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.Yes. That's why I wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little.Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help. Ashby considers for a moment.Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.Lupus! Lupus turns and Jake moves closer. JAKE When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al.I'11 find the time. Lupus nods and heads off. Jake watches them go.For what? A couple hundred bucks?It's what I do. It's my job.Are you asking me if I have something to prove?Not in that repressed anger sort of way.Good quality porn has it's place in the world.I'm good at it. Lying, cheating. Manipulating... I'm good at it.Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.Intuition. CUT TO: INT.- LILY'S APARTMENT- NIGHT Illuminated only by the light coming from the windows... Jake runs a hand down the length of Lily's bare back. She falls onto him, both of them hitting the bed locked in a deep kiss. Lily's hand moves down Jake's arm until it finds his hand.Don't ruin this for me. They roll off the bed onto the floor, a naked tangle of arms and legs, their hands still entwined. CUT TO: EXT. - BACK ALLEY NIGHT Jake takes a deep breath, Butch and Lily behind him.You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden. Lily looks away, her face softening for a moment.Then she fucked him over with an apple. Redheads... Jake continues to LAUGH... CUT TO:How do you deal with---Maybe. Even if we don't, you'll be alright. You're not in the hole with the King. Lily rolls away from Jake. Undaunted, Jake starts kissing her back.Sounds respectable.You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now? Jake, kissing up the length of Lily's neck.Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.You guys got busted. This is a great neck. Jake still kissing...Glenn talked you out of it.He was looking out for you.Lily... Jesus Christ...Did, uh... Did you kill him?No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.Sorry, honey. But I figure if we can't all share at a time like this... Butch lowers the gun down and looks over at Lily.We had to finalize the deal.This has to happen fast.There'll be red flags. Jake slides an envelope across the desk.You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer. Ashby leafs through the money in the envelope.You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.The standard ten.Two million.And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow. There's a pause before Ashby smiles, then reaches around to scratch his neck. CUT TO: INT.- CITY BANK OF MANHATTAN/HALLWAY- DAY Jake exits Ashby's office with Lupus, Gordo, Miles and Lily. They all follow Jake down the hallway.Eight A.M. flight.We'll use the Euc. They pass the glass partitioned conference room. Jake looks inside to see Morgan Gillette holding court with a bunch of SUITS. Butch stands behind Gillette. For a second, Butch and Jake's eyes meet. CUT TO: EXT.- STREET- DAY Jake, Lily, Miles, Gordo and Lupus... As they move through the crowded sidewalk, Rottovich and Sobozinski appear behind them.That tip not work-out for you fellas?Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business. Sobozinski punches Jake in the stomach. Miles and Gordo lurch forward--Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks.Wouldn't dream of it. Rottovich punches Jake hard in the stomach, sending him GASPING to the ground.Something stupid.We go way back... CUT TO: EXT.- DOG RACETRACK- DAY A BELL... A mechanical rabbit springs forward. Greyhounds bolt out of the gate.About four years ago, we were working in Miami, turf fixing for some local goon. CUT TO:Turns out this local goon was being watched by the Feds, which means we were being watched by the Feds. One in particular. Through the crowd, we catch a glimpse of Moonan, in sunglasses, watching the guys.Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Jake turns and catches Moonan looking at him. CUT TO: EXT.- RACETRACK/PARKING LOT- DAY Moonan walks over to a car.He didn't really have anything on us, but I figure, maybe this guy's good for a Fix. So I ask him out to dinner. Moonan pulls a piece of paper off the windshield that reads: \"La Scala 2night.\" CUT TO: INT.- LA SCALA- NIGHT An elegant restaurant. Jake sits confidently in an expensive suit speaking to the shabbily dressed Moonan across from him.These guys we have now, sure, give them twenty bucks and they'll look the other way on a parking ticket. But a Fed... You get a guy like that as your Fix... Jake nonchalantly slides a fat envelope over to Moonan. Moonan picks it up and finds a wad of cash.It was probably a stupid idea. There I am, Armani and Rolex. There he is, JC Penny and Timex...So I took a shot. But now he had me on attempted bribery of a Federal Agent. As Moonan stands, we see Big Al get up from the next table. A1 \"bumps\" into Gordo, dressed in a waiter's white jacket. Gordo \"trips;\" spilling scalding hot coffee into Moonan's lap. Jake casually gets up and leaves. FREEZE FRAME ON MOONAN'S CONTORTED FACE.That's when Gordo comes in with the Hazelnut French Roast. RESUME-- Moonan falls to the floor, holding his crotch in agony. CUT TO: EXT.- LA SCALA/PARKING LOT- NIGHT Miles pulls up in an old Cadillac, picking up Jake at the entrance. They pick up Gordo and Big Al from a side door and drive off as Moonan limps out of the restaurant, still holding his crotch. CUT TO: INT.- THE EUCLID- DAY Jake finishes the story to Lupus.And that's how Special Agent Gunther Moonan and I became friends. Lupus nods, satisfied.No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up.No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers!Do you even remember Al? Do you remember what he looked like sitting there?Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.There are three people I trust-- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray doq that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over. Lily looks around the room. No one seems to be backing her up.What about what?So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?I'm going to say this one last time for You, so take a deep breath and count to ten. There is no cut. Lily levels a look of utter contempt at Jake.That's it.Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.Of what? They're both crooks.My fucking heart bleeds.Point, Lupus. Give us a point.I was doing it for them.It's not true.No. She won't. She's not going to be a problem. Lupus cups the phone.Uh huh... Uh huh... Okay... I understand. Jake hangs up the phone.Oh, you know... Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll shoot your dog... All the usual. Then he said good luck.Aww, shit! CUT TO: EXT. BACK ALLEY- NIGHT With a shrug, Jake continues...We were back on.She walked. Lily pushes Butch aside and moves closer to Jake.Sorry. I didn't know...Today? Started off great... CUT TO: EXT.-- CAYMEN ISLANDS/BEACH- DAY Crystal blue water gently rolls onto virgin white sand. A jet cuts a line across the cloudless sky...Ashby was going to call us with the exact time of the transfer. The King was waiting on us. Just to be safe... CUT TO: INT.- JET- SAME Gordo sits in first class, impeccably dressed in a Brooks Brothers suit. JAKE (V . O . Gordo went down to the Caymens instead of me. I needed Rottovich and Sobozinski to keep Moonan off our backs and the only way I could do that was to stay in town and cut them in on the deal. CUT T0: INT.- 16TH PRECINT- SAME Rottovich and Sobozinski sit around the desks, as Moonan reads the newpaper behind them.So they waited for my call while Miles and I waited for Ashby's call. CUT T0: INT.- THE EUCLID- SAME Jake sits with Miles and Lupus at a table in the otherwise empty bar.Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny-- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.And we got rid of the red head.Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.In order to ensure that we weren't going to welch, Ashby's pay-off was to be directly deposited into his own offshore account which he could confirm electronically. In this age of ecommerce, paper currency has become \" more of a liability than a commodity. Especially to us.Go. CUT TO: EXT.- CAYMEN ISLANDS/CAFE- SAME Gordo listens into a cell phone: Without saying a word, he gets up, wheeling a nondescript BLACK SUITCASE. Across the street sits the Grand Caymen's Bank in all it's pastel and brass glory.

Gordo stands in front of a Teller. She reads off a paper then does a double take at Gordo, who smiles back. JAKE They check the papers... Gordo slides a folder of corporate papers along with his photo ID towards the Teller. We follow the teller as she hands the papers to the...They stick. Gordo shakes the Loan Officer's hand and calmly walks towards the door. CUT TO: EXT.- LAYMEN ISLANDS/STREET DAY Gordo walks across the street with the suitcase and pulls a cell phone from his pocket.Then he had to bang it out across the street at the Bank of the Caymens...We called them Green Twinkies. The Bank Official and Security Guard exit. Gordo holds up a Green Twinkie up to his nose and takes a deep breath. CUT TO: EXT.- CAYMEN ISLANDS/STREET- DAY The Security Guard holds open the door as Gordo exits, suitcase in tow. Gordo takes his cell phone out as he moves across the street.Miles was on his way to the airport to wait for Gordo to land. I made the call.Yeah, it's me. I need an escort. Not a ride, just an escort. You wanted in, this is in. CUT TO: INT.- 16TH PRECINCT/DETECTIVES' OFFICE- DAY Sobozinski behind a desk. Sitting in a chair leafing through a magazine is Moonan. Rottovich on the phone...Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.Gordo. CUT TO: INT.- JET- SAME Gordo on the Air-Phone next to MRS. HEAVYSET...What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane! Gordo eyes Mr. & Mrs. Heavyset.He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?That was fucking deep. Lupus gets up and heads for the bathroom again. CUT TO: INT.- TOWN CAR- SAME A CELL PHONE RINGS with a digitized version of \"Ode to Joy\". The King answers it.What's up with you? Bladder infection?It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it.

CUT TO: INT.- MORGAN GILLETTE'S OFFICE- NIGHT MORGAN GILLETTE sits behind a desk in an ultra modern office, his reptilian like face fixed straight ahead. Butch leans against the wall behind him.This is probably about where you came in.Eww-Whoa? CUT TO: EXT.- JFK AIRPORT/PARKING LOT- SAME Miles on a cell phone...Eee Oott Auught!HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched! Lupus picks up the phone and dials another number... No answer.Aaaaiiit!!! Ooopusss!! Lupus takes a newspaper off the bar and covers Jake's face with it. SLAM!!!-- Blood splatters across the front page of the Metro Section. The paper falls away revealing Jake, wide- eyed, the gun hanging from his mouth. Lupus lies in a heap at the floor.I never thanked you for that. CUT TO: EXT. BACK ALLEY- NIGHT Jake runs his tongue across the front of his teeth.What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right?Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government. Butch buttons his coat.It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.Guess so.I do trust you, Lily.

One Federal Agent pulls the black suitcase out of the car. JAKE But maybe I can't blame Lily. Maybe I just should have just trusted her to play her part. Because playing the big con is like putting on a play. A play where everyone knows their part except for the Mark... CUT TO: INT.- DINER Jake sits with Lily, Miles and Gordo crammed into a booth.Just watch everything you say around him. Every word, every move... It all goes back to the King Pin. Get it?

Jake points to her hair. Lupus quietly watches, taking it all in... CUT TO: INT.-- THE EUCLID- DAY Jake and Lily squaring off...You tell them the \"Tale\".What do you want? An apology?And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head...Then you give them the \"Blow-off\". You get them off your back. Forever. The King Pin and Harlin are bent over the hood handcuffed. Rottovich and Sobozinski lie on the ground, face down, their hands behind their heads.But most of all, you need the \"Fix\". This time, Moonan TAKES IT. CUT TO: INT.- THE EUCLID Jake finishing the Moonan story...That's how Special Agent Gunther Moonan and I became friends.Like Suits said, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. The Custom Officer waves Gordo through. Gordo reaches down and picks up an IDENTICAL BLACK suitcase already lying on the table next to his and leaves.Rottovich and Sobozinski would ask how the drugs got in that suitcase. The King and Gillette would ask where the money really went. Moonan walks over to the Customs Desk and takes the original black suitcase. He nods to the Customs Officer. Moonan turns and walks TOWARDS CAMERA, wheeling the suitcase behind him.And all of them would ask what agency Special Agent Gunther Moonan worked for. We CLOSE-IN ON THE BADGE hanging from Moonan's neck. On it is a number and the single word, \"CUSTOMS\". CUT TO: EXT.

mess.My place.Oh please... Miles non-chalantly pulls a sawed off shot gun frown under the bar. MILES You think this kinda shit hasn't happened here before? Given it's usually on Thursdays. And usually, I gotta tell the cops, \"No, Officer... I didn't really get a good look at the shooters.\" Usually anyway.You sure we're clear?You guys were late. We had to go to a Mexican stand-off.Keeping the city streets safe for drug dealers and pedophiles everywhere. Jake starts taking the money out of the briefcases. Gordo strips out of the jacket and shirt, revealing a THIN WHITE VEST. A wire runs from a battery pack on his belt, up the center of the vest, ending at a scorched, bloody, explosive squib. Gordo drops the vest along with a plastic bag containing fake blood. A nasty bruise on his chest marks the spot where the squib was.It's clean. Gordo disappears dawn the back hallway.Twenty? My ass!Cops... CUT TO: EXT. BACK ALLEY- NIGHT Butch shaking his head, still holding the gun.You better get over to Al's. Now.I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti-Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got.Sorry. I'm just... Look what they did to him. Right in the middle of his egg- foo-young. Big Al stares up at them with those bulging, vacant eyes, his mouth hanging open. Jake reaches down and grabs the remote control and turns the TV off.Who's that?What's a King Pin? Gordo looks to Jake, but can see that he's still processing the information.So what? We hide, right?You're pissed we didn't get credit?We sure Big Al threw him to us?Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...We're going to give him the money back?Coffee. And a valium. Jake turns his attention out the window. CUT TO: EXT. - THE EUCLID-- DAY A basement bar in a crummy neighborhood. There's no sign, but everything about it says, \"Condemned.\"Fuck that. We're going too.How do you know the King's going to let you walk?You better hurry. The police will be here any second. I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?Wait a second... Who's the mope?So we gotta short con our way out of a hundred and fifty grand? That could only take like, a year.What do we need another Shill for?Is it just me or is there something really hot about a girl telling you to go fuck yourself? Gordo gives Jake a nod of approval and Jake takes off after Lily. CUT TO:Why?I'm with Jack LaLane. That guy's untouchable.This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...We never had a problem with that before.What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on `til the next local putz caught on.Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I' m not like \"twenty-five to life\" pissed.Am I the only one who feels like we can't make a move with this guy on us?He doesn't like using a bathroom unless he knows it's clean.Is it all fugasi?Michelle Strigo. Loan officer. Miles points out a woman crisply dressed in a suit, MICHELLE STRIGO. They follow her down the street.Jay Houlser. VP International finance. Miles points out a JAY HOUSLER, a young guy in suit. They follow him... CUT TO: INT.- TRENDY RESTAURANT- NIGHT Jake and the others watch Jay standing around the bar silently scoping the place with a group of young tucks . FREEZE, FRAME ON GROUP-- A CGI SIGN appears over their heads: \"YOUNG WALL STREETERS seek acknowledgement of monetary earning potential from Supermodel-types ages 20- 25.\"Alice Tanner. Finance Director. Miles points out ALICE TANNER, a mousy looking woman in a bad skirt. She gets to the intersection and waits for the light to change, even as hordes of others jaywalk the way New Yorkers do. FREEZE FRAME ON ALICE-- A CGI SIGN appears: \"Single woman looking for opportunity. Plays by the rules and willing to claw her way up to middle management.\"Grant Ashby. VP of Corporate Loans. Miles points out a GRANT ASHBY, a schlubish middle aged balding guy walking down the street. They follow. CUT TO: INT.- THE BULL AND THE BEAR PUB- NIGHT Dark oak and brass, the bar plays host to legions of Suited Urban Professionals gathered in cliques. Jake and the others watch as Ashby makes his way through the crowd, taking a seat alone at the bar. FREEZE FRAME ON ASHBY-- A CGI SIGN appears over his head: \"SINGLE MALE seeks end to safety of tedious and solitary lifestyle. Moral and ethical constitution flexible.\"You sure? Jake watches Ashby do the crossword puzzle alone.Where the hell is she? Just then, a KNOCK on the door. Jake opens the door to reveal Lily, dressed in an expensive business suit and sporting a sophisticated cut of new RED HAIRIt's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine! More LAUGHS.Wow. We haven't met with anyone your level yet. VP? So that means there's you, then the P.I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?What do we do? We change the scam?Escorts!He should be landing in the Caymens about now. The Custom's guy is ready right? Jake stares off into space, absentmindedly flipping a penny in his hand.And we got rid of the red head. Jake considers...Jake? Customs? Jake just nods and continues flipping the penny. JAKE They say a good chess player can. See up to twenty moves deep. That means that in some games, you've calculated every possible move in your head... The game's over before it's even \" really started. CUT T0: INT.- CITY BANK OF MANHATTAN/ASHBY'S OFFICE- SAME Ashby sits at a desk, computer terminal in front of him. He speaks in hushed tones on the phone.Jake! I don't know what's going on! The King Pin... He's here and he just got pinched. I think with the twinkies! It looks like half the police department's down here! In the BACKGROUND, a whirlwind of activity-- Red and blue flashing lights, half of the police department, Federal Agents in blue windbreakers...

Jake removes the blood stained bills from the top of the pile.That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop?I just don't know if this says, \"me\". What's the fabric? CUT TO: INT.- BIG AL'S APARTMENT- NIGHT Big Al has a cordless phone to his ear...Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just pulled him out of the East River.It gets worse. Now I know why he was such a good rope. X mean, cash.... That much and we never had to put him on the \"Send?\" Turns out this ducking Moe was an accountant for the King Pin. Gordo throws Jake a hard look, letting the news sink in. Jake can only slump back into the booth.The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. `Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says \"boo.\"Currently, the King Pin is a very large- type pole stuck up our asses.Independant. Same shit, just independant. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do?No, that was the only semi-fucking smart thing he said! Except anybody that's ever met Big A1 knows that the only thing he's comfortable doing alone is eating. This guys tells this guy, that guy tells some other guy, eventually it works it's way back to someone who works for the King and--Shazaam. Big Al's eyes grow huge as we hear a LOUD BALM!!!Come on... All three of them turn their attention out the window. They watch the bustle of people walking past wondering if any one of them is looking back.Whoa. What?And what about Big Al?When?Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do? Jake levels a stare at Gordo for a second.I've been shot. Oh. The humanity. Big Al sits cowering at a table...You gotta be kidding me. Her?How much we going after?We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.How's that? He works for Gillette.People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.Yeah... Whatever, Jake.How's the hoop, superstar? Clean?You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease-Hey Suits? You got anything in like a eleven or twelve ounce Super 100 worsted? Miles gives him a look like he's speaking latin. Jake and Lily follow Suits into... CUT TO:Oh shit.The red hair... It's bad luck.She up for this?So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says \"The code's fine, the program's for shit\" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk! They all break out into LAUGHTER.I haven't been able to use a public bathroom since.Masters of our own destiny.That's that Gillette guy, right? You Like him? As a boss, I mean.Come on...Jake...Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.Let's go, Jake?You sure? Jake looks over at. Lily then nods. Gordo, Miles and Lupus start to head off.We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.You'll be there?Calls?Moonan. Here. Shit...Jake--Jake, I mean, come on--So that's it...First and ten.I'd like this cashed, please. ANOTHER TELLER looks at the check then back up at Gordo. GORDO I also need to deduct a certain amount and deposit it into this account number. Gordo takes another piece of paper and slides it to the Teller. CUT TO: INT.- CITY BANK OF MANHATTAN/ASHBY'S OFFICE- DAY Ashby sits, nervously tapping his computer monitor with a pen. MARIE, a secretary, pokes her head in.We got Twinkies. Gordo pockets the phone and disappears into the crowd. CUT TO: INT.-- THE EUCLID- SAME Jake hangs up the phone and dials another number. He nods at Lupus.I'm landing in about fifteen minutes. MR.

She throws Jake a smile he can't but help return. They stand for a second facing each other before she's whisked away by an OLDER MAN, dressed in an expensive suit.What is this? You guys cops or something?Your what? Jake takes her bag and dumps the contents on the floor-- A few wallets, a watch, even a wedding ring. Jake picks up one of the wallets filled with cash. LILY That's not--Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a waxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy. Jake.Says who?Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going? Lily saunters to Jake with a seductive grin. Jake may be aware that he's stopped breathing. She puts her hands on Jake's chest and leans in a half inch more, her lips an eyelash away from his. She whispers... LILY Keep the wallet. We're even. Take a deep breath... Count to ten... And go fuck yourself. Lily pushes past Jake and heads out of the alley.Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off. Jake catches up and blocks Lily's way.Here's my deal-- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.No. What's my cut?What do I have to do?Make a wish. She points to a large digital clock hanging in a store window reading \"11:11p\".Eleven-eleven. If you're superstitious, make a wish.I'm in. Her eyes stay on Jake as a smile grows across her face. CUT TO: EXT.- PAY PHONE- DAY Jake dials a number...We should ditch him.Manly.What about Customs?Hey, I' m not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.Mr . King, I think---You guys are freaking me out.What the hell's his problem?It's just that I left my asshole decoder ring at home, so how do I know not to worry? Jake stops and turns to her, looking her up and down.What?Why?You're just going to have to trust me.Then show me how. CUT TO: INT. - TIFFANY'S - NIGHT Jake and Lily enter the store. Jake takes a quick moment to case the place-- A few scattered CUSTOMERS, some being helped by SALESPEOPLE. All the Customers look like the uppercrust crowd you'd expect at Tiffany's.Uh... Everything okay?It's okay. I'll be looking for earrings. Jake gives Lily another kiss before she leaves.He's gone.I gotta go get a haircut.Nice to see you too. Why are you getting so bent? She takes a step into the apartment.Lighten up.You told me to change my hair!Did I miss something?So much for that good feeling, huh? Silence. Jake can feel the eyes on him.Guess he passed on that unlucky- asshole gene. Lily looks down at Jake and the gun pointed at his head. There's not even a hint of sympathy.You should have trusted me Jake. CUT TO: INT.- THE BULL AND THE BEAR PUB- NIGHT Jake turns and looks at the crew, Miles, Gordo, Lupus and Lily behind him. Grant Ashby sits alone at the crowded bar, doing his crossword puzzle. Jake a smile and saunters over to the bar.Sorry I'm late. Lily appears next to the Blonde. Ashby looks around to make sure she's talking to him.But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.No problem. The blonde woman leaves as Lily sits down next to Ashby.Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn. They shake, Ashby's demeanor brightening again.It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here. The drinks arrive. Lily hands the bartender a twenty.On me. For the seat. Cheers. She flashes a trademark smile as they CLINK glasses.So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say \"no\" without ever using the word.Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.Really? Wish we had met eight hours ago. Ashby nods and shyly looks away. He could be blushing. Lily lets the moment play out for a beat before looking over her shoulder.My partners are here. Ashby reverts back to schlub mode.You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us. Ashby brightens again. CUT TO: INT.- THE BULL AND THE BEAR PUB/TABLE- LATER Ashby sits with the crew, a few empty glasses in front of him. He looks remarkably relaxed, just another guy hanging around with a group of friends.So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys. She throws Ashby a flirty smile.We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...I' m going homeLook at you... You want to go.I think you'd do it for free. You' re almost drooling. You like the rush.Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?Do you have something to prove?I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?It's more than that.So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?How do you know I will?You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.Do you think we can do it? Jake resumes kissing Lily's neck, trying to rekindle some of last night's magic.Who says you have to know the King to be in a whole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper.Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober.I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him. What the hell was his name?Sort of. I was telling him about this great love of my life who's name I don't remember, and I could see... He was getting pissed. I thought it was just because he was worried about me, but...Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off. He said he was going to \"fuck some sense into me.\" Jake stops kissing Lily and looks up at her.Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.After Glenn was finished, he gave me a couple of valiums and I went home. The next day, I finished my shift and met him around back, like we always did. I stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest. Three or four times. Jake slides off Lily.I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way. Jake considers for a second.You know why I told you that, Jake? Because I trust you too.I can take care of myself. Butch freezes as A POLICE SIREN WAILS in the BACKGROUND, growing CLOSER then FADING again. He puts the gun back to Jake's head.People don't like you much, do they? Jake lets out a pained GROAN as they help him up. CUT TO: INT.- CAR- DAY Rottovich and Sobozinski get in the front of a squad car. In the back, Moonan sits reading the Travel section of the NY Times.So what? We just stay clear of him. Jake gets up, hard enough to knock the chair over.Jesus... Take it easy.That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!You are such a raving pussy sometimes.Everyone's working an angle, right?What about...What about the money? Jake stops and levels a look at Lily.No, I want my cut!You're an asshole. With that, she grabs her coat and leaves. Lupus sits quietly, taking it all in.I walked? Let me tell you a story, asshole... CUT TO: INT.- LILY'S APARTMENT- NIGHT Lily stands at a hot plate in her \"kitchen\" frying an egg. HEAVY FOOTSTEPS from the hall catch her attention, growing louder, then stopping at her door. A KNOCK.Jake? Hold on. I just got out of the shower. More KNOCKING.Uh, right now?No problem. She grabs the smoking pan from the stove and WHACKS Harlin across the head. The burned egg lands on the floor. Lily watches as he sways and teeters on his feet, like a drunk. She raises the pan again... But before she delivers the final blow, Harlin steps on the egg, causing his leg to shoot out from under him. He lands flat on his back, out cold. The wood floor CREAKS with his weight. Lily wipes the blood from her nose and turns the hot plate off. CUT TO: EXT. - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT Jake, Butch and Lily...Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you.You got my cell. Leave a message.Only if--? No way. I want something for this.Can we please all stop being so goddamnfucking-polite and get to the point?You sold me out. You should have trusted me like I trusted you.
