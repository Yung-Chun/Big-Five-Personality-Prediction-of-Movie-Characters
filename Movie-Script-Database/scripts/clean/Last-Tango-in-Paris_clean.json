{"Last-Tango-in-Paris": {"PAUL": {"raw_line": "FUCKING GOD!!!!Through the door.I was already here.The armchair should go in front of the window.I don't know.Hello -- Hello. There's no-one here. There's no-one. I don't know. He puts the SMALL LAMP SHADE back. He hangs the receiver on the back of the chaise. Jeanne continues to listen on her end, UNAWARE.I had already decided. But I'm not sure now. Do you like it?Think fast.Ah... Oh, God.Oh, Jesus... Oh... Oh, Christ.Oh, God.Turn the tap off now.Why won't you turn the tap off?It's not mine.The armchair goes in front of the window.Like that.I don't care about the key. Take your coat off.Take your coat off and help me.Get those chairs and bring them here.Put them on the other side. Take that, too. That's it.The bed is too big for the room.I don't have a name.No, no! I don't. I don't want to know your name.You don't have a name and I don't have a name either. Not one name. She THROWS HIS HAND off and puts some space between them.Maybe I am, but I don't want to know anything about you. I don't wanna know where you live or where you come from. I wanna know nothing, nothing, nothing...You and I are gonna meet here without knowing anything that goes on outside here.OK?Because... Because we don't need names here. Don't you see? We're gonna forget... everything that we knew. Every... All the people,... all that we do,... wherever we live. We're going to forget that, everything, everything.I don't know. Are you scared?I expected you later.What are you looking for?Nothing. I told you, there's nothing, nothing at all.It's useless to keep on searching.You need to rest. I think room 12 is free.I don't know. In the evening.Then I... I already told you on the phone... When I found her, I called the ambulance.In one of the rooms.Ask the Doctors. They're doing the autopsy.The cards, clothes, relatives, flowers. You've got everything in that suitcase. You didn't forget anything. But I don't want any priests here.No priests.Understand?No!!!Rosa didn't believe! Nobody believes in the fucking God here!The priest doesn't want any suicides. The Church doesn't want any suicides, do they?Heh!?Why? Why did she commit suicide? Why?You don't know? You don't know.OOh... Now... Let's... Let's just look at each other.Come without touching? OK.Are you concentrating? Did you come yet?I didn't either yet. You're not trying hard enough.A name? Oh, Jesus Christ! Oh, God, I've been called by a million names all my life. I don't want a name. I'm better off with a grunt or a groan for a name. Do you wanna hear my name?Yeah.I didn't get the last name.All uniforms are bullshit. Everything outside this place is bullshit. Besides, I don't want to hear about your stories, about your past, and all that.Or 68 or 28 or 98...Listen, why don't you stop talking about things that don't matter here? What the hell's the difference?Come on the good ship... Lollipop...I don't know. Bad memories, I guess.Oh... My father was a... a drunk. Tough. Whore-fucker, bar-fighter. Super-masculine. And he was tough. My mother was very... Very poetic. And also a drunk. And... one of my memories, when I was a kid, was of her being arrested nude. We lived in this small town. Farming community. We lived on a farm. And I'd come home after school and she'd be gone. In jail... or something. And... I used to... I used to have to milk a cow every morning and every night and I liked that. I remember...One time I was all dressed up to go out and take this girl to a basketball game. And I started to go out and my father said, \"You have to milk the cow.\" I said, \"Would you please milk it for me?\" And he said, \"No, get your ass out there.\" So I went out and I was in a hurry and didn't have time to change my shoes. And I had cow shit all over my shoes. And on the way to the basketball game, it smelled in the car. I don't know. I-I can't remember very many good things.Yeah. Some. There was a farmer, a very nice guy. Old guy, very poor, and worked real hard. I used to work in a ditch, draining land for farming. And he wore overalls and he smoked a clay pipe. Half the time he wouldn't put tobacco in it. And I hated the work. It was hot and dirty and... it broke my back. And... all day long I'd watch his spit which would run down the pipe stem and hang on the bowl of the pipe. And I used to make bets with myself on when it was going to fall off. And I always lost. I never saw it fall off. I'd just look around and it'd be gone and then the new one would be there. And then we had a beautiful... My mother... My mother taught me to love nature. And... I guess that was the most she could do. And... we had... In front of our house we had this big field... meadow. It was a mustard field in the summer and we had a big black dog named Dutchy. And she used to hunt for rabbits in that field but she couldn't see them. So she'd have to leap up in this mustard field and look around very quickly to see where the rabbits were. And it was... very beautiful. And she never caught the rabbits.Oh really?You think I was telling you the truth?Maybe... Maybe...The better to squeeze a fart out of you!The better to scratch your ass with.The better to let your crabs hide in.The better to... to stick in your rear, my dear.That's your happiness and my... my ha-penis.Schlong. Wienerwurst. Cazzo. Bitte. Prick! Joint!Did you have fun as a kid?It's beautiful to be made into a tattletale or forced to admire authority or sell yourself for a piece of candy.No?Did you ever think about sex?\"No. No sex.\"You were probably in love with your teacher.And she was a lesbian.That's classical... Anyway...No! I'm gonna get a hemorrhoid if you keep telling me names. No names. I don't mind if you tell the truth, but don't give me the names.Well, go on. Tell the truth. What else?You mean when he first got into your knickers.I'll bet he was... Probably getting his kicks.Oh, yeah. Good excuse. What else?You started grabbing his joint.Well, he touched you.Ohhhh. Liar, liar, pants on fire, nose as long as a telephone wire.Look me straight in the face and say, \"He didn't touch me once.\" Huh?Aha! The way he did it. OK, what did he do?When did you first come? How old were you?I came to this hotel a long time ago, to spend one night. And I stayed for five years.Now, there's all sorts. They can hide, take drugs, play music.Take your hand away.Do you want me to make them shut up? OK. I'll make them shut up.What's the matter, Mother? Are you upset? Don't be. There's nothing to be upset about. It takes so little to make them afraid. I'll tell you what they're afraid of.They're afraid of the dark. Imagine that! Come on, Mother. Meet my friends.You should meet a few clients of the hotel. Hey, folks. I'd like you to say hello to Mom. Mom, this is Mr Juicehead Junky here. And... Mr Saxophone, he's... He's our connection, Mom. He gives us some hard stuff once in a while. And right here is the beautiful Miss Blowjob of 1933. She still makes a few points when she takes her teeth out.Say hello, Mom! This is Mom! Oh! You afraid of the dark, Mom? She's afraid of the dark. Oh, poor thing. All right, sweetheart. I'll take care of you. I'll give you a little light. I'll give you a little light. Don't you worry about a thing.Good evening, Marcel.Do you like him? He was Rosa's lover.Well... Let's say we're just taking a flying... a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut.I think you're a what? A what? A wore?You mean whore.No, you're just a good old fashioned girl... trying to get along.Why were you going through my pockets?To find out OOH you are.Well, if you look real close, you'll see me hiding behind my zipper.That's not a beginning, that's a finish.I'll be 93 this weekend.Thank you.Oh yeah. Yeah. I went to... the University of Congo. Studied whale- fucking.Are you telling me that I look like a barber?That's a barber's razor.Or a madmans. He starts SHAVING his neck with the STRAIGHT RAZOR.No. That would be like writing my name on your face.Slaves are branded on the ass and I want you free.Oh, really?Well,... either they always pretend to know who I am or they pretend I don't know who they are and that's very boring.NO! I... Jesus Christ! Where is your brain? State zitta. Halt's Maul, Schweinehund. Shut up. Get it?I know it's tough but you're gonna have to bear it.You know, these sinks are really beautiful. They're very rare, you don't find them any more. I think it's these sinks that let you stay together.Hmm? Don't you think?What's that? What's all this?Mad?Mad? Mad? Mad?I think I'm happy with you.You wanted to talk to me. Go on, then. You know I haven't come to cry with you?Our bathrobes? You can't tell me anything I don't already know.Yes, yes, yes.Your meticulous. I've always wondered why you save newspaper clippings. Is it work? Or a hobby?Oh, so it's serious. It's a job that makes you read? Very educational.Marcello...Marcello, I know everything.Would you like a shot of bourbon?Was that a present from Rosa, too?Together?Your mistress...Our room is painted white. Rosa wanted it to be different from the other rooms in the hotel.To make it look like... a more normal home. But... it had to be changed here, too. I think she started with the wall.You're lucky huh? You were... You must have been very handsome 20 years ago.You've still got all your hair.Don't you have massages?You're in good shape.What do you do for... your stomach? That's my problem.Tell me!Ah...You can't believe that Rosa... killed herself. It's hard for me to... believe, too.Really, Marcello, I wonder what she ever saw in you. CUT TO:Go get the butter.Go get the butter.Yeah. That's a hiding place.Why not?What about that? Can I open that?Huh? Wait a minute. Maybe there's jewels in it.Maybe there's gold.Are you afraid?No?You're always afraid.Family secrets?I'll tell you about family secrets.I'm gonna tell you about the family.That holy institution meant to breed virtue in savages.I want you to repeat it after me. He MOUNTS HER, opening his ZIPPER. She STRUGGLES more.Repeat it. Say, \"Holy family.\" Come on, say it.Go on. Holy family. Church of good citizens.Good citizens.Say it. Say it! The children are tortured until they tell their first lie.Where the will is broken by repression.Where freedom.....is assassinated. Freedom is assassinated by egotism. Family...You... You... You... You f... You... fucking... fucking... family. You fucking... family! Oh, God... Jesus. Oh, you... Oh...Huh?What?That's good. I like surprises.What is it?Do you enjoy that?Voil\u00e0!Oh, there once was a man And he had an old sow ow! Hi-diddle- dow...You're wet.What the hell?A rat. Only a rat.There are more rats in Paris than people. Yum, yum, yum.Wait, wait! Don't you want a bite first? You don't want to run and eat.No, this is the end......but I like to start with the head. That's the best part. Are you sure you won't have any? OK.What's the matter? You don't dig rat?Well, we'll fuck on the radiator or standing on the mantel.Listen, I gotta get some mayonnaise for this. Because, it really is good with mayonnaise.I'll save the asshole for you.Quo vadis, baby?Oh, isn't that wonderful? You know, you're going to have to get out of these wet duds.Well, first you have to take a hot bath. Cos if you don't......you're gonna get pneumonia, right? Huh?And then you know what happens? You get pneumonia, then you know what happens? You die. And then, you know what happens when you die? I get to fuck the dead rat!Give me the soap. She does.You're in love?How delightful.Fat, is it? How unkind.In ten years, you'll be playing soccer with your tits.What do you think of that? You know what I'm gonna be doing?Well, maybe. But, you know... I'll be smirking and giggling all the way to eternity.OK. oblesse oblige.Oh, really? That's wonderful. Is he a good fucker?You know, you're a jerk. Cos the best fucking you're gonna get is right here in this apartment. Stand up.Give me the soap. Listen, you dumb dodo. All the mysteries that you're ever gonna know in life are right here.You mean, like everybody.What is he, your local pimp?I can't wait.You want this man you love to protect and take care of you.You want this golden, shining, powerful warrior to build a fortress where you can hide in. So you don't have to ever... have... You don't ever have to be afraid. You don't have to feel lonely or empty. That's what you want, isn't it?Well, you'll never find it.Then it won't be long until he'll want you to build a fortress for him out of your tits and out of your cunt and your hair and your smile and the way you smell. And... and some place where he can feel comfortable and secure enough so that he can worship in front of the altar of his own prick.No, you're alone. You're all alone. You won't be free of that feeling of being alone until you look death right in the face. I mean, that sounds like bullshit, some romantic crap, until you go right up into the ass of death. Right up in his ass... till you find the womb of fear. And then,... maybe... Maybe then, you'll be able to find him.Get me the scissors.Get me the fingernail scissors.No. I want you to cut the fingernails on your right hand, these two. She DOES.I want you to put your fingers up my ass.Put your fingers up my ass, are you deaf? Go on. I'm gonna get a pig... and I'm... I'm gonna have the pig fuck you.I want the pig to vomit in your face and I want you to swallow the vomit. Are you gonna do that for me?Huh?I want the pig to die while... while you're fucking him. Then you'll have to go behind him. I want you to smell the dying farts of the pig. Are you gonna do all of that for me?You look ridiculous in that make- up. Like the caricature of a whore. A little touch of Mommy in the night. Fake Ophelia drowned in the bathtub. I wish you could see yourself. You'd really laugh. You're your mother's masterpiece.Oh Christ! There are too many fucking flowers in this place. I can't breathe. You know on the top of the closet?The cardboard box, I found all your... I found all your little goodies. Pens, keychains, foreign money, French ticklers, the whole shot. Even a clergyman's collar. I didn't know you collected all those little knick-knacks left behind. Even if the husband lives fucking years, he's never going to be able to discover his wife's real nature. I mean, I... I might be able to comprehend the universe, but... 'll never discover the truth bout you. Never. I mean, who the hell were you? Remember that day, the first day I was there? I knew that I couldn't get into your pants unless I said... What did I say? Oh, yeah. \"May I have my bill, please? I have to leave.\" Remember? Last night... I ripped off the lights on your mother. And the whole joint went bananas. All your... guests... as you used to call them... Well, I guess that includes me, doesn't it? It does include me, doesn't it? For five years, I was more a guest in this fucking flophouse than a husband. With privileges, of course. And then, to help me understand you, you let me inherit Marcel. The husband's double, whose room was the double of ours. And you know what? I didn't even have the guts to ask him. Didn't have the guts to ask him if the same numbers you and I did were the same numbers you did with him. Our marriage was nothing more than a foxhole for you. And all it took for you to get out was a -cent razor and a tub full of water. You cheap, goddamn, fucking, godforsaken whore. I hope you rot in hell. You're worse than the dirtiest street pig anybody could find, and you know why? You know why? Because you lied. You lied to me and I trusted you. You lied. You knew you were lying! Go on, tell me you didn't lie. Haven't you got anything to say about that? You can think up something, can't you?Go on, tell me something! Smile, you cunt!Go on, tell me... Tell me something sweet. Smile at me and say I just misunderstood. Go on, tell me. You pig-fucker! You goddamn, fucking, pig-fucking liar. Rosa, I'm sorry... I just can't... I can't stand it... to see these goddamn things on your face. You never wore make-up. This fucking shit. I'm gonna take this off your mouth. This lipstick... Rosa... Oh, God!I'm sorry. I don't know why you did it. I'd do it too, if I knew how. I just don't know how. I have to... I have to find a way.What?All right, I'm... I'm coming. I have to go. I have to go, sweetheart, baby. Somebody's calling me.Yeah. I'm coming.It's four in the morning.We're full.I'm very sorry.Come. Come with me.Get the fuck out of here!Faggot!It's me again.It's over, then it begins again.There's nothing to understand. We left the apartment. Now we begin again with love and all the rest of it.Yeah, listen.I'm 45. I'm a widower. I've got a little hotel, a kind of a dump. But it's not completely a flophouse. And... I used to live on my luck, and I got married. My wife killed herself.I'm awfully sorry to intrude but I was so struck with your beauty that I thought I could offer you a glass of champagne. Is this seat taken?May I?Garcon!You know, the tango is a, is a rite. Do you understand \"rite\"? And you must watch the legs of the dancers.Oh, no! You haven't drunk your champagne because it was warm. And then I ordered you a Scotch and you haven't drunk your Scotch.Come on. Just a sip for Daddy.Now, if you love me, you'll drink all of it.Bravo!Let's talk about us.Yes, but I'm here, aren't I?That's rather nasty. Anyway, you dummy, I love you. And I want to live with you.In my flophouse. What the hell does that mean? What the hell difference does it make if I have a flophouse or a hotel or a castle? I love you. What the fuck difference does it make?!Oh, I thought you weren't drinking.All right. I think that's a good idea.Wait a minute. Because you're really beautiful. Wait a minute. I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to spill my drink.No! Fuck all that! Come on. No. Hey, listen. Let's drink a toast to our life in the country. Huh?Oh, for Chr... I'm a nature boy. Can't you see me with the cows and the chicken shit all over me?Cows.And listen... I get to milk you twice a day. How about that?What do you mean you hate the country?No. Let's dance. Come on. Don't you wanna dance? We can start again.Madame! 'Tis ever love.Oh my god, I've never...Kiss me, sweetheart!Farewell, you sweet peach blossom.I could dance for ever. Oh, my hemorrhoid!Beauty of mine, sit before me. Let me peruse you and remember you always like this.Garcon! Champagne! If music be the food of love, play on.What's the matter with you?What's the matter with you?What's finished?That's ridiculous.That's ridiculous!Oh, you dirty rat!Look, when something's finished, it begins again.Oh, Jesus. Listen, that's not a subway strap, that's me cock!Oh... Jesus...Wait a minute... You dumb bimbo...Shit! Wait a minute. Goddamn it! Hey!Hey, rube! Come here! Come here! He SLIDES DOWN THE BANISTER.Come heeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrreeeeee!I'm gonna get you! Bimbo!Hold it!Hey, cool it!I can't win. Give me a break!Aha! I smell the henhouse.Well, shit, I'm not in your way.After you, mademoiselle!So long, sister. Besides, you're a crummy-looking broad. I don't give a damn if I never see you again. Shit.Oh, fuck the police.Listen, I want to talk to you for Christ sake...Oh, man! She MAKES A DASH FOR her moms apartment.This is getting ridiculous.It's the title shot, baby. We're going all the way. Oh, Christ.It's a little old, but full of memories, huh?Mademoiselle...How do you like your hero?

Yes, it's Jeanne. I've found a flat to rent in Passy. I'm going to see it.Then I've got to go to the station to met Tom. I promised him. OK, see you later. Bye!I've come to see the flat. I saw the sign.Yes.I'd like to see it.I don't know yet!Let go of me!She's crazy!Who are you?You gave me a fright.How did you get in?Oh yes, I left it open. I didn't hear you come in.Sorry? Oh it was you who took it. I had to bribe the concierge. These old houses are fascinating.An armchair by the fireplace would look good.Are you American? You've got an American accent.Are you going to take it? Are you?What are you doing?Oh la la. Should I answer It or not? Oh...So you're going to take it? You've decided?I don't know. I shall have to think about it.I thought you'd left.Have they taken us for someone else?What's going on? Do you know them?You're mad! You might have asked me first.So you kissed me, and you knew it was being filmed. You're a bastard! Traitor!I thought of you day and night, and I cried. Darling, I can't live without you!You could have rung the bell.In front of the fireplace.There.How do I know? He'll decide.It won't fit!What a mess!But I only came to return the key. To return it to you.OK.You didn't waste any time...Listen monsieur! I've got to go.Look, sir! I've got to go!I don't know what to call you.Do you want to know mine?You're crazy!You scare me.But why?But I can't. Can you?No.Come? CUT TO:It's beautiful without knowing anything.Maybe... Maybe we can come without touching.No. It's difficult!I shall have to invent a name for you.It's so masculine.Listen to mine.It's not a wig, it's my hair.I'm in a hurry. Let's start.Tonight we improvise. You follow.He was my childhood friend. He used to watch me for hours and hours. I think he understood me.Meet Olympia, my nanny.Olympia, open the front door.Go and open it. Olympia is a compendium of domestic virtues. Faithful, admiring, and racist.That's me there. And that's Mademoiselle Sauvage, the teacher. She was very strict... and very religious.That's Christine......my best friend. She married the pharmacist and has two children. It's like a village here. We all know each other.We're safe here. It's odd looking at the past.What are you doing?Papa?In full uniform.Papa in Algeria.My favorite route when I was eight.My old notebook.French homework. Theme: the countryside. Exposition: the countryside is cow country. The cow is all dressed in leather. The cow has four sides: the front, the back, the top and the bottom. Isn't that good?Here are my cultural sources. Le Grand Larousse.I just copied from it. Menstruation. Noun. Physiological function comprising the discharge of menses. Penis. Noun. Male copulation organ, measuring five to forty centimeters. That's Le Petit Robert.Tom! Tom! Tom! Look!My first love.My cousin Paul. My first love.What?He played the piano divinely. That's how I remember him...Aren't my trees beautiful? They were my jungle.What are you doing?Shame on you, doing it in my jungle!Did you get it?Olympia was great. It'll give a good idea of race relations in the suburbs of Paris.I thought we'd finished.I'm meeting someone for work.The colonel had green eyes and shiny boots. I worshipped him. He was so handsome in his uniform.What?What? Don't...He died in Algeria in 58...58, and don't joke about things like that.OK.So what do I have to say? What do I have to do!?Of what?You have been had!I don't wanna know anything about your past, baby!I'm a Red Riding Hood and you're the wolf.What strong arms you have!What long nails you have!Oh, what a lot of fur you have!Ooh, what a long tongue you have!What's this for?Peanuts?It's funny. It's like playing grown- ups when you're little. I feel like a child again here.It's the most beautiful thing.I wasn't like that.I was writing poems. I was drawing castles,... big castles with tower. A lot of tower.No. No sex.Tower.My teacher was a woman.How did you know?My first love was my cousin Paul.Sorry. Sorry.I was ... He was dark, very thin. I can see him. Big nose! A big romance. I fell in love with him when I heard him playing piano.He was a child prodigy. He was playing with both hands.We were dying of heat.In the afternoon, when the grown- ups were napping...You're crazy!I never let him! Never!No, I'm not.He touched me, but the way he did it.Behind the house, there were two trees. A plane tree and a chestnut. I sat under the plane tree and he sat under the chestnut. And one, two, three... We each began to masturbate. The first who came... won!Why aren't you listening to me?The first time? I was really late for school. I started running and it was downhill. All of a sudden, I felt a strong sensation here. So I ran and ran and I came as I ran. The faster I ran, the better it was and the more I came. A couple of days later, I tried to do it again, but no luck.Why aren't you listening to me?Why do I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall when I talk to you? Your solitude weighs on me. It isn't indulgent. It isn't generous. You are selfish!I can be by myself, too, you know!What am I doing in this apartment with you? Love?So you think I'm a wore.A wore.Yes, a whore. Whore.I prefer to be a whore.To find out OOH you are.Yes.Well, we know that he buys clothes in some big store. That's not much. But it's a beginning.Well, OK. Let's forget it. How old are you?Oh, you don't look it.Have you been in college?Wow!Barbers don't usually go to university.No, but that's a razor's barber.Barber's razors, yes.So you want to cut me up?Like they do to slaves?Free?! I'm not free! You want to know why...why you don't want to know anything about me? Because you hate women.What the hell have they ever done to you?I'm not afraid to say who I am. I am 20 years old...Again! Do it again! Again!Shall we leave together?Bastard! He's a git! Not even goodbye!Tom!Wait! I've got to talk to you.You must find someone else.For your film.Because you're taking advantage of me! Because you make me do things I've never done! Because you're taking up my time! You make me do whatever you want! The film is over!I'm tired of being raped!Are you in?Is anyone here?Hi, monster.Is something wrong?So you're here? Why didn't you answer?I have to hurry. I have a cab waiting.It makes me crazy!That you're so damned sure that I'm coming back here.Do you really think that an American sitting on the floor in an empty flat eating cheese and drinking water is interesting?There's something under here. Can you hear it? It's hollow. Can you hear it? It's hollow.Don't open it!I don't know. Don't open it.No.No, but... maybe there is some family secrets inside.What are you doing?No and no! No!Church...Good citizens...The children... are tortured...Where the will... broken... repression.Free... Freedom!Family...Hey, you!Yes, you!I've got a surprise for you.I've got a surprise for you!Music. But I don't know how to work it.Because you're angry, or you want to be alone with me?You have something really serious to tell me.Is it happy or sad?So it's happy. What sort of secret?Is it dirty or is it about love?A secret about love, but which isn't love. What is it?!What?What?!You're marrying me?We're getting married?No.No!Yes?No.Yes?I don't know.Yes!Yes!No.Olympia will be happy. I went there yesterday with Tom.She's preparing a family museum.When I was little, it seemed really heavy when Papa taught me how to shoot.You don't even know how to use it.You really kept everything of Papa's.Who's that? His orderly?Oh.Don't worry. You'll soon have all the space you want.Nothing.Madame, the colonel's lady, I announce...On this solemn day...I'm getting married in a week!To Tom! In a week!Tom! In a week!Marriage?I see it everywhere. All the time.On walls. On buildings.Yes, on advertising hoardings.No. They're all about young couples. Before marriage, no children. Then the same couple, married with children. In short, marriage. The perfect, ideal, successful marriage. It's no longer the preserve of the Church. The husband was burdened with responsibilities and the wife nagged. Now, weddings in advertising smile!On posters, of course. But why t take poster marriage seriously? Marriage... Pop marriage!Then you have to fix it like you would a car. The spouses are two workers in overalls bending over an engine to fix it.In that case, there are three or four workers.No. That's not. Love isn't pop.The workers retire to a secret flat, take off their overalls and become men and women again and make love.It's the dress that makes the bride.Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne!Forgive me! I wanted to leave you and I couldn't. I wanted to leave you and I couldn't. I can't. I can't leave you, do you understand?Do you still want me?I want to go!This is the end!I wanna go! I can't make love in this bed any more. I can't. It's disgusting! Nauseating!I want to get out of here. I want to go. I can't stand it here any more. Yes. I'm going.I'm not coming back... ever.I forgot to tell you something. I fell in love with somebody.I'm going to make love with him!I'm in love.I'm in love! I'm in love, you understand?I'm in love, I'm in love!Oh! I'm in love!You know, you're old! You're getting fat.Half of your hair is out and the other half is almost white.You will be on a... wheelchair!How poetic. But please, before you go, wash my feet.You know, he and I, we make love.Magnificent.He is full of mysteries.He is like everybody but... at the same time he's different.Yeah, but... even he fright me. Even he frightens me.He could be. He looks it. You know why I'm in love with him?Because he know. He know how to make me fall in love with him.Yeah.Yes.But I find this man.But I find this man!But I find this man. He's you! You are that man!What?That's it.What?Yeah.Yeah!Yes, and more than that! And worse! And worse than before.No!Try and remember! The man from the fourth floor. He moved in a few days ago.Where did they take the furniture too? It's empty. Where do you send his mail? Give me his address.Not even his name?I've found a flat for us. 1 rue Jules Verne. Yes. In Passy. Come quickly! You'll come now? Do you know where it is? I'll wait for you. Come over.Come in, it's open.Do you like our flat? It's very light. There's a tiny room, too. It's too small for a double bed. It would be fine for a child. Fidel. That's a nice name for a boy. Fidel, as in Castro.I'm here!Stop it! Don't start!By chance.Everything! We'll change chance to destiny.What's happening?Adults? That's awful!What do adults do?Yes......Yes, yes. Yes, yes.Where are you going?What kind of flat?We can live here.No, no. I've got to close the windows and return the key. There's a lot to do.Bye.It's over. It's over.What begins again? I don't understand anything any more.The rest?No.If you'd like to.OK, I love you.Tell me about your wife.OK. But this place is so pitiful.Monsieur Maitre d'H\u00f4tel.In your flophouse?Give me some more whisky.But I'm thirsty now and I want some more drink.Let's have a toast to our life in the hotel.You're a nature lover? You didn't tell me that.Oh, yeah. To the house of the cows.I will be your cow, too.I hate the country.I hate it! I prefer to go to the hotel. Come on, let's go...It's finished.It's finished!We're never going to see each other again. Never!It's not a joke.It's finished.I'm getting married! I'm going away. It's finished.It's finished!Stop! Stop!It's over!Stop it! We're finished. He still tries to GRAB HER PURSE. She is ADAMANT.Go away! Go away! Go away!Let go! Go away!I'll call the police!It's over! It's over!It's over!Help!Help! Help!Please, help!Help! Help!Help! Help me! Help!Jeanne...I don't know who he is. He followed me in the street. He tried to rape me. He's a lunatic. I don't know what he's called.
