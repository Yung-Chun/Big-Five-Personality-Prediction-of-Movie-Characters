{"Case-39": {"EMILY": {"raw_line": "And what you learned from your father now Diego's learning from you...?That really upsets you, doesn't it?A whole week without skipping school? Is that true?That's the last time I make a bet with you. See you guys next week.You cut your hair. It looks great.No one is trying to steal your child, they found bruises and cigarette burns -- Mrs Lynch, I read the medical report -- well, if you feel you need legal representation that's perfectly within your rights...Thirty-eight.No, absolutely not, look at this, Wayne, look, I'm buried --Don't fight. Hey, that's his.Be honest. The whole psychology thing, it's just about scoring chicks, isn't it?You know what freaks me out?I sit there talking to these families, you know, like I'm some expert. My family's a train wreck. I mean, I had this moment today where I realized I might be totally full of it.Hey Becca...No, it's me, it's just been a crazy couple weeks. You remember Doug.I'm sure I would, I just...If it were anyone, it'd be you.What are they doing to you?Emily Jennings. Child Services? We spoke on the phone...?Today is the seventeenth.I'm sorry, but it is.Friday was the fourteenth, that makes today the seventeenth. Monday the seventeenth. The date of our appointment.Come down, I'd like to meet you.My name's Emily. What's yours?Pretty name. Pretty girl.Is there somewhere we can talk?When do you expect your husband back?Because we've found it's more beneficial if the whole family participates.Do you have any way of contacting him?Is that...?Would you ask him to join us?Would you ask him?It'll be okay.Hi, I'm Emily --I'm here today because Lucy's school is concerned about changes they're seeing in her academic performance. The kinds of changes they're seeing are often associated with family problems.That's just it, many times a family won't even know they're having problems until it's too late. That's where we come in. We help families communicate and learn healthier ways of resolving conflict.Mr Sheridan, is there some reason you won't speak to me directly?Is there some reason why your husband won't speak to me directly?I didn't say weird, I said scary. The guy sat there the entire time staring at me, the mother is like his emotional slave.Wayne, this girl's in trouble. I can feel it.Every time I talk to you you sound more like a lawyer, you know that?You put these files in front of me and you ask me to tell you what's going on. Well, I'm telling you, there's something going on and it's not something good. I've done my job, I've told you, what you do with it is yours.Tell me, Mr Sheridan, since you've suddenly acquired the power of speech, doesn't it concern you a little that Lucy's grades have gone from A's to D's in three months?So you have no idea why she's falling asleep at school every day? Why she's not able to sleep at home?He's gonna be having bad dreams when he gets hit with child endangerment. Don't tell me you're buying this daddy's little girl routine?A little? Let me talk to her. Alone. She wants to talk.Five minutes. Talk to them about how much they love kids.I knew someone at school named Lucy, she was a writer. Do you ever write? I do sometimes, it helps me sort out how I'm feeling.Okay, I just shot like a gallon of water up my nose. So much for establishing trust.What's happening to you? I can help. Let me help.What is it, sweetheart?I'm sure they don't hate you.What do they talk about?You've heard them say that?It's okay. You can tell him. He's on our side.She doesn't trust anybody. You think I made it up?I'm not giving up on her, Wayne.I hope you can live with a dead child on your conscience.So that's it? We let kids get killed until they rewrite the goddamn laws?Surprise, surprise.Mike, I'm desperate here.This girl heard her parents say they're going to send her to hell.The system is broken.What? Jesus, I feel like I'm talking to Wayne. You don't want to get involved, fine, but don't bullshit me, I'm running out of people I respect.Lucy.I just wanted you to know I haven't forgotten about you. I'm doing everything I can.You're not going to disappear.Lucy, wait...If anything happens, call me, okay? Just press this. Don't let your parents know you have it.I'm gonna get you out of there, I promise.It's me, thought you might be up, um, anyway, call if you get this.Too late, I met someone else...Lucy? Are you okay?Why? Why are you scared, honey?Why are you sorry?Okay, listen, I want you to go over and open the window. Can you do that? Lucy...?Lucy, no, wake up!Lucy...?!Mike, it's Emily, listen, that girl I told you about, I think she's in trouble - - yeah, I know what you said, but -- Mike, you're not listening -- HELP ME!Saving her life!They're not asleep.Did you hear that?Leave her alone!Did you hear that?!Break it down!BREAK IT DOWN!LUCY?!Oh my God...I gotcha... I gotcha... I gotcha...Steal a pizza, San Quentin, try killing your kid, Freudian dream analysis.Did they or did they not know what they were doing? That's the legal standard. They knew, they knew damn well!Meaning what exactly?Oh, that's great - what is this, late- night cable?Yeah, I'm okay. How's she doing?Group therapy for kids, what's that say about the world?Good news. You get to leave here tomorrow.Only for a few days, till we find a better place.Oh, sweetheart. That would never be allowed.It's complicated, there's a whole process, I'm not even a foster parent...I'm sorry.Nothing?Hey, are you hungry? Let's get some lunch. What kind of food do you like?I can't, Lucy, it wouldn't work, I live in this tiny house, I... I'm sorry, I'm not mom material...I know what it feels like to be that age and be unwanted. It's terrifying. She needs to be with someone she trusts; she trusts me. So much of our time is spent negotiating red tape, I think if we just look at the situation - this one situation, this one child - it's clear what's best for her.I like to think of it as a glass-half- full situation. Kitchen. Bathroom. Fish. And here, is your room...Be okay?My family... well, I've met my dad twice and my mom's not a part of my life anymore.Sometimes people have kids and then decide they don't want to be parents.I'm glad you're here.Chamomile, when I get stressed out it helps me sleep.None of this ever should have happened, if I could make it go away I would.I'm right down the hall if you need me.I have to grab some of her things, might take me a minute.I went by the house. I think her mom and dad were barricading themselves in their room at night. How sick is that?I'm coming around.Okay?This is your new beginning.I love you, too.Got it.What's up with Diego?Tell me what's going on.What happened?An eight-year-old did this? There's no way.Where is he now?You want to know what happened?I don't. I need to talk to him. Mike, please, I care about this kid.Diego...Let me in. He won't hurt me.What happened? Tell me what happened.It's just work. Don't worry.My job? I don't know, I guess... I guess maybe I want to believe families can work, so I can have my own someday, I don't know - does that make sense?Breakfast.Honey, breakfa--Come on, let me see...You went through my things?She used to just leave, she'd just... ...and I never knew when she was coming back, or if she was... I used to think it was my fault and I would try so hard when she got home to be good, do everything I could think of, so she'd think I was `special' and stay next time or take me with her, but... it didn't matter, she'd always go away again, that's how it was.Gone, he left before I was born. First time I met him I was like thirteen.Oh, I had all these things I was gonna say. Angry things I'd thought of and kind of memorized. And um.... And then I met him and I wasn't angry, I was just sad and I told him... I said, I love you, even if you don't love me.No... No, I'm not mad at you. But I need you not to do that again, okay? Go through my private things without asking?Omelet's getting cold. Better hurry.You mean, to make sure I haven't missed anything else?She's not going back there, I'll take her out of state before I let them near her again.You wanted to talk about something?From who?What...?That's impossible. I might have called the week before...?Did you not hear me? I'm telling you, Mike, as a friend, I did not call that family.My backup files are in your room. Diego's is in there. Maybe you got curious and went through some, dialed a number?Mike, she said no. Maybe someone made a mistake.I believe you.Give me back my cases or fire me. Right now.I don't care if it's a hairline fracture, he broke her arm, I don't want him back in that house. He what? He found Christ? When? That recently? Uh huh. Well he should have found Him sooner.What's up?How's it look?Do I have to beg or are you gonna tell me what's going on?She's `abnormally normal'?Why would she do that?No, I know, I just... The Martinezes' got a call Thursday night. From my house.She said she didn't. Mike thinks she's lying.I don't know what to think.Got you an extra in case it gets cold.I need to ask you something... about the night it happened... did you get a call, really late?You didn't?Diego, I know you did, they called from my house.What's the matter? What's scaring you?Oh God...It's okay... slow breaths... you'll be okay... Can somebody help us down here?!Who called you? Was it Lucy?Did she say something to you? Something that scared you?`El' dijo? What do you mean, `He said'?It was a man?Well, photocopying isn't much fun.What...?This is weird. Diego said it was Lucy that called, but he called her a he, he said it was a man.Like what?What do I do with her in the meantime?No. Just tired.That's okay.Some other time.I said no, thank you.No. Doug? He says you're doing great.Nothing.Get some rest.Goodnight.I love you, too.See you next week.Did you try calling him?Cover my desk.Doug, it's me, it's Emily...Doug?Doug, you here?NOOOOO!!!!!Dr Johannsen?You did the autopsy on Doug Winters?How did he die?Friend. I know the rules -- please, he meant a lot to me.You're saying he did that to himself?Oh come on. He looked like he'd been beaten to death! Don't tell me he was some - some suicidal... ...I knew him! He was my best friend!Have you ever seen this before, somebody dying like this?It was an accident. It was nobody's fault.He was scared. He came out of that room with her, Mike, and he was scared. He said she threatened him.Diego said it was a man on the phone. You know who made that call. There was no one else in the house. You think I don't know how crazy this sounds?!Why is he in that state of mind? Why was Doug? Pull my phone records. See if she called him.Her mother and father, their bedroom door has these deadbolts on it, big ones, two of `em... Something came through that door and they didn't want it ever coming through there again.Okay.I know I'm probably the last person you want to see right now, but you're...You're the only one I can talk to. Lucy's been staying with me -A friend.I, ummm...What is she?Done with me how?Why me? I don't have anything.What does she want?What should I do?Nancy...?Do you have a minute?Actually, that's why I'm here. I appreciate what you did for me, Nancy, I really do, but I think it'd be best if she was placed in foster care.I know, but it's not working out.I suppose not.Until when?How long is that going to take?I don't want her anymore. I'm done. That's it.How do I make it work if it's not working?Thanks.Hi.Sorry, work - lost track of time.Lucky.Oh, it wasn't working...Who?How - how would I know that?I never said that.I don't care, Robin, anywhere. Just find somewhere that will take her. Tonight. I don't want this girl in my house.Mike.`No such thing as a bad kid, only bad parents.' I always believed that. It's a lie. Her parents aren't crazy.Aren't you?Why did she lie about calling him?Mike, you know I'm not crazy. Don't run away from something just because it scares you.I don't want her in group anymore, I don't want her around the other kids.You're never going back there.W-w-what's happening - ?!You're never going back there!No...Mrs Lynch, I told you - will you let - that's not what I said - no, I did not - you never sent me the - Mrs Lynch - will you let me respond? - will you let me - Mrs Lynch - will you let -SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU MISERABLE MISERABLE WOMAN BEFORE I GET IN MY CAR AND COME OVER THERE AND BEAT YOUR ASS LIKE YOU BEAT YOUR SON! I HAVE YOUR ADDRESS! THINK ABOUT THAT NEXT TIME YOU CALL AND SWEAR AT ME! I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE!I don't want to go home.I know I haven't been a great friend lately, but... do you think maybe I could crash here for a couple of nights?Tonight and tomorrow.LEAVE ME ALONE!!!Help me! Please!Let me on!She's coming! Please!Drive!DRIVE!I... I had some things to catch up on...I saw a doctor.They said mind your own fucking business!Wayne...?Hello...?Robin...You did?Oh God...I can't. I'm keeping her.If I get rid of her, if I put her into the system...I can't, Edward, I --I don't have any faith.How... how do I...?Mike...?She's taking me apart, Mike.He told me I have to kill her.I'm not sleeping, I was hoping you could give me something.Lucy...?Oh my God...Who is this...?No... he's...I have to go.What did you do to him?WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?!Get out of my house.GET OUT!Stay away from me!STAY AWAY FROM ME!!No...Please...WHAT DO YOU WANT?!!Okay... okay, I will, I will, I promise.Okay... I'll be right there.I'll have one later.Tomorrow's our new beginning.I know.Get some rest.I love you.Forever and ever.Right down the hall.Sweetheart...?It's not real.Are you scared?!ARE YOU SCARED?!I'M NOT!!Where is she? Where'd they put her? Foster care? Is she with a family?
