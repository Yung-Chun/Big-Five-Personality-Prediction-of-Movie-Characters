It was authorized by a doctor!Then check China, Amsterdam and Israel cause that's where I'm fuckin' goin'!I got first hand experience with all of 'em. And I'll tell you something else, if I don't know what somethin' is, or don't trust the white coat who's trying to sell it to me, I fed-ex it to my lab in Seattle and they test if for me.Then I test it all on myself before I give it to anyone else. I'm my own lab rat.Compound Q. You know what happens if I come off it? My hair falls out, I lose weight, I can't get my dick up and I start to die. I got three hundred other people with the same experience. Peptitde T. Gets rid of dementia. Stop takin' it and you can't think straight, walk straight, or act straight. I got over two hundred people on that. You following me? DDC and DDI, both toxic, but in small doses, helps kick opportunistic infections.All the hospital wants is to serve up AZT.Fuck the virus, once you got that, you're married to it. I'm more concerned about my symptoms and survival. I mean, I'm no scientist but...You fuckin' high again?Are you listenin' to what I'm sayin' here about usin' that shit? And what the fuck did you do to my wall?!People can live with this thing for longer than they're saying. Ninety-six- percent of people diagnosed with AIDS in the U S of A will be dead in under six months.Then use them. Why give people AZT when their immune system is broken? It's fuckin' toxic!Maybe I did abuse it, but I'm off it now, and I'm here, feeling good. And I'm not the only one.Why is Boy George's goddamned face everywhere in my room?Take your sunflower and get out.You know what, look at it, don't look at it, I don't give a shit.Don't touch!If you ain't doin' poppers and coke, how come you look like such shit?You pussy, stick it in. Who do you think is gonna do that when I ain't here?Rayon, I swear, God sure was dressin' the wrong doll when he blessed you with a pair of balls. Give me that thing.You know it's one thing for me not to like you, but why don't you be a better friend to yourself?What are you doin' here?Nice work, fellas, great. This is how you got Al Capone, ain't it?A fine? Fine, alright, how much? Ten thousand? Twenty thousand? I'll write you a check right now.You think that will stop me, you motherfuckers!Rayon, I don't need help gettin' ladies from your sorry ass.It's the Wildflowers. Texas style.Thanks for coming.The IRS is on my ass. I wonder who tipped them off? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 63Nah. But you gonna have to watch what you say when you're around that snake you work with. He's the virus I'm worried about. As a matter fact, if you hear of anything...Bring us your best bottle of Cabernet.Nice restaurant, beautiful woman. I feel like a human being again. How come you ain't got no high powered corporate honey to take you dancin'?That's cause you don't got a honey. How old are you anyway? Twenty two?To eat, drink, enjoy life, be merry...Take a break, relax, breathe, Saks.Normal people do that, ya know.So why'd you become a doctor?Not what I thought you'd say but makes sense, your dad was a practical man.Well my old man was an electrician. A good one too. But he was a better drinker. Which I learned from him as well.So I was around it a lot. Got pretty good at takin' shit apart, seein' how the insides worked, and then puttin' it back together. I was good at it and it put some change in my pocket.She was a painter, kind of a gypsy. She got tired a' all the shit and left. You know how it is.Don't feel like you gotta hang it. I know you like everything perfect.You need to enjoy your life, little lady. You only got one.I'm gonna kill him!We're running low on DDC and Peptide-T, I thought you were stocking this?Scientifically controlled, my ass! They took eight months to approve it. And from what we know now, AZT is everything but safe!That's four pills, three times a day with food. The vitamins too.The hell's all this?In other words, my entire inventory.Aloe vera! It's a plant. What do you give a shit if people eat plants?It's a bullshit technicality and you know it! Get my lawyer on the phone.Illegal? Unapproved! These are vitamins and minerals, for Chrissake!I'm not selling that stuff, you confiscated it, remember? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 68What's the matter, you got Alzheimer, Richard? 'Cause Peptide T works for Alzheimers too, ya know?Come on, it's a protein! Effective with dementia which I have. Why don't you just look at my research?Don't threaten me! I'm unapproved motherfucker! The process? That's just FDA bullshit for pay up! 250 million worth!These fuckers are comin' at me from all angles! I wanna file a restraining order!The Government and their fuckin' FDA!We gotta relocate!It means we were unapproved. Now we're illegal!Let's get outta here.Send a round of beers over to my friends.You ain't gettin' tits, Rayon. Memberships are high and so is demand. So we recruit more members from where?Yep! I'm gotta find MDs to write them prescriptions so we can keep dealin' these drugs... legally now.Oh yeah, Bonnie and Clyde comin' in for a loan. Stop starin' at her tits, you're startin' to look normal.Tuck, sorry to hear about your dad's Alzheimer. This will help. Woodroof.This place is crap, I'll give you one fifty a month and fifty percent off your meds.Don't try to con me --What do you want?Oh. Well that's good news.Hello... Howdy...I got what you got and I have traveled the world looking for alternative medications, stuff not available yet in America, thanks to the good folks down at the FDA.Some of you may have heard of the Dallas Buyers Club, an organization I founded with my friend Rayon. Risk might be high, but what the hell, you're risking your life every time you go into one of them there hospitals. I don't know where most of the people are who were at these meetings a year and a half ago... maybe they lost interest... maybe they're dead... but I'm here. I'm walking, talking, breathing... and ain't no one gonna take that away from me. I gotta life to lead.HIV don't mean shit. You ain't sick, you ain't sick. Period. You tell a guy he's got a week to live? Shit, he's already dead. You tell a guy he can keep on goin'? He'll find a way. Remember, ya ain't dyin'. But if you think you are then you ain't got nothing to lose.What? No, please, wait a minute, doc... Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 75All the MDs are fuckin' backpeddlin' on their heels. The FDA is scaring them with license revocation if they write scripts.Where'd you get that?Did you sell your ass?Really, come on, where did you get it?Goin' to Mexico, chica, you comin'?Come on, tequila, sunshine, tacos, never hurt anybody.I knew you'd rain on my party, but I had to give it a shot. Listen, I gotta ask you a favor. I need you to write me prescriptions so I can come across the border. I might not need it but if I do, I'll have them.You know this rule that the FDA just passed was just bullshit. Ain't no doc from here to the north pole will write them.Okay! Never hurts to ask.Keep it, nurse Ratched!Doesn't surprise me at all.The anti-fungal, right? I read about this.As much I can carry.Hell Vass, I'm just tryin' to run a business.Yes sir.No shit? Well how's that for a coincidence?You said it.Can you prove they're not?Where's Rayon?Sevaaaaard!Sevard!There you are, you son of a bitch.You killed him.You call yourself a doctor? You are a murderer.Arrest me? Did you hear that?First class everything, big house, Mercedes Benz. That's what they pay him to say it's OK to pump poison into y'all.Get away from me. I got AIDS. I'll spit on you.You see this? This is harassment. Get me my attorney or do I have to be my own lawyer too. Own doctor, own lawyer.Hook `em up.Sell my car and make sure everyone gets what they need.Just dance.Anemia, Cancer, Bone Marrow depletion, Fever, Diarrhea, Vomiting, Neuropathy, Anxiety, Dizziness, Impotence, Hearing loss, Nervousness, Seizures... Sound like AIDS to you? That there comes inside a box of AZT, a list of side effects.... and got carried out in a trash bag three days later!Let me ask you something. Let's say I have the cure right here in my back pocket. I could save everyone today.But I don't have no funding and I don't have no backing. Now how long is it gonna take before the FDA approves it?Read that and you tell me how wrong is too wrong?I got three thousand people who need to get their hands on Peptide T. Now. Including me.If I don't get it by the end of the week I wanna file a lawsuit.Well find a place where it's not, Goddamnit. Go to San Francisco, get a sissy judge, figure it out!Perfect.Here you go, please read this.I'm givin' people information... on this trial I'm in, right now. I want everyone here to know what's going on.Why was Peptide T cut off? A non-toxic drug, that I have proof works and that according to the National Institute of Mental Health, is completely safe.I'm a drug dealer? You're the drug dealer. The pharmaceutical companies are the drug dealers.The yellow number fives, red, green and purple dye you put in this here candy causes seven kinds a cancer.The aspartame in my diet coke, the steroids in my meat, the hormones in my milk, the antibiotics in the chicken. Now that's the shit the FDA knows will kill you. Yet you're all up there worried that some sick people will find somethin' without you and y'all won't get paid.Oh I'm bad, I'm nationwide!One left.That was a ballsy move!A nice, warm hug... ...and a day of watchin' some bull ridin', that's what you need, doctor Woodroof's order.Don't you miss a regular life?Yeah, I guess. I just want...... an ice-cold beer at Ruby's. Go dancin' with my woman. I want kids... thumb wrestle with my sons. I don't know. I got one life -- mine. But I want someone else's. I feel I'm fighting for a life I ain't got the time to live.I want it all to mean somethin'.I still am!I'm glad you're doin' better, sir.Thanks for the tip, Tuck.I ain't no cop. Why'nt you tell 'em?It's the bust of the century! Don't they look like hardened criminals?! Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 92Deadly drugs? What the fuck?I can't believe it.

Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 8So you're conducting another animal study?How long do you see the study going on?Does it not drive you just a little bit crazy when these guys stand up there talking about curing the sick while they're flashing gold Rolexes? What do they know about sick patients?Blood tests.We didn't test you for drugs.We ran the blood test several times.That's some information on HIV and AIDS you may find informative and your test results.Mr. Woodroof?Fine. How can I help you?No. I'm a fucking doctor!If you want to discuss your list of problems, you can meet me in my office in twenty minutes.That isn't how it works. For about a year, a group of patients will either get the drug or a placebo, it's left up to chance, not even the doctors are allowed to know.It's the only way to know if a drug works. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 16Unfortunately no. But when it's proven to work and if you fit the profile, then yes.None of those drugs have been approved by the FDA.Mr. Woodroof, I assure you that would be a waste of precious time.There is a support group that meets every day at Draddy Auditorium, perhaps you could share your feelings and concerns...You missed your last trial appointment. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 22Rayon, the whole point of this study is to determine whether AZT is helping people.That doesn't mean I'm going to stop trying.You're in the hospital.You almost died.Get some rest.Mr. Woodroof!Where are you going?You're too sick to leave here.We can keep you comfortable at least.As your doctor, I cannot recommend you to do this.It's open!Mr. Woodroof... Ron, I thought you were... Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 34What are you doing here? You look great.What happened to you?I'm sorry, but what is this?Excuse me?No. Don't... I don't really eat here.Tell me what's wrong.What?What the hell do you think you're doing?!He's a participant in a clinical trial, we need to get him to the hospital!Are you out of your mind?! If anything happens to him--It's a blind study! We don't even know if he's getting AZT!Leave, please!This man also had a transfusion?He's actually getting worse.What do you mean?Really?Transfusions always makes patients feel better. Give the placebo patients new blood and they'll feel better too.I have questions about the drug's safety. I've seen it drop white blood cells in a lot of my patients making them more susceptible to infection.After six months?But we have no idea what the long term effects are. It's irresponsible.Can I see a copy of the study?A press release from the NIH?He didn't call, leave a message?What are you doing here?Where's Rayon? You're roommates now?Roger Thompson? This is my patient. Are you treating these people?With what?Tell Rayon I was looking for him. And I'm telling my patients to stay away from here.He came in once for advice. I have no idea what he does outside of this hospital.Actually, I've been reading about Buyers Clubs. They say they found other drugs that are eliminating symptoms. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 55-57Ron, I respect that you're learning about your illness but some of these people should be in the hospital.AZT helps eradicate the virus. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 58AI know the statistics.If you're abusing it, like you did, with no medical surveillance, of course it is. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 58BThey're beautiful. Thank you. And I don't even have to water them.You don't actually believe I would do that?I don't dance.Why are we here?Yeah right.Because I was good in science. And my father said studying history was a waste of time. So I went to med school.Yes, he was. Your turn. Why did you become... an electrician, right?What about your mom? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 64AShe painted that, your mom?I do not. I'll hang it. I'm going to hang it. It's just... are you sure you don't want to keep it?I want all my HIV patients on the asymptomatic study to have their AZT doses lowered to the minimum, 600 milligrams.I don't need permission. I'm their doctor.I'm not doing a study for people who are asymptomatic with a toxic drug that makes them sick. We don't treat people who have antibodies for pneumonia or chicken pox when they're healthy. Why should HIV be any different?Says who? Barrow Wilkem?!Besides, I consulted with each of them individually, it was their decision.What are you doing? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 76Do I look like someone who takes vacations?I know and I can't either. I'm sorry. We can't write scripts for random people and random drugs. Plus what if something goes wrong with these drugs? We could get sued, lose our license.Good. I'll be in my office. Thanks for calling. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 79Rayon was a drug addict! It wasn't a day on AZT that killed him, but the disease as a whole!Ron, you stole my prescription pad! So don't accuse me of acting irresponsibly! Rayon came to the hospital on his own... Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 83AHe was my friend too, you know!What's going on?What? This is crazy! All these kids are HIV positive?Would you give this fifth of a dose to your own child?I won't. You'll have to fire me.Y'all go fuck yourselves!We're splitting that.Regular? What's that? Doesn't exist.What?It does. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 89This is Fluconazole.
