{"Help-The": {"AIBILEEN": {"raw_line": "I was...born in 1911...on Piedmont Plantation in Cherokee County. An UNSEEN WOMAN interviews Aibileen.Yes, ma'am. I did.Momma was a maid. My grandmother was a house slave.I done raised seventeen kids in my life. Lookin' after white babies, that's what I do.I know how to get them babies asleep, stop cryin' and go in the toilet bowl before they mommas even get outta bed in the mornin.' Aibileen lifts Mae Mobley out of her crib and pulls her into her expansive bosom.Babies like fat. They like big fat legs too. That I know. Aibileen sits with Mae Mobley in a rocking chair.I work from eight to four, six days a week. Ninety-five cents an hour comes to a hundred seventy-two dollars ever month. I do all the cooking, cleaning, washing, ironing and grocery shopping, but mostly, I take care a baby girl...And law, I worry she gone be fat. Ain't gonna be no beauty queen either. Mae Mobley reaches up and touches Aibileen's face. Aibileen kisses her and whispers in her ear.You is kind. You is smart. You is important. Mae Mobley's mother, ELIZABETH LEEFOLT, 21 and lanky, enters wearing a green dress very much under construction. Pins and double-stick tape hold it all together. Elizabeth has pointed features and a nest of teased, brittle hair.I reckon when you finish, it won't. Elizabeth exits with her pinned hemline sloping at a good twenty degree angle. Aibileen shakes her head.Miss Leefolt still don't pick Baby Girl up but once a day. The birthin' blues had got holt a Miss Leefolt pretty hard. I done seen it happen plenty a times...once babies start havin' they own babies. And the young white ladies of Jackson...Oh, law, they was havin' some babies.But, not Miss Skeeter... Skeeter has very frizzy blond hair cut short above her shoulders. She carries a red satchel.No babies...No man...And not lookin'. She wears flats, careful not to add more than a centimeter to her towering height. Dressed well, Skeeter tugs on her unfamiliar attire.Miss Hilly was the first of the babies to have a baby. And it must a come out of her like the eleventh commandment. `Cause once Miss Hilly had a baby, ever girl at the bridge table wanted one too.Once Missus Walters' arteries went hard, Miss Hilly moved her and Minny in with her. Fired the maid she had just to make room. See, Minny about the best cook in Mississippi, and Miss Hilly wanted her. Hilly's approach is marked by the whishing sound of her plaid, fat thighs.Minny my best friend. A old lady like me lucky to have her.It's a tricky thing...you try to make a baby go in the toilet bowl before it's time. If theys can't get the hang of it, theys get to thinking low a theyselves. Mae Mobley sticks her lip out.You drunk up two glasses a grape juice, I know you got to tee-tee.I give you a cookie if you go. Tee-tee immediately sprinkles into the bowl.Mae Mobley! You going! Aibileen and Mae Mobley laugh excitedly as Elizabeth storms into the bathroom in her finished dress. The hemline now slants in the other direction.I lost my own boy, Treelore, right before I started waitin' on the Leefolts... Elizabeth glances anxiously to the dining table then catches eyes with Aibileen, nodding ever so slightly.After Treelore died, a bitter seed was planted inside a me. And I just didn't feel so accepting anymore. Hilly enters the front door holding Missus Walters coat.Thank you, Miss Hilly.Hold on! Those are Miss Hilly's. Aibileen pulls another plate of eggs out of the fridge.Gots to have paprika on `em. Minny takes an egg. It disappears in a single bite.Watch yo mouth, Minny.Oh, law! Did she?Leefolt residence.She having bridge club right now. May I take a message? CELIA FOOTE, 28, peroxide blonde, stands in all her country girl glory. She speaks with a thick, unrefined, Southern accent, mired in insecurity.Yes, ma'am. Celia nervously twists herself around in the phone cord.No, ma'am.Miss Celia Foote called again. Elizabeth leans over and touches Hilly's arm.Now, Miss Celia had her a man. `Bout the best lookin' man in all of Mississippi. But, no baby and no friends. JOHNNY FOOTE, 23, Celia's ridiculously handsome husband, sneaks up behind her as he removes his jacket and tie.Yes, ma'am.Yes, ma'am.Miss Myrna gets it wrong lotta times. Be good to get it right.Yes, ma'am, it is.Constantine and me...were in church circle together.Yes, ma'am. Skeeter moves closer to Aibileen.Quit?No, ma'am. I couldn't...I knew I had said too much to Miss Skeeter, but Constantine's story weren't mine to tell. Some things a girl shouldn't have to know about her own mother. Her frizzy hair swirls about as she passes a truck full of cotton.Which one she want a get rid of? Them rings or the husband? Skeeter chuckles and shrugs her shoulders.Tell her a vinegar and Pine-Sol soak. Then let it set in the sun a bit. Skeeter writes this down.Bout an hour. Let it dry. Skeeter keeps writing. Aibileen notices something outside. Hilly walks into the Leefolt backyard with her son, BILLY, 3, perched on her hip. A CONTRACTOR, 30s, follows holding a set of plans. Skeeter turns to the open window. It's already started to sprinkle outside.Everthing's fine.I never tolt you that! Aibileen jumps up as another crack of thunder sounds out.You know what'd happen to me if Miss Leefolt knew I was tellin' stories on her?Other maids?They set my cousin Shinelle's car on fire just cause she went down to the voting station.`Cause they's a reason. I do this with you, I might as well burn my own house down. Bam! The front door slams shut.On top a Minny losin' her tenth job, eighteen people died in Jackson that day. Ten white. Eight black.God don't pay no mind to color or class once he sets a tornado loose. Within seconds, the rose blossoms are gone.Soon after, that bitter seed inside of me had sprout and was growing fast... Well into her second pregnancy, Elizabeth exits the house with Mae Mobley at her side. She wears an awful, homemade maternity dress.Be right there, Baby Girl. Aibileen pulls up her panty-hose.You got some \"Miss Myrna\" questions for me?Yes, ma'am. The bus pulls away.This already ain't careful, Miss Skeeter. You not knowing that is what scares me most. I'm sorry. Skeeter hands Aibileen a piece of paper with her phone number written on it. Aibileen turns and walks off down the sidewalk.I know pretty well what happens if the white ladies found out we was writing about them. Womens, they ain't like men. Women don`t beat you with a stick. Naw, they like to keep they hands clean. Got a shiny set a tools they use, sharp as witches' fingernails. As Aibileen ambles toward a bench, TWO WHITE WOMEN in nurse uniforms push in front of her and sit.Any person printing, publishing or circulating written matter urging for public acceptance of social equality between whites and negroes is subject to imprisonment.Everbody know you honest, Minny.What you did?!Minny! She can't bear to listen and hangs up the phone. She sees Skeeter's phone number taped to the wall. Aibileen's breath becomes heavy. Anger wells inside her. She picks up the phone again and begins to dial.Got dropped two streets over? Skeeter nods.Thank you. Aibileen motions for Skeeter to sit on a narrow sofa behind a coffee table covered in hand-tatted lace. A tray holds a teapot, two cups that don't match and cookies resting on folded napkins. As Aibileen pours the tea, her hand shakes.I'm sorry. I've never had a white person in my house before. Skeeter sips her tea.Miss Skeeter, What if...What if you don't like what I got to say? About white peoples?You gone have to change my name. Mine, Miss Leefolt's, everbody's.It gone be hard.Minny got her some stories, sho nuff. But, she ain't real keen on talking to white peoples right now.It feel...Uh. Aibileen glances up to the framed picture of Treelore.Yes, ma'am. He dead two years now. Got run over at the lumber yard. Lungs were crushed.I'm sorry, I- Aibileen covers her mouth with her hand. Skeeter becomes disgusted with herself.I thought I might write my stories down and read them to you.It no different than writing down my prayers.Prayer like electricity. It keep life going. Writing it down make it more powerful. Lot a ailing, sick peoples in this town.I didn't get a chance to pray for Treelore.God took him fast `cause he didn't want to argue with me. He was just twenty-four years old. The best part of a person's life.But he'd like we's doing this. He always said we gone have a writer in the family one day...After my prayers last night, I got some stories down too. Skeeter nods. Aibileen opens her notebook and reads.My first white baby to ever look after was named Alton Carrington Speers. It was 1938, and I'd just turned fourteen years old. Daddy had left us, so I dropped out a school to help momma with the bills.Alton's momma died a lung disease. I loved that baby, and he loved me. That's when I learned I could make children feel proud of theyselves.Alton used to always be asking me how come I's black...It just ate him up, so one time I told him it cause I drank too much coffee. Oh, law, you should a seen his face.Yes, ma'am. Aibileen's eyes narrow.I reckon I'm ready...to talk about Miss Leefolt now. Skeeter stops typing and looks up. She nods.Baby girl don't get her diaper changed `til I get there in the morning. That's `bout ten hours she gots to sit in her mess. I be so worried about her on my day off. I always come in an hour early on Mondays.Miss Leefolt pregnant again, too. And, law, I pray this child turn out good. It a lonely road if a momma don't think theys child is pretty. Charlotte glances down disapprovingly at the dingy, huarache shoes on Skeeter's feet. Skeeter heads for the door.Miss Leefolt be spending so much time keeping up with the society ladies, she done forgot the child she got now. Just then Minny barges through the kitchen back door.We all working for the same thing.You don't have to do this, Minny.And that was a good mood. Minny immediately storms back in the kitchen.Once Minny got to talking `bout food, she liked to never stop...But when she got to talking about the white ladies, it took all night...I know, but it hard, Minny. Mind racing, Minny flies out the door without a word. Aibileen turns to Skeeter.You gone and done it now.Don't give up on us, Miss Skeeter. Skeeter softens and sits back down.You gone accuse me a philosophizing.I don't believe in lines anymore. Lines is in our heads `cause people like Miss Hilly try to make us believe they there. Celia squeezes a canteloupe with another scared maid.Lotta of folk think if you talk back to your husband, you crossed a line...need to be punished.Cause it ain't there. `Cept in Leroy's head. Lines between black and white ain't there either. Minny and Aibileen watch as Celia exits the store with her groceries and prances toward her car.All I'm saying is kindness don't have no boundaries. Just then, MYRLIE EVERS, 30, approaches the bus stop with her three Children. SONS, 10 and 3, and aLaw, the Evers children have gotten so big!No. You got me. A bus pulls up and the doors open. Minny, Aibileen and the other maids step aside to let the Evers family board first.I'm on cut you some cake, Baby.It so pretty. Hilly begins bouncing William Jr. on her knee.Yes, ma'am.Yes, ma'am...And I thank you. Hilly smiles and nods.One thing I got to say about Miss Hilly, she love her children. Always tellin' them they smart and beautiful. Can't go more than ten minutes without givin' one a kiss. Hilly kisses her son gently.And, law, do they love her back. When she starts up on me, I just try and think a my sweet Treelore and how much he loved me. That kind a love makes me cry. Even when it going to Miss Hilly. Hilly again glances to the red satchel, staring quizzically at the worn booklet of The Jim Crow laws sticking out.Baby girl home.I'm here, baby girl. Aibee's here. Aibileen kisses her on the cheek.You is kind. You is smart. You is important...You want me to tell you one a our secret stories? Mae Mobley nods. The phone rings. Aibileen rises.One day this wise Martian come down to Earth to teach us people a thing or two.Oh, he about six-two.Martian Luther King.Looked just like us, nose, mouth, hair on his head. But, sometimes people looked at him funny and were just downright mean to him.`Cause he was green. Elizabeth suddenly barges into the living room.I be all right. My house is seven blocks from here.Naw, thank ya. I'll be fine...Law, I hope this ain't as bad as- Aibileen turns to discover the young man is gone. She stares into the darkness. Scared, she begins to run. She cuts through a yard and trips over a hedge. She falls hard to her knees. Terrified, Aibileen begins to sob. She sees Minny's porch light and pulls herself up.We gone pray for the Evers. We gone pray for Myrlie. Minny raises her fists.We gone be careful.We ain't doing civil rights with Miss Skeeter. We just tellin' stories like they really happen. Minny and Aibileen grab hands and squeeze hard.Happy Birthday! Mae Mobley two today! Mae Mobley laughs as Aibileen sets down the grits.You sure is, Baby Girl. Blow'em out `fo they run up in your grits. Mae Mobley blows out the candles.Fifty-three.Gone be fifty-four next week.I gots seventeen of `em.They all over town.Now, you know who your momma is.Everything okay? Elizabeth looks back. Her belly is huge.Yule May in prison, Miss Skeeter. Gone be there four years. Minny shouts out across the kitchen.The church gone send them boys to college. Gone pass the plate `til they graduate... The women part, making way as Aibileen leads Skeeter to a seat at the kitchen table. PEARLY, 58, sits next to Skeeter and touches her arm.That's enough, Gretchen.Get out a my house!Tell her to pour vinegar in her trash cans. Then them dogs will stay away. As Skeeter writes this down, someone walks onto Aibileen's front porch. Skeeter becomes worried. Aibileen looks to a wall clock and smiles. About a dozen letters and cards fall into a basket under the mail slot. Aibileen jumps up and starts sorting through the cards.Today my birthday, Miss Skeeter.And, from all over the county, my babies find they way home. Aibileen stops on one card in particular. She sits back down next to Skeeter.Some even from overseas. Alton Spears lives in Paris now. Married him a real pretty French girl. Got five kids, too...they's my grandbabies.I still don't drink coffee. Happy Birthday. Love Alton. Aibileen laughs and raises her hand to her mouth. Skeeter is touched. The doorbell rings. Aibileen jumps up and opens the door. A delivery man greets her with two more vases of flowers. Aibileen looks out to the street where a white woman gets out of her car with a huge country ham. Two little girls in matching dresses jump out behind her. The woman sees Aibileen on the porch and waves. Aibileen waves back and smiles. Catching it all, the moment soon grows bittersweet for Skeeter. She wipes her eye.The world done gone crazy, Miss Skeeter! And I'm scared! What if folks find out what we writing? Figure out Niceville really Jackson, and figure out who who?Y'all two gone sit there and tell me you one hundred percent without a doubt sure `bout all this?! Skeeter looks away..You trying to get yourself killed?!Exactly! If people find out \"The Terrible Awful\" was you and Miss Hilly, then we in trouble. Trouble there ain't words for!Lord have mercy. Ladies better hold onto they husbands tonight. Celia catches eyes with Minny. She smiles and nods quickly and then looks away, careful not to tip off Johnny of their relationship.There's Skeeter and that must be Stuart. He's handsome... Missus Walters?! Missus Walters enters wearing a floor-length blue beaded gown, circa 1943. A white orchid wilts at her clavicle.Yes, ma'am.Law, look at all them pages. Two- hundred and sixty-six of `em.If your momma won't tell you, I reckon I will.Constantine's story finally made it in our book. But the reason she got fired did not. Miss Skeeter just couldn't put that kind a shame on her own mother.They printed a few thousand copies with the worst advance Miss Stein had ever seen. The stack is \"The Help,\" in hardcover. It's wrapped in pale blue. A white peace dove spreads its wing under the title.We got four hundred dollars. Got another four hundred when it got printed. Divided thirteen ways that came to sixty-one fifty-three a person. Minny hugs Sugar and runs out the screen door with her check as the chicken sizzles.Minny got so excited she burnt up a skillet of chicken.I...I wasn't paying attention.Ever maid callin' to say they white lady's gone and bought the book. They so scared.The voters of Hinds County had spoke. Mister Holbrook wasn't gone have no political career. One-Arm Ernestine races to the storefront and removes William's campaign poster taped to the window.No. We ain't late.Who we clappin' for? The woman laughs.Churches over two counties signed our books. All for you and me. Aibileen points to the inside back cover.Doctor King signed it, too. He readin' our book. Aibileen glances proudly at the framed portrait of Dr. King.What's wrong? Skeeter pulls a letter out of her purse.Congratulations!What you mean you not takin' it? This is what you been dreaming of.If bad things happen, they ain't nothing you can do about it. And if they happen, at least now theys a reason behind it. A reason we can wrap our heads around and be proud of... Skeeter nods with little relief.Now, I don't mean to rub salt in your wound, but...you ain't got a good life here in Jackson. Plus, your momma's getting better- Minny aggressively chimes in.Go find your life, Miss Skeeter.Oh, Law!Where are you now?!I'm on come there now.Minny, now, you listen to me. That baby gone be fine, and you ain't never gone lose your job. Mister Johnny told you that hisself. They's more book money coming. Your baby ain't gone know about gettin' beat. You hear me? You free, Minny! You are free. Minny lets out a chuckle of relief and wipes her eyes.You hear me?Good morning. Hilly licks her cold sore as she steps forward. She glides her hand across the L-shaped crack in the Elizabeth's table, drawing Aibileen's attention to it.It not polished good? Humidity been fighting me on polishing day.Lemme...lemme go look in the kitchen, maybe I left some behind.You check in Mae Mobley's bed? She been putting things-I ain't stole no silver. Elizabeth whispers to Hilly.I go get her some syrup, Miss Leefolt.I didn't steal no silver.Woman!...I know something about you. Don't you forget that. Hilly narrows her eyes.From what Yule May says, they's a lot a time to write letters from jail. Plenty a time to write ever person in Jackson the truth about you, and the paper is free.I don't know. Already sold a lot a books. Fear floods into Hilly's eyes.Baby, you need to get back to bed. You got a fever.I gots to, Baby. I am so sorry.No, Baby, that's not the reason. I don't want to leave you, but...It's time for me to retire. You my last little girl.Baby Girl, I need you to remember ever thing I told you. Okay? Do you remember what I told you?No, Baby. The other. What you are.That's right, Baby Girl. Aibileen squeezes Mae Mobley for the last time. They both cry together. Hilly speaks up.Give my sweet girl a chance. Elizabeth avoids eye contact. Aibileen turns and walks away. As Elizabeth leans down to pick up Mae Mobley....HER WATER BREAKS. She glares at Hilly with shock and regret.Mae Mobley was my last baby. In just thirty minutes, I felt like my whole life was done. Of the thirteen maids, seven of us got fired. Several other maids got fired who had nothin' to do with our book. Guess our stories weren't so unique after all...But, like Minny, we was all free.And we's was a lot freer than Hilly Holbrook. She comes across a piece from Celia Foote addressed to The Starving Children of Africa Fund. A smug smile forms. She opens the envelope to find a check for $200.00 made out to: TWO-SLICE HILLY! Hilly screams as she rips the check into pieces.Ever so often, we all get a nice piece of book money in the mail. `Manna from heaven' we like to call it. Minny looks across the table and smiles at Celia who is holding and playing with Minny's newborn child.Thousands of our books went out all over the world. We had got paid to tell the truth and we just couldn't believe it... Aibileen takes this last page out of the typewriter and places it behind two hundred other typed out pages. She looks up to the framed picture of Treelore and rises from the table with pride.", "clean_line": "born piedmont plantation cherokee county unseen woman interviews aibileen yes ma momma maid

Mr. Blackly sighs, hands the resum\u00e9 back to Skeeter.Not exactly. Missus Stein-Elaine Stein, Senior Editor at Harper and Row Publishing. In New York. I'm going to be a serious writer, Mr. Blackly. So, when I applied to Harper and Row, MissusUntil I gain some experience, Mr. Blackly! See, it says it right there at the end. \"Great potential...Gain some experience and please apply again.\" Mr. Blackly pours the rest of the peanuts in his mouth.Clean? Mr. Blackly sees cigarette smoke bleeding under his door.Hey, girls.Well, it's supposed to take four years, Jolene. Skeeter spins around to Hilly and Elizabeth with a sigh.Sorry I'm late. I had to stop by the cleaners and pick up my black dress. Hilly and Elizabeth look at Skeeter with concern.What?Again? Hilly places her hand on Skeeter's shoulder.I'm starting to think this Stuart is a figment of your imagination.The cousin with one eye?! Elizabeth nods.I guess his black patch will match my dress. Just forget it. Skeeter storms off. Hilly glares at Elizabeth.I got a job today... at The Jackson Journal! Everyone looks at Skeeter as if she just threw up on herself. Finally, Hilly pats Skeeter on the leg.The Miss Myrna column. Have y'all read it?Elizabeth, would you mind if I talk to Aibileen? To help me answer some of the letters? Just until I get a knack for it. Aibileen clears dishes as if she hasn't heard a thing. Elizabeth gets very still.Constantine...quit us.I really don't want to talk about it. Okay? The girls nod.Anyway...I don't know how to answer these letters. Elizabeth looks to Aibileen.Could have been you, Hilly.Aren't we taking non-members? The benefit's gotten so big.Thank you, Aibileen. Hilly begins squirming in her seat, obviously making a point. Elizabeth leans over.Did y'all see the cover of \"Life\" this week? Jackie's never looked\"The Home\"...the what?!Maybe we ought to just build you a bathroom outside, Hilly. The room grows eerily quiet.Aibileen? Aibileen becomes nervous at the sight of Skeeter alone.I had hoped to ask you myself if you could help me with the \"Miss Myrna\" letters...So...Would you help me? Aibileen nods and looks out to Elizabeth on the street.Thank you, Aibileen. I plan on splitting the pay with you, too. Aibileen doesn't respond. She grabs a basket of rolls.Listen...all that talk in there today. Hilly's talk I mean...I'm sorry you had to hear that. Aibileen quickly turns her back to Skeeter. A gospel choir begins singing on the radio.Is that Preacher Green's sermon on the radio?That reminds me so much of my maid growing up. Aibileen starts wiping down a serving tray.She loved me like you love Mae Mobley.Aibileen? How could she just quit like that? Aibileen stops wiping and looks up to Skeeter...Yes. When I got home from school last week, Momma said she had quit. Back in March to go live with her people up in Chicago. She didn't leave me a note or anything. Aibileen turns and resumes wiping the tray.Could you do that to Mae Mobley? Aibileen slowly turns back to Skeeter.Do you have an address for her or anything? Aibileen shrugs her shoulders, reeling it all back in. Just then, Elizabeth walks into the kitchen holding papers stapled together. She looks between Aibileen and Skeeter.Aibileen, I'll drop by at ten tomorrow to get started on Miss Myrna. Elizabeth looks at Aibileen.Hey, Jameso.Momma! If the Smithsonian had wished to assemble the perfect antebellum home, Skeeter would be standing in it.Momma? Skeeter's mother, CHARLOTTE BOUDREAU CANTELLE PHELAN, 50, glides into the room wearing a wig. Her floral print dress has a gazillion perfectly pressed pleats. Charlotte turns to a mirror and adjusts an auburn-colored, `pixie' cut.It's a little too everything.Much better.Mom, I want to ask you aboutWhat really happened? Charlotte winces with pain and grasps her stomach.How could she just take off without telling me?Good for \"Fat Fanny Peatrow.\" She lowers the dress over Skeeter's head and zips it.They dropped out of college to become housewives, Mother.Well, I did get a job today.Writing...for The Jackson Journal. Charlotte plumps up the dress around Skeeter's behind.Momma, would it really be so terrible if I never met a husband? With that, Charlotte grabs Skeeter's hand and takes her to a love seat. They sit. This is serious.Oh my God!Mother, I want to be with girls as much as you wanna be with Jameso.It's a start, Carlton.Oh! No, Pascagolua! You couldn't have known this...But, see, I'm allergic to almonds.Last time I had an almond, I stopped liking men. Charlotte glares at Skeeter. Carlton lets out a chuckle. Rebecca is mortified.It's okay, Rebecca. They have a special root tea now.Daddy, what happened to Constantine? The room grows silent. Carlton looks down to his plate.I don't believe you. Skeeter looks to her mother who immediately busies herself with scooping up more broth.Mother, did you...fire her?She raised me! Charlotte slaps the table and stands.She worked here for twenty-nine years. Charlotte presses both hands to her stomach.Good luck down there, Carlton.I just couldn't tell her I didn't get asked to the dance.I'm already taller than the boys' basketball coach. How tall are you, Constantine?Momma was third runner up in the Miss South Carolina pageant.What about you? What did you want to be, Constantine? Constantine laughs.I was...well, I was raised by a colored woman. I've seen how simple it can be and...well, how complex it can be, too...between the families and the help.I'd like to write something from the point of view of the help. These colored women raise white children, and then twenty years later those children become the employer. It's that irony, Miss Stein, that we love them and they love us yet...we don't even let them use the toilet in the house. Miss Stein's swivels her chair back around and sits up.Margaret Mitchell glorified the mammy figure who dedicates her whole life to a white family but no one...ever asked Mammy how she felt about it. There is both undisguised hate for white women and an inexplicable love, but nobody ever talks about it down here.Yes! Charlotte knocks on the pantry door.Go! Away! Skeeter slams the door.So, yes, their side of the story. Skeeter leans back against the shelves.My mother. She just dropped by to-I already have a maid. Skeeter can't believe what just came out of her mouth. Miss Stein rises and sits on the edge of her desk.Yes, ma'am...You'd do that?Oh, thank you, Miss Stein!\"Dear Miss Myrna, How do I remove the rings from my fat, slovenly husband's shirt collar when he is such a pig and sweats like one too...\"Aibileen, do you ever wish you could...change things? Aibileen turns slowly from the window.I mean, all that talk yesterday and now with what Hilly's up to. Aibileen's eyes fall to the floor.My momma fired Constantine. Thank you for telling me that.Aibileen, I have an idea...Something I want to write about...But I need your help. Skeeter rises.I want to interview you...about what it is like to work as a maid. Aibileen stops at the refrigerator, gripping the life out of its handle.I'd like to do a book of interviews about working for white families. Show what it's like to work for, say...Elizabeth. Aibileen begins to perspire. She grabs the counter to steady herself, then moves toward her chair.I was thinking we wouldn't tell her. The other maids will have to keep it secret, too.I was hoping to get four or five. To really show what it's like in Jackson. To see what y'all get paid, the babies, the bathrooms, the good and the bad. Aibileen shakes her head.A book has never been written like this, Aibileen.Fine.Afternoon, Aibileen. Aibileen nods nervously, looking at the other domestics.Can I talk to you? A bus pulls up.No. Yule May and others board. Skeeter grabs Aibileen's arm.Please. Aibileen signals to Yule May to go on ahead without her.Please let me interview you. I know it's scary, but I really believe this has to be done. We'll be careful.I parked way up on State Street and caught a cab here like you asked.Aibileen, I now know it's against the law for us to meet like this. Skeeter stares Aibileen up and down. Aibileen self- consciously flattens our her dress.I've never seen you out of uniform before. You look nice, Aibileen.I've never been in a colored person's home before. I think we're both doing great. This tea is really nice. Aibileen watches as Skeeter takes a bite of the cookie.I...this isn't about my opinion. It doesn't matter how I feel.Everybody? So, you know other maids who might be interested? Aibileen is quiet for a moment. She shakes her head.What about Minny?What does it feel like, to raise a white child when your own child's at home, being...looked after by somebody else?Is that your son?I'm so sorry. That's horrible. And, Aibileen, you don't have to call me \"ma'am.\" Not here anyway. Aibileen nods. Skeeter stares at her list of questions.Do you want to talk about the bathroom? Or, about Elizab--Miss Leefolt? Anything about the way she pays you? Has she ever yelled at you in front of Mae Mobley? Aibileen shakes her head.No, I am. She pulls out a stack of Miss Myrna letters.Let's just do a couple of Miss Myrna letters, and I'll run on...Well, sure I guess.You don't say your prayers aloud?I'm sure.Oh, Aibileen.This is great. You have no idea how much I appreciate this...But I just have to ask. What changed your mind?I, ah...Well, I-I'll have it in there soon. Skeeter glances at the initiative tucked in her satchel.Hilly? Do you need a ride? Hilly shakes her head with little emotion.I'm sorry about the newsletter. Hilly nods. A soft smile begins to form.With Momma being sick and- Hilly erupts with excitement.Oh, Hilly, he's cancelled twice before. Maybe it's a sign.You know I won't be his type. Hilly grabs Skeeter by the shoulders.Bible study.Momma, God doesn't care what day of the week it is. Skeeter walks out the back door as Charlotte shakes her head.I want to show her perspective...so people might understand what it's like from your side.I know, Minny. Maybe things mightLet's begin...begin with...with where you were born. Aibileen grabs her notebook and begins writing.So...you liked it?Does this mean you'll publish it?Twelve?Then we might as well stop!We can't do that! Aibileen and Minny lean back.I mean...I would never do that. It wouldn't be real. It's wrong.I'm sorry. Thank you both for trying.I feel the hope in your fingers. Skeeter resembles a papier mach\u00e9 starfish.He's William's cousin. That's all I know.What is that?!Two hours?! Charlotte flips a switch and takes another drag. The machine groans to life. Skeeter's cap inflates.Thanks, Constantine. Do you think this dress is cute? Skeeter holds the magazine up to Pascagoula. Only now does she realize what she's said and done.I'm sorry. Thanks, Pascagoula. Pascagoula nods and starts to walk away then turns.Holy shit.He's meeting me at Hilly's. Can I take the Cadillac?I'll take the truck.I'll drive slow.Hey. As Hilly races toward Skeeter, William and Stuart stand. Stuart is as tall as he is handsome.It was so goddamn awful. I hit a cat. Hilly sprays Final Net.He looks handsome. Skeeter stands up and does a twirl for Hilly.All right, give it to me. One to ten? Hilly sprays Skeeter with perfume and stands back.Really?! Seven? Hilly nods, lets out a little squeal.Just water, please.THANKS?! So...you went to Alabama? Stuart nods. Hilly rolls her eyes.Now you're in the oil business. Hilly says you're a rigsite leader.That's not what I- Skeeter and Hilly watch as Stuart's and William's eyes fix on the front of the restaurant. Celia and Johnny have entered. Celia wears a tight green dress and the reddest lipstick ever put in a tube.I write a...a domestic maintenance column for the Jackson Journal. Stuart smirks, taking a huge sip of his drink.Well, you must be a genius. You figured out my whole scheme. Skeeter fumes as Hilly and William return and sit.I'm sorry, but were you dropped on your head as an infant? Stuart blinks and then smiles, somewhat impressed. Desperate to change the subject, Hilly claps her hands.Not me! A kiss from God couldn't turn this `frog' into a `prince.' Tables begin to stare.You know she can hear you, Elizabeth? Elizabeth looks down to her plate. Aibileen sets down the scraper and kneels down to Mae Mobley.Not in Mississippi. Birthplace of modern day government. Hilly narrows her eyes at Skeeter and turns to Aibileen.No, thanks...I understand.Ah...Yule May was just telling me how excited she was that her boys were going to go to college.Of course not, Hilly! Hilly approaches Skeeter.Not at all. I'm just so busy right now with Mom.My dad had me get that for him.Thanks, Hilly! And thanks for going through my things.What?!He's a drunken asshole, Mother. You wouldn't like him. Charlotte pulls a sun dress out of Skeeter's closet.Ha! Charlotte moves on.Who sent you? William or Hilly?Well, I haven't. So, just go.Actually, I don't. I've never dated anyone before. Stuart looks up and starts laughing loudly.What?I've got plenty to say...I can't think of anything worse. Stuart looks down and nods.Just give me a minute! Stuart turns.Let me get my sweater.I'll have a Co-cola. Lots of ice.I want to be a journalist. Maybe a novelist. Maybe both.Pretty?That's not it, Hilly.Technically, it was a typo, Hilly.I wasn't hanging-Hilly, just who is that pound cake money being raised for, anyway? Hilly rolls her eyes.What's wrong?I'll ask daddy to get her a good lawyer.Thank you. I don't know what to-Yes. Very nice.You don't have to do this.You don't know what they've said.Well, happy birthday, Aibileen. You should have told me.What?! Stuart throws his arm over Skeeter. Reality sinks in. Skeeter rolls over to find Stuart, eyes shut, smiling.Oh my God! Oh my God! When Stuart tries to get up, Skeeter flattens him reaches down and pulls the covers up over his entire body.Don't move a muscle! Skeeter props up on her side and faces the door making sure the covers hide that she's clothed. Charlotte enters and heads straight for Skeeter's closet.Morning, Mom. Charlotte pulls out a dress and lays it on the bed, right on top of Stuart.Sure! Charlotte spies a LARGE TOE sticking out of the covers. It belongs to Stuart, but she assumes it's Skeeter's.Great! I'll get dressed.Right after you went to bed.I'm not really ready for that yet.Oh my God! Stuart tries to kiss Skeeter. She resists.My breath is horrible.I love you, too. They kiss.You, too. We hear Walter Cronkite's parting thoughts on JFK.Are you okay?Aibileen. We've changed all the names. Aibileen snaps.It's too dangerous, Minny.But that's in a week, Miss Stein!Yes, Ma'am.Stuart! How are you calling me? Aren't you on the rig?Oh, Stuart.I have to work.I have a deadline, Sweetie. You should have asked me about this.I'm sorry, Honey. I can't come. Stuart shakes his head and hangs up the phone.I have one more story to type, but other than that, we are done.Mine. Aibileen looks at Skeeter.Mother, I need to talk to you about Constantine.Well, I have to speak to her.What...happened?How could you humiliate her like that?!Why didn't you help her?So you just threw her away? That woman did you the biggest favor of your life. She taught me kindness and self respect and you just threw her away like a broken appliance. Charlotte starts to cry. Skeeter isn't affected.`Cause she didn't have anything anymore. You broke her heart!I needed somebody to look up to. Skeeter turns to leave.I have to go find her. She needs me.And?Why didn't y'all tell me all this?When did she die? How long had she been in Chicago?I knew nothing about it. Miss Stein's P.R. Department called the station directly.Don't count on it. In her one year at Ole Miss she never cracked a book.Me, too.Stuart...I have to tell you something.I'm serious...and...you have to promise not to tell anyone.Yes. Stuart hugs Skeeter. She pulls back.But listen. Can I have your word? Skeeter has again ruined Stuart's big moment.I did both.What?I'm not stirring up trouble, Stuart. Trouble's already here.I had to tell you. You needed to know. Stuart shakes his head and pulls away...Just leave.You okay? Can I get you anything?Me, too.Stuart proposed.You knew?Just say it.Nothing! Skeeter stands to walk away.Oh, Momma. Charlotte slaps her palms as if throwing the cancer away.It's beautiful. Skeeter closes the book and sets it down regretfully.I got a job offer from Harper and Row...in New York.I not taking it. I just wanted to share it with you both. There's no one else I can tell.I can't leave you two right when things are getting bad from a mess I created. I set out to write a book to make white people thankful. But in the end, what we should say is \"sorry.\"What are you doing here? Hilly screams and throws her lit cigarette at Skeeter.You can't prove anything, Hilly.Exactly who are you talking about? You don't know anything.Careful, Hilly. Don't give yourself away now.I did not invite you here! Skeeter yanks Hilly's arm hard.You're telling my mother on me? Hilly opens the door. Skeeter grabs her. They struggle.You get out of here! Charlotte suddenly appears. Skeeter lets go of Hilly.Yes, Ma'am.Ma'am?No, Ma'am.What?How do you know about New York?", "clean_line": "important mr blackly sighs hands resum\u00e9 skeeter exactly missus stein elaine stein senior

Go get Momma!Minny, William took Billy out for ice cream. So, hurry back and get Billy down for his nap. No dilly dallying.Hey, girls!Put Momma in a chair before she breaks a hip.Aibileen, I want you to have this coat. It's too big for Momma now and it's way too expensive to put in the coat drive. Hilly extends the coat with a smile.All yours. Aibileen takes the coat.Go on. Try it on.About supper club tonight...Honey, Stuart had to cancel.He can't get off the rig, Skeeter. It's offshore! Stuart is a very successful oil man.One eye?!They'd be a fool not to hire you. Jolene raises her glass.Well, no! But, I bet the poor girls without any help, in South Jackson, read it like the King James. Everyone laughs. Skeeter's forehead crinkles.I'm so sorry, Skeeter.She can't take a hint, can she?That tacky girl Johnny married.Uh-hmm, worked concessions at a LSU game and sold him a hotdog. And, boy, he got a whole lot more. All the girls laugh.And live thirty minutes outside of town? Anyway, I ran into her at the beauty parlor, and she had the nerve to ask if she could help with the children's benefit.Yes, but we're not telling her. Everyone laughs but Skeeter. Aibileen pours Skeeter a cup of coffee. Skeeter looks up decidedly and smiles.Ah-hem. I'm fine. Missus Walters shouts out from the sofa.If Aibileen uses the guest bathroom, I'm sure she uses yours too.Wouldn't you rather them take their business outside? Skeeter sees a reflection of Aibileen listening off of a picture in the hall. Skeeter tries to change the subject.-Tell Raleigh every penny he spends on a colored's bathroom, he'll get back in spades when y'all sell. It's just plain dangerous. Everybody knows they carry different diseases than we do. I double. Elizabeth takes a puff of her cigarette and fidgets with her cards.That's why I've drafted The Home Help Sanitation Initiative.As a disease preventative bill that requires every white home to have a separate bathroom for the colored help. I've even notified the Surgeon General of Mississippi. I'll pass. Skeeter again glances at Aibileen. Their eyes meet.You ought not to joke about the colored situation. Hilly leans in toward Skeeter.I'll do whatever it takes to protect our town. Your lead, Jolene. Jolene suddenly looks to a wall clock. She jumps up and throws her cards to the table.Build it just like the one at my house, right against the garage. The contractor nods. Lightning strikes, thunder cracks.Oh, mercy! Hilly is off and running with Billy. Skeeter seizes the moment.That should do it. Minny, go get me and Momma some iced tea. Minny hesitates. She gulps.Yes.Oh, for crying out loud. It's just a little rain. She can go get an umbrella up in William's Study!Minny? Minny panics, staying completely quiet.MINNYYYY, are you in there?Are you sitting down? Minny gets up quickly and flushes the toilet. Hilly beats on the door.We're running behind on our \"coat drive,\" girls. So hurry up and clean out those closets...But our Christmas Benefit, however, is right on schedule as y'all have already filled all our baked goods raffle slots. The girls applaud, turning to each other with praise.Y'all think we can put a dent in the African Children's hunger this year? More applause. Those who aren't pregnant, stand. Hilly beams. Elizabeth nudges Skeeter out of her chair.Now for some exciting news...I wanted y'all to be the first to know...My William is seeking election to the State Senate this November! Now, even the pregnant women stand. Elizabeth grabs Skeeter's arm and pulls herself up.He's runnin' on a platform of health. Protecting our children. Protecting our way of life. So, I, with William, have drafted The Home Health Sanitation Initiative. This sets off a room of whispers.Skeeter, when can we expect to see the initiative in the newsletter? I gave it to you a month ago. Everyone turns to Skeeter. Elizabeth panics.Would you please stand, Skeeter? As Skeeter rises, several women shake their heads.He's coming! Oh, Skeeter, he's definitely coming this time. This Saturday night.Don't you dare say that!It's your time, Skeeter. And damnit, I'm not going to let you miss this just because your mother convinced you you're not good enough for somebody like him.Boys, we'll be right back. Y'all talk about quarterbacks or something. Yule May, get Miss Skeeter a Coca Cola. Yule May runs off. Hilly pulls Skeeter down the hall.Skeeter, you don't even have on lipstick! Skeeter dabs her armpits.Well...What do you think of him? Skeeter applies lipstick. Hilly removes the rollers.Seven.Honey, you're beautiful. Just go on out there...you're gonna do great. It's your time, Skeeter. I just know it. Hilly hugs Skeeter.\"Roll Tide.\" We still love him. Hilly pinches Stuart on the cheek.William! The Lieutenant Governor just walked in. Hilly jumps up and pulls William away. The waiter returns with Stuart's drink and the water backs.We'd love your support on election day! Celia and Johnny walk up. Hilly stiffens.Thank you, Johnny.Sweetie, we need to go order our dinners. Celia musters up all the courage inside her.I did not.\"Save the dates\" were mailed weeks ago...You didn't get one? Celia shakes her head.Mail's a lot slower way out there in the country, huh?What'd we miss?Who? Is? Hungry? Skeeter stands.Run on, now, Yule May. Got a big crowd coming for Miss Leefolt's baby shower.Okay... Only now does William lower his paper.Go on...That's not working for free, Yule May. That's paying off a debt.As a Christian, I'm going to do you a favor. Yule May's eyes widen as a hopeful smile forms.God doesn't give charity to those who are well and able. You need to come up with this money on your own. You'll thank me one day. Hilly raises the paper up to her face as Yule May exits.Aibileen, are you enjoying your new bathroom over at Elizabeth's? Hilly nods with a tight smile and glances to the ground at Skeeter's red satchel.Nice to have your own, isn't it?Separate but equal. That's what Ross Barnett says, and you can't argue with the Governor.Aibileen, did you know that me and Mister Holbrook arranged for that bathroom? Sent the boys over and the equipment, too. Hilly stays on Aibileen, waiting for her to say something. Skeeter fumes, hoping Aibileen doesn't say it.Well...You. Are. Welcome. Hilly shoots Skeeter a last look. William Jr. leans into Hilly and hugs her.What do you \"understand,\" Skeeter? Skeeter and Yule May turn to find Hilly standing in the swinging door leading into the dining room.Is that true, Yule May?Did you also ask Miss Skeeter if you could borrow money?Skeeter, I'm starting to think you're intentionally not putting my initiative in the newsletter. Eyes down, Yule May hurries out of the kitchen.Skeeter...I'm sorry about your mother. And I know you must be so worried. Hilly holds up the Jim Crow booklet.But I'm worried about you. All this carrying on lately and now you're reading this stuff?I mean, around your friends is one thing...But, believe it or not, there are real racists in this town! If the wrong person caught you with this...you'd be in serious trouble. Skeeter snatches the booklet from Hilly.Get out of here! Hilly pushes him in the bushes and runs up to Elizabeth.Skeeter! She put it in the newsletter. I specifically said old coats are to be dropped at my house. Not commodes! Hilly faces the toilets again and screams.She put it in the newsletter when she knew we'd be down at the beach. Hilly steps up to Aibileen and points to the old men.Go help those boys GET THOSEYou are sick. Do not speak to me. Do not look at me. Don't say hello to my children. How long had you been planning to humiliate my family?You thought you were so clever, didn't ya? But I've already installed three of those old toilets in people's garages.I intend to tell Stuart he's ruining his reputation by associating with you. Jolene's yard boy saw you hanging around the colored bus stop.I guess your car was in the shop? Skeeter looks away.You know as well as I do, people won't buy so much as a slice of pound cake from an organization that harbors racial integrationists! Skeeter steps forward.\"The Starving Children of Africa.\" Skeeter nods and walks away. Hilly shouts out.Just so you know, Lou Ann Templeton has taken your seat at bridge club.Okay. First order of business. We're updating our newsletter. Hilly stares right at Skeeter who sits alone in the back.We're adding a fashion column with all the latest trends...Your dresses better be cute at next week's benefit! The women applaud and tap each other on their thighs.Now it's time to choose a new editor for our new modern monthly. Skeeter braces herself as hands pop up everywhere. Jolene French stands.Jolene, you're the sweetest thing!Please! A nigra walks in a pawn shop with a ring of such size and clarity. It took'em all of five minutes to figure out where she worked. Hilly leads the girls' nods of acknowledgement.I knew that girl was a thief the day she started.Nobody wanted to hire a sass- mouthing, thieving nigra, did they? Minny stands silent as Hilly finishes in three bites.Pie's as good as always, Minny.If...I take you back, I'll have to cut your pay five dollars a week. Not expecting this, Minny leans away from Hilly.What do you put in here that makes it taste so good?Momma can have a piece. Hilly slides the pie a little too fast down the counter toward Minny. Minny stops it before it falls to the floor.Cut her one.What did you say?Have you lost your mind?! Minny moves toward Hilly.Did what? Missus Walters immediately gets it. She bursts out laughing so hard she has to lower herself to the floor.Thanks, Jolene... Three dozen servers stand in a line. Minny and Aibileen are among them. Tables are covered with items donated for the auction. On the baked goods table, Minny's famed chocolate pie promises to again be a big money maker. Celia and Johnny enter the ballroom. Celia wears a hideous, pink and silver sequined gown. As usual, Celia's breasts command attention. The room locks on Celia as specks of light bounce off her dress and jiggle across the ceiling. A TITILLATED OLD HUSBAND tips his martini onto his wife's shoe.Everybody enjoying their dinner? The room claps enthusiastically.A cause I'm sure is dear to their hearts as well. Skeeter shakes her head as the less inspired applause dies down. Celia waves to Minny and jumps out of her chair.Why, Johnny Foote. I'm surprised to see you here. Everybody knows you can't stand parties like this. Hilly squeezes the crook of his arm.Where is that wife of yours? Out selling hotdogs? Johnny looks away.Oh, you know I'm teasing you. We dated long enough where I can do that, can't I? Johnny walks away leaving Hilly no choice but to acknowledge Stuart. She and Stuart never look each other's way.What? I didn't bid on anything. Minny turns to find Hilly smiling at her tightly.Well, wasn't that sweet. Someone signed me up for that pie.Let me go! Hilly stands up and pulls away. A ripping sound cuts through the air. Celia stares at Hilly's torn cuff in her hands.-You liar! Who did you tell?! Jolene loses her place on the list. The room grows quiet but Celia is still yelling.Shut up, Mother. Stuart belts out with a laugh. Skeeter pinches his arm. Celia is mortified. Sweat beads on her forehead.Johnny would never-You tell that nigra if she tells anybody, I will make her suffer. Horrified, Skeeter catches eyes with Minny and Aibileen. They all immediately look away. Johnny makes his way over. Celia holds her breath, shaking her head back and forth.Get that cleaned up before it starts to smell.Just come on home and stay with us tonight, Mother.You throw that pie away right now!You?! You signed me up? Missus Walters steps up to Hilly.Why are you frowning, Jolene? Hilly leans over and taps her television.You don't look cute that way.Don't cut her off like that.It's not Jackson, and that book is garbage. I bet the whole thing's made up by some nigra. Aibileen begins pouring coffee into Hilly's cup.The book is NOT ABOUT JACKSON! Aibileen spills a few drops of coffee on Hilly's plate. Hilly looks up to Aibileen slow and deliberate.You spilled some, Aibileen. Aibileen takes the cloth from the coffee pitcher handle and dabs the spilled coffee. Aibileen glances at Hilly. A secret burns between them.Get me a new plate. One you haven't soiled with a dirty cloth.Don't you get an inch closer! Hilly's a mess. Her shirt is half tucked. Her shorts strain to contain a newly developed layer of fat. A horrible fever blister burns hot on Hilly's upper lip.I've contacted my lawyer, Hibbie Goodman. He's the best libel attorney in Mississippi. You're in big trouble, Missy. And you're going to jail.I one-hundred-percent know you wrote it `cause nobody else in town is as tacky as you. Those nigras of yours are in a lifetime of trouble.I don't, do I? You tell Aibileen, the next time she wants to write about my dear friend Elizabeth...uh- huh. Remember her? Had you in her wedding? Let's just say, Aibileen ought to've been a little bit smarter before putting in the L- shaped crack in poor Elizabeth's dining table. And that nigra, Minny? Do I have plans for her.That was not me WHO ATE THAT PIE! Hilly storms up the porch steps. Skeeter follows.I've come to tell your mother what a hippie you've become. She's gonna be disgusted by you. Skeeter can't help but laugh.Missus Phelan, I'm...I'm here to-Well, I...I didn't have time to get fixed up before-Missus Phelan, I'm here-Aibileen, the silver I lent Elizabeth last week.When you returned it, three pieces were missing out of the felt wrapper. A fork and two spoons.You know as well as I do that silver's not in the kitchen. Aibileen turns to Elizabeth.Do you hear her, Elizabeth? She's trying to blame it on a toddler. Elizabeth won't look at Aibileen.Then it behooves me to inform you that you are fired, Aibileen. And I'll be calling the police. They know me. Mae Mobley enters the room.Elizabeth can take care of her child. Elizabeth looks to Hilly, appearing somewhat upset with this suggestion.I won't tolerate liars! Mae Mobley becomes scared and hides behind Aibileen's leg.I'm not talking about silver. I'm talking about those things you wrote about Elizabeth. Maybe I can't send you to jail for what you wrote, but I can send you to jail for being a thief. And your friend, Minny? That nigra's got a nice surprise coming to her. Johnny Foote listens to what I say. She's as good as- Aibileen shouts, interrupting Hilly.Nobody would believe something you wrote.Get out of here!You need to go now, Aibileen! Aibileen rises up from Mae Mobley and turns to Elizabeth.", "clean_line": "minny momma minny william took billy ice cream hurry billy nap dilly dallying hey girls momma chair breaks hip aibileen want

You need help coming down? MISSUS WALTERS, 60, passes quietly behind Minny.Gone give me a heart attack! Missus Walters ambles toward the closet door. Minny quickly tries to turn her toward the front door. Missus Walters resists.It's ninety degrees out there, Missus Walters. Missus Walters pulls out a red, wool coat with cheetah print collar. The early stages of Alzheimer's have appeared, but Missus Walters is still quite proud at eighty percent capacity.Yes, ma'am. Minny raises the pie behind Hilly's beehive, dreaming of smashing it into her head.Forgive me, Lord, but I'm gonna have to kill that woman.Looks like a walking Christmas present with all them bows. Aibileen shakes with silent laughter.And, now she gone to puttin' pencil marks on the toilet paper.Uh-hum. But, I carry paper in from my own damn house. That fool don't know.Uh...Miss Hilly?Never mind. As Minny turns, Missus Walters calls out to her.I'm gone get your tea.Yes, ma'am...Oh, Aibileen! I went and did it now! Minny wraps a hand up in the phone cord.Miss Hilly been tellin' everbody in town I stole a candelabra! That's why I can't get no job.Oh, but I got her back...I did something awful, Aibileen.I cain't tell! I ain't tellin' nobody! I done a terrible awful thing to that woman. And now she knows what I did! Hilly answers the door and snarls at Minny. Minny presents the pie and says \"I am sorry.\" Hilly waves Minny inside.She got what she deserve, Aibileen. But, now I ain't gone never get no work again...Leroy gone kill me. Minny's husband, LEROY, 40, approaches behind Minny. Minny slowly turns...Eat up, Girl. Miss Woodra's like to not feed ya on try-out day. Sugar takes a bite of toast.I still say you're too young to be waitin' on white peoples...Now, Sugar, I want you to listen to me, and you listen to me good. Minny grabs Sugar's face and looks her right in the eyes.These are the rules for working in a white lady's house. Sugar jerks her face away and sticks her lip out.Rule Number One: Don't you ever let White Lady find you sittin' on her toilet. Sugar nods.Number Two: You keep your nose out of White Lady's problems, and don't cry to her with yours. White people ain't your friends.Number Three: When you're cooking white food, taste it with a different spoon. They see you put the tasting spoon back in the pot, might as well throw it all out. Spoon, too.Four: You use the same cup, same fork, same plate every day. Minny takes her first step on the stairs.Five: Don't hit her kids. White people do they own spanking. Minny slowly raises her hand to knock on the front door.Six: No sass-mouthing! Minny knocks.No, thank you. I'm Minny Jackson... You...cooking something?What in the hell- Minny catches herself.Where you from? Celia lowers her head in shame...I know Sugar Ditch. My cousin live there. Celia changes the subject.When you gone have some chillins, start fillin' up all these beds? Celia swallows hard. She places her hand on her stomach.Gone be eatin' for two. Double the cookin'. Celia slumps her shoulders as she looks around the house.When you hear me say I don't wanna clean this house?No huggin', now. No huggin'.We got to talk about some things first. I work Sunday through Friday. Celia bites her pinky nail.Okay. What time you want me here?Okay. Now what your husband say you can pay? Celia looks away.And what's Mr. Johnny gone do if he comes home and finds a colored woman up in his kitchen?A course you do. Last one done got shot in the head. Minny sniffs the air.Miss Celia, I think you done burned up yo cake.You can't use no wet towel on a hot pan. Minny grabs a dry towel and picks up the cake.I'll take this burnt up cake with me so Mister Johnny don't see it.Aibileen! Minny stops cold in her tracks at the sight of Skeeter.Yule May told me what y'all up to. Aibileen nods. Minny's face hardens.Medgar Evers live five minutes away. They blew up his carport last night. For talking! Minny scowls at Skeeter.What makes you think colored people need your help? You white. Why you care?Well it's a real Fourth of July picnic.It's what we dream a doing all weekend long, get back in they house to polish the silver. And we just love not getting minimum wage or Social Security.What law's gonna say you gotta be nice to your maid? And another thing, I don't want my children going to school with white kids. And I don't care a thing about votin.' Only thing black mens get elected to is Deacon of the church.You damn right I don't! You two givin' me the heart palpitations. Minny storms out the back door. Skeeter looks like she might get sick.All right...I'm gone do it. I just want to make sure you know this ain't no game we're playing here. Skeeter nods, trembling as Minny slides a chair in the middle of the kitchen and sits.I's got to come up with your questions, too?!Belzoni, Mississippi on my great- auntie's sofa. Next!I put the green beans in first, then I go on and get the pork chops going cause, mmm-mmm, I like my chops hot out the pan. Just as Aibileen fills the first notebook, Skeeter hands her another from her satchel.\"Oh, Minny, I'm gone give you a week paid vacation.\" Now, I ain't had no paid vacation in my life. A week later, I come back and they'd moved to Mobile. \"Miss Lazy Fingers\" scared I'd find a new job before she moved... Minny spins around to Aibileen with sudden realization...We gots to get more maids! Minny stands. Skeeter's eyes widen with hope.Aibileen and I done asked everbody we know. Thirty-one maids. Everbody too scared, think we crazy...I got plenty a stories, Miss Skeeter. Just write`em down and invent a maid that said it. We already making up everbody's name. Make up the maids, too. Skeeter jumps up from her chair.What can you cook? Minny dips pieces chicken in an egg wash, then drops them in a paper bag. A puff of flour rises out of the bag.Well, I reckon if there's anything you ought to know `bout cooking... Minny holds up a can of Crisco.It's this. The most important invention since they put mayonnaise in a jar. You don't even know the things you can do with this here can. Celia peers into the skillet as Minny spoons out a mound of Crisco.Shake that. Celia starts shaking the bag.You supposed to eat in the dining room, Miss Celia. That how it works. Minny grabs Celia's plate.Here, I'll take your plate in the dinin' room for ya. Want tea?Miss Celia, you got a lot more to be grateful for than me. A car is heard pulling up in the driveway. Minny panics.Mister Johnny?!Miss Celia, I ain't playin' around no more! He gone catch me here and shoot me dead right here on this no- wax floor! You gots to tell him. Ain't he wondering how the cooking so good?Minny don't burn chicken.That's her. Aibileen's mouth drops open at the sight of Celia's shorts and tight sweater. Celia is having trouble selecting produce.Lord, she's trying to shop. Celia walks up to a maid, grabs her, and pulls her to the tomatoes. The maid, clearly uncomfortable, selects a tomato, hands it to Celia, and scurries away.Miss Celia just don't see `em. The lines. Not between us, Miss Hilly, nobody. Aibileen just nods.What you so quiet for? I know you got a opinion `bout all this.I ain't afraid a no philosophy.Oh, they there. I know. I get punished for crossing them.You know I ain't studying no line like that.So, I ain't crossing no line if I tell Miss Celia she ain't good enough for Miss Hilly? Tell her she ain't in Miss Hilly's league?Aibileen! You okay? Aibileen nods, trying to compose herself.KKK shot him! Hour ago. Right in front a his children, Aibileen.We living in hell! We trapped. Our kids is trapped. Minny turns to Sugar.Take your brother and sister and go get in my bed. Stay there! Sugar leads the kids to the back of the house.What they gone do to us if they catch us with Miss Skeeter?Hitch us to a pickup and drag us behind? Shoot me front a my kids?You a fool, old woman. A fool! Aibileen hugs Minny.I can't believe I'm on say this... But, I actually wish Leroy was home right now. Aibileen and Minny laugh a little through the tears.Miss Celia?Miss Celia, you in here? Minny hears running water and muffled crying behind the bathroom door. She presses her ear to the door.Hello? You sick? Minny twists the knob. It's locked.You mess up your hair coloring again? I helped you fix it last time, got it back real pretty.Miss Celia! Celia aimlessly moves the blood around with a wash cloth.Keep your head down.That's just God's way. Next one's gonna catch.He gone have to get over this. He needs to know this takes time.Yes, ma'am. I used to help Missus Walters practice.Because they know about you getting knocked up by Mister Johnny. They mad you married one a they mens. Especially since Mister Johnny and Miss Hilly had just broke up, too.Missus Walters says Miss Hilly still sweet on Mister Johnny, too. Celia suddenly slaps her thigh with excitement.They hate you cause they think you're white trash! And don't be takin' pies to those women!Now, Miss Celia...please don't be going to that benefit. Celia gets some ice out of the fridge.Did you hear what I said? Celia places the ice in a towel and approaches Minny. She looks at the cut above her eye.What are you doing?I got to get my work done.Hilly Holbrook been sent from the devil to ruirn all our lives.She had a lawyer. A white lawyer! But Miss Hilly friends with the judge's wife. Whole thing took two days. Arrested on Tuesday, in the state pen by Wednesday.No...So I been thinking...Maybe we need us some insurance. Skeeter look to Minny.I told God I'd never speak of it again. But we got no choice. It's time...Time to tell you both \"the terrible awful\" I did to Miss Hilly. It might be the only thing to protect us.I'm glad you like it. Hilly cuts another piece for herself.Take me back? Hilly takes an even bigger bite from the second slice.That good vanilla from Mexico... Minny's eyes narrow over a forced smile.And...something else real special. Missus Walters grabs a plate and reaches for the pie.No, Missus Walters. That Miss Hilly's special pie.I said eat my shit!No. But you're about to, `cause you just did. Minny nods smugly as she looks down at Hilly's slice.No! I never planned to tell her! I just wanted to see her take a bite and leave so I could be done with her. Forever! She was never supposed to ask me back. Minny eyes narrow.And, then for less pay! That got me even madder. And, then she went slid that pie at me. Oh lord! That was it! I just lost control, Aibileen...you know how I get, now.So, before I knew it, it just came on out my mouth...and I had tolt her what was in that pie. Aibileen looks to Skeeter shaking her head. Minny suddenly gets misty. She wipes her eyes.I've asked God to forgive me. But, more for what happened to poor Missus Walters. Miss Hilly threw her in that nursing home just for laughing.We need insurance! Hilly Holbrook can't never let people know that pie story is about her.Right! But don't you see? Miss Hilly gone go to her grave convincing people this book ain't about Jackson. Then we safe, insured! Minny gets up and walks toward Aibileen.You brought me into this, and I'm on finish it! Either put it in or pull my parts out all together. Minny storms out of Aibileen's kitchen.Look what she got on. Celia grabs more champagne from a passing server.Hilly can throw her in a home, but she can't keep the taxis away.Don't you never let me hear you talking bad about the lady who puts food in your mouth. Clothes on your back! You hear me? Minny storms off.Ain't Mister Johnny gone wonder how dinner got on the table if you laid up in bed? Celia pulls the covers off her head and sits up a little.She don't count. Don't judge yourself by the way she see you.You gone leave your husband cause you threw up at some party? Celia sobs.Lord, I reckon it's time you knew.Miss Hilly thought you knew `bout \"The Terrible Awful,\" that you were making fun a her. It's my fault she pounced on you. But if you leave Mister Johnny, then Miss Hilly done won the whole ball game. Then she done beat me, and she done beat you. Celia lies there. Minny's concerned she's said too much.Now we just wait and see? Hopin' Missus Stein publish it? Skeeter nods.What story you got left to type?Come on, Miss Celia! Get out a that bed and let me in. It's twelve noon. I did all the shopping just like you asked. The door slowly opens. Celia steps out onto the porch, looking beautiful, still dressed tacky.Well, look at you, Miss Celia.What's all this?Greens got just the right amount a hock taste to `em. That's a good pot liquor, Miss Celia. Who taught you to cook like this? Minny winks as she dunks a piece of corn bread in the greens.Corn bread's happy now. Celia lays down her fork.Why you ask such a funny question?A course I's happy. You happy too. Big house, big yard, good husband.Maybe I will. Celia jumps up.`One-arm-Earnestine' said Miss Leefolt brought a copy over to Miss Hilly in less than a hour. She better read it quick and start the \"this ain't Jackson crusade.\"Oh, she gone read it. Especially after that man made such a stink on the tee-vee. She gone read it.Who there?Please don't hurt me! My babies are in the house. Johnny drops the bat and pulls Minny up from the floor.I don't know about that.You knew I was there?I couldn't make you eat anymore corn pone, Mister Johnny.So I ain't losing my job?We late? Looks like Bible study done already started.We did something. We did something good.That real good, Miss Skeeter.You ain't got nothing left here but enemies in the Junior League. You done burned ever bridge there is. And you ain't never gone get another man in this town, and ever body know it. So don't walk your white butt to New York, RUN IT! Minny leans over, placing her hand on Skeeter's for the first time since knowing each other.And you listen to me. I'm on take care a Aibileen, and she gone take care a me. Skeeter nods.They fired Leroy last night! And when Leroy ask why, his boss say Mister Holbrook told him to do it. Said his nigger wife the reason.He try to kill me with he bare hands! He threw the kids in the yard, lock me in the bathroom, and say he gone set the house on fire.The gas station. I climbed out the window, and we all ran here.Wait, Aibileen...I'm pregnant.I hear you... The Leefolt front door opens.
