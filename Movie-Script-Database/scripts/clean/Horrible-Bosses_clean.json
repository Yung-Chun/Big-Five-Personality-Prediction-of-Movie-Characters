{"Horrible-Bosses": {"NICK": {"raw_line": "Damn.Hey, Jenna, it's Nick.Yeah, sorry. This is like the only time I have to make any personal calls. I just wanted to see if you felt like going out again because I had a great time with you on our last date.I know and that's my bad. I've been swamped at work --Right. Well, I'm up for a promotion which will give me a lot more free time --Fuck!Yes?I don't know, Mr. Harken. I might have been a minute late.Okay, I might have been two minutes late.No, I --Who are you calling?Wait! Okay, I guess I lied. But I didn't mean to --I understand. You can trust me.Oh, I'm sure she's... loyal to YOU --I don't.What?! No!None taken.It's 8:15.No, no. It's fine. I'd love a drink.Thank you.Aren't you having one?Oh. Well, I only took it because I thought you were having one.Well, I --Of course not.Okay.Got it.That sucks. You were the only one of us who didn't totally hate his job. Did I tell you Harken tricked me into having a drink at eight o'clock this morning? The guy's the devil.He is. And he's got to do it before the General Meeting next week.There's gotta be other dental hygienist jobs out there.He's not a child molester. He just took his dick out in a playground.I thought you were all broken up about your boss dying.He did say ten o'clock, right?It just said `staff meeting' on the memo. Funny how he gets all over me if I'm a minute late, but he makes us wait fifteen.You don't. Of course you don't. I'm sorry --I don't have a --I simulated a number of sales cycles, factoring in likely end- users, point-of-sale limitations and specific demographic variables.And in my opinion, an open plan selling process in our top 30 markets along with targeted upgrade offers to existing customers promises the greatest yield.What?Mr. Harken, can I speak to you?You've been hinting for months that I was in line for that promotion.So you've just been lying to me?(barely keeping itMy grandmother. I told you I needed to see her but you said I'd be fired if I left early. She died before I could get to the hospital. She taught me how to swim --I've been in that position for eight years now. Why would I stay here after being treated like this?!What?But that's not true! You can't do this!I feel like a total sucker. Harken was never planning on promoting me.It's true. I mean, I'm young. I could go back to school, change fields.I don't believe it. Kenny Orkin!You? Waiting tables? You were voted Most Likely to Succeed. Everyone thought you were set.You do that too?The other day I imagined shoving one of those jugs from the water cooler in Harken's mouth and making him drink until his bladder explodes.Yeah, Dale. It's not like we're actually going to kill our bosses.Well, of course. It's the one thing that keeps me from being happy.Very funny.Shut up, Kurt.I didn't get to say goodbye to Gam Gam because of Harken.No, we're not, Dale. We're just trying to live our lives. But what are we supposed to do when someone makes it impossible for us to live our lives? Do we just bend over and take it up the ass forever?Julia's ruining your life. That's wrong.Yeah, me too.What bitch?We were drunk last night, man. And didn't you say killing was wrong?Gam Gam.Probably not kill him.I want him to die.Okay, I'm in.What are you talking about, a hitman?But where are we supposed to find a hitman?Why would anyone follow us?Wait. You actually found someone?!`Skilled professional with years of experience in domestic and international wet work. Fast and discreet. No children or political figures.'Yeah, Kurt. Call him back and cancel.Guys! I think this is him!Nice car.All right, let's just be professional here. We don't want to seem all giddy.It doesn't matter!Yes, we are.We don't want you to kill us!You were looking in `men seeking men'?!You are such a moron.That's big of you.This is your plan?So, do you like living in Bangalore?Why don't they let you use your real name?You really think we're gonna find a hitman in there?Oh, real nice, Kurt. Way to be racist.So what do we do now? Yell out `anyone here kill people for money?'Kurt!Maybe we should go?Yes, we are. Are you a... businessman?Excuse me?So you chose `cocksucker'?Okay, here's the thing: we each work for a boss that we need to get rid of. Is that something you might be able to help us with?That's a lot of cheese.There's no way we can pay that.That's a lot more reasonable. And that would be for all three, Cocksucker?Should we bring the bills in any kind of special denominations?Got it.Or a paper bag?Got it. Thanks. Come on, guys.We'll cover the briefcase, Dale.So, Cocksucker, how long do you think it'll be before you've... taken care of business?We don't want a murder consultant. We want a murderer.That's five thousand dollars. You think we're just gonna walk away and let you keep that?That makes sense. But how would we fake three accidents?Well, we all have obvious motives for killing our bosses.That's pretty good.Yeah. I just need to get Harken to let me leave early.If I get fired before we kill Harken, this'll all have been for nothing. I'll just be an out-of- work murderer. I'll be down in three minutes.Sorry, sir. I've been fighting this bug all day. I'll just get back to work --Oh, okay. Thank you, Mr. Harken.Oh, it's on.Are we even sure he's home?I don't see him.It doesn't matter. Just tell us if anyone comes.Okay, let's split up. Look for any intel we can use on him.I don't know. I guess we'll know it when we see it.Holy shit, that's a lot of blow.What the fuck?!!We've got to get that back in the box.Look out. Let me try this.You think?We need to be better prepared. That was totally dangerous and a complete waste of time.Oh no... don't tell me...I guess so. But let's make a stop first.No more sleeve gloves.Take a right up here. Harken's place is about a mile away.Yeah. I guess we're really doing this now, huh?You know, last time with the three of us, it got a little... messy. What if Kurt and I go in and you stay here and watch out for Harken?If anyone approaches the house, assume it's him and give us a signal.How about you just honk once?Looks like the coast is clear.Kurt, wait!No, it's one of those hide-a-key things. Look...Wow. This is not how I pictured his place.Jesus!I think that was the same one.You want to cover every woman in... did you say `cock yogurt'?If he's so scared of us, why doesn't he just leave us alone?!Do you see a Day Runner or an address book?That's Harken! Dale's killing Harken!What the hell is he thinking?!What about Dale?Right. Let's go through the back!I can't believe that idiot Dale. You realize we're all going to jail because of him.Yeah, me too.What do you mean `well'? I'd get raped just as much as you.You think you're more rape-able than I am.No, it wasn't neat! You stabbed Harken to death in front of the whole neighborhood!Who'd you think you were stabbing?So let me understand this. My boss, who we are trying to kill, was dying in front of you and you saved his life?Hang on a sec. Maybe this recon wasn't a waste of time. Now we know Harken's deathly allergic to peanuts and Pellit has a huge stash of cocaine.Everyone would assume that Pellit just got a batch of tainted drugs.Perfect! Two fatal accidents. And we're not even there when they happen.Good. I'll get some rat poison and take care of Pellit. Dale, think you can get some peanuts into Harken's shampoo?What's that?Hey. Have you learned anything about Julia yet?I'm just waiting for Pellit to go to sleep. I wonder how Dale's doing with Harken.Jesus, where does he get the energy? Oh yeah.What's up, Dale?Good luck, man.Okay. Here we go.What?Where are you?(looking down at the rat poison,What the fuck?!It's Harken. He's here!I don't know. He's knocking on his door!Oh my god oh my god oh my god...He shot him. Harken shot Pellit!Shhhh!Fuck!Harken's gone.He's not moving. He looks dead.I've got to get out of here before someone sees me! Meet me at the bar. I'll call Kurt.Calm? How can we be calm? I watched a man die an hour ago!Well...I don't know if I had it in me.You think when it came down to it, you would've been able to murder Julia?You slept with her, didn't you?You are a mess.There is something clinically wrong with you.Whatever. We have bigger fish to fry right now. What do we do about Harken?Okay, but we should find a payphone. We don't want them tracing the call to us.Come on, we'll take my car.What the hell?Uh, yes. Is there something wrong?Can I ask why?We can't even say anything about Harken now.Uh, well, Kurt, being outside the murder victim's house because I was planning to murder him probably isn't the best alibi in the world.That means you'd also rat on me.I... was drag racing. (off their skepticalI don't win a lot.Where were you during the murder?Nice work. Where'd that come from?`We'? You were gonna turn us in!Maybe it's time to lawyer up.We did pay him five thousand dollars to be our murder consultant.One of our intended victims killed another of our intended victims.No. They don't suspect him.Is that how the cops caught you when you murdered someone?What?You did ten years for video piracy?I feel like such a moron.One of us needs to tape it to our chest.That's `cause you shave it.I have a better idea. Let's be in the house when he walks in. He'll be so mad, he'll be more likely to confess.I'll be in the chair.He's my boss.You're recording it all. You're the most important member of the team.Uh... hi... sorry we're late. I'm Nick. I work with your husband AND --He's going off alone. This is our chance.Okay, stay close.We know what you did, Harken.We were there. We saw you kill him.There it is! Let's go, guys --Hang on. Hold that thought, because I want to get my friend, KURT --(looking back at theWhat are you doing? What's in that?We had him! We had the whole thing. What happened to Kurt?`Hey'?! Where were you?!You're too late, Kurt! He confessed the whole damn thing!Yeah, you --(realizing what KurtUgh. Turn it off, Dale!Turn around! Get us out of here!Where are we going to go?What the fuck are you talking about?What if I was destined to smack you right in the face?It's Harken! Lose him!Jesus Christ, this guy's nuts!No, wait! Don't call the police! They're already after us.Why are you slowing down?!He's not stopping!Look, Mr. Harken --What the -- ?!I think this is gonna work out okay for us.I've got this. This is for you, Gam Gam.Hi, Carter. Just wanted to check if you had a chance to finish those regional sales projections yet?Okay. I was hoping to give them to the marketing guys today, but I can hold them off. In the future, it'd be great if you could tell me if you're going to miss a deadline.Thanks, buddy.It's good to be the boss.", "clean_line": "damn hey jenna nick yeah sorry like time personal calls

You really like it?Well, you're my queen. I love you, Stacy.I'm fine. Thanks.Uh-huh.Thank you.Uh, no.What?Oh, right.Julia, please.Hey!All right, Julia, listen. You can't keep doing this.She's not my girlfriend anymore. Stacy and I got engaged last night.We're engaged.Hey!That's a horrible thing to say. I never said that!Wow. Sorry, man. He was like a dad to you.I thought he was giving you a promotion.Well, at least your boss doesn't sexually harass you.I'm telling you, she's out of control. It's a full-on hostile work environment.Today she sprayed my crotch with water so she could see the outline of my wiener.I'm engaged!Thank you.I can't apply for another job, remember?It was nighttime and I was peeing! And it's bullshit that I got put on the registered sex offender list for that!Why would they put a playground next to a bar anyway? That's entrapment.Man. He must be grieving all the time.You wanted to see --Oh, God.Do I have to?Look, Julia, this is ridiculous --Now. Right now.You're naked, Julia!Okay, right there! Just saying `pussy' to me. That's over the line.Again! Naked, `pussy,' `faggot.' All over the line. And probably ILLEGAL --It was an empty playground! In the middle of the night!I'm not going to sleep with you, Julia.She stood there with her breasts right in my face.Why don't you guys quit? It's not like you're sex offenders.The world is your oyster.I heard you moved to New York to work at Lehman Brothers or something.Easy, Kenny.Uh, sure. Here's a few bucks, Kenny.What do you mean?Jeez.You guys are sick.Me too.Consider what?Yeah, right.Yeah, shut up, Kurt.Well, first of all, killing someone is illegal and immoral --I can't believe you guys are actually talking about this. I don't care how bad our bosses are. We're not murderers.What you guys are talking about is wrong and you know it.She's not ruining my life. If anything's ruining my life it's you guys and your drunk bullshit.I don't want to do it. And when you sober up neither will you. We're not killing anyone.I'm really not in the mood for this now --Stacy?!For... nothing. What are you doing here?Uhhhh... I don't know if this is a good idea.We don't want to take advantage of Julia.Wait -- no gas. She doesn't need to be out.Hey! Stop it, what are you -- ?NO!I knew you only brought her in here to mess with me.All right, that's it, Julia. This is over. You're out of your mind. I quit!What?Tell her whatever you want. She'd never believe you.What is that?... Yeah?You... you did all this while I was unconscious?How did you make it look like I was awake?This is rape! You raped me!Let's kill the bitch.My boss. Our bosses. They need to die.That was before Julia tried to fuck me on top of my fianc\u00e9e's unconscious body.I say we kill them all. Are you guys in or out?Yes! Nick?I was thinking about that on my way over. Stacy and I watch a lot of `Law & Order' and there's a ton of ways criminals mess up. Things we'd never think of. They leave behind clothing fibers, bullet casings, hair, skin cells --Exactly. And that's why we need a professional.Maybe you do, moneybags.That's the only problem. I have no idea.What people?Craigslist?! You found a hitman on Craigslist.This is so dangerous. What if he's a narc?What do we do if this guy gets here and he asks for so much money that we can't afford him and he gets mad and kills all of us?I bet that briefcase has one of those guns you have to screw together.Oh my God, he's like James Bond!No, no! We definitely don't want to record this, sir.Oh my God! I knew it!Please don't kill us.What's that?Oh, come on!Now, `Gregory.' Is that your real name?Aren't you worried about your car?You said they were the lowest of the low.Oh my God.I vote we go.This is ridiculous. We're never gonna find someone to do this for us.Oh, we're just gonna follow him into that alley?... All right.Your first name is Cocksucker?No, no. It's just interesting. That's the name on your birth certificate?Oh! Like Dean Jones. The actor from Herbie the Love Bug.Not `motherfucker'?Isn't there any kind of discount because we're buying three at once? Like buy two, get one free.Wow. Good negotiating.Or plastic. I read an article that plastic is actually better for the environment than paper.Should we deduct the cost of the briefcase?I mean, assuming we don't get the case back... We're not getting the case back, right?Well, that's like an extra eighty bucks. Only seems fair that we should take that out of your end.Then let's get a cheap one. It doesn't have to be real leather. Are you cool with faux -- ?Turns out we didn't really need the briefcase after all. Could've just used a manila envelope.I knew we were getting ripped off!Whoa, whoa! We don't want any trouble.You're talking about surveillance and recon.Hey, that's a good idea. Like Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train.Yes, the famous Alfred Hitchcock/Danny DeVito movie. You're thinking of Throw Mama from the Train. But it's actually the same idea. If we kill each other's bosses there's no link to us.Hells yeah!I don't get it. On TV, surveillance always looks so great. They've got their cups of coffee. Their sunflower seeds. They talk about their lives.And then, right when they reveal something really intimate, the perp appears and they spring into action.What are you doing?What about fingerprints? We don't have gloves.Got it. Wait, I don't know what he looks like.Got it.Hey, Nick? Does this count as intel?God, this must be worth, like, ten thousand -- oh shit!Sorry, my sleeves were slippery!I've got it.I guess we should've emptied the Dustbuster before we used it.Hey look, there's a piece of cereal in here. Can't tell if that's a corn flake or a frosted flake...You stole that from Pellit's house?Nobody said we'd be stealing.What did you need to get?Nice.Y'know... this is kinda, I don't know... exciting.I guess so.Can I have a pair?Okay -- again, I don't know what he looks like.Fine. I'll honk the horn six times.Honk the horn four times?People honk once all the time. You'll be running in and out of the house.Okay...(singing a la Cher,C'mon, c'mon... yes!Excuse me?Oh, I'm sorry, that blew out the window. I wasn't littering.Whoa. Sir, there's no need to be hostile.Get your what?Huh? Oh, yeah. It was a peanut butter sandwich.Oh god! What should I do?! Tell me what to do!What do I do with this? Should I inject you?!Okay, hold on! I got this.Did I do it? Did I get enough in?! I'm gonna do it again!He had an allergic reaction. But I think he's coming around. Do you know him?I injected you with your thing.Oh, it was nothing.I've never met your wife --Oh good. You guys are here. Did you see me out there?Pretty neat, huh?Wait, that was Harken?I wasn't stabbing anybody. That was an epi-pen. He was having an allergic reaction to peanuts and I injected him.Wait, you were just mad at me for killing him and now you're mad at me for not killing him?! See, this is why I needed to know what these people look like!But Harken must always have that epi-pen on him.That just leaves Julia.I can do that.Harken just left his house. I'm going in.Thanks.Ahhh!Nick?I'm not sure if I can do this.In Harken's bathroom. About to pour the nuts in his shampoo. But, I just... I know he's a real shithead, but he's still a person, y'know?What should I do? Should I do it?What?At Pellit's?! Why?!How would Harken even know Pellit?What? What? What?!Oh my god. Is he dead?!What's happening?What about Pellit?Shit! What do we do?!Me neither.`Afterwards'?Oh god. Please tell me you didn't sleep with her.So you took that as an invitation to fuck her?You're not a rapscallion. You're a whore. A filthy whore.They know everything. We're dead. I can't believe I let you guys talk me into this!You broke into two people's houses and stole a BlackBerry!Well, since I'm the only one without a connection to the murder, yeah, maybe I will.You want me to get you a Kleenex?`Making love.'Okay wait!Saying that we'll be here for a long time implies that we can't leave. Does that mean we're under arrest?So, you don't have evidence constituting probable cause to arrest us?Well then, we're free to go?Come on, guys.`Law & Order.'I don't have money for a lawyer. I gave all my money to Cocksucker Jones!Actually, it was five thousand forty with the briefcase.We don't even know why it happened. But the cops brought us in as suspects. What do we do now?Not the best negotiator, is he?That's horrible.What was it?Yes.If you're not a murderer, why do you carry that gun on your belt?Fresh batteries, fresh six-hour tape, voice activated.So what do we do now? Wait for Harken to come home and ambush him?Hey, we should find an office chair so one of us can dramatically spin around and face Harken.We could try and find more than one office chair so the three of us can spin around at the same time.I guess you're right. I'll turn on the lamp.Uh, yes. How's he doing?You guys ready?Say his name.The guy you killed. What was his name?We didn't know it was your birthday.More than once! Then he told us we were dead men! He's getting his gun right now!Is there anything you don't wax?What?!Everyone flees to Mexico. That's the first place they'll look.Hello?Oh God. Look, Julia, I can't talk right now --No! Wait!I'm not playing. I'm going to do it. I swear!Fine!I'm going to... have sex with you.Right now? You want me to say it?I'm gonna put my penis in your pussy!I'm gonna make you feel good. With my tongue... and my fingers. And whatnot.Yes! Yes! I'm going to beat your face with my cock!I'm gonna put my balls in your hair! I'm gonna spit on your arms!Nice job `fucking the crazy out of her,' Kurt!They think we murdered someone.I thought you were our friend, Gregory!Shit, shit, shit...So, you're not gonna shoot us?Should we stop him?Yeah.Could we do it on top of the patient? I like the element of danger.Oh, yeah.Julia, meet my old high school friend, Kenny.Kenny will do just about anything for fifty bucks and that's why I hired him to help me frame you. Your days of sexually assaulting me and your patients are over.Three losers.Shut up, Julia. Now, my fiancee and I are going to take a very expensive two week vacation which you're going to pay for.

You know how many times I've caught him doing blow at work?This again?She's a woman who wants to have sex with you. How bad can it be?Why don't you just fuck her?Oh yeah. Congratulations, by the way.Oh, right. Because you'd have to tell them you're a child molester.It worked out. Julia probably hired you because she's a sexual deviant herself.Well, I should go see if that girl wants to bone.This is how I grieve, okay?What?I was at your father's funeral.That excuse wouldn't have made any sense when your dad was here.It's not in the crapper. It's a recession. But we're still profitable.Your father made the decision to pay a little more to dispose of our chemical waste responsibly.But that would endanger thousands of local residents.They're not tribesmen. It's a MODERN -- Look, Bobby, your dad told me very clearly he'd die before he'd save money by hurting people.What do you mean?Margie's not fat. She's pregnant. I'm not firing her.Hank?I'm not firing anyone! It's like you don't care about this company at all.What are you -- ?!Look, Hank, this was not my --That coked-out douchebag is gonna destroy Pellit Chemicals.You know, yours just doesn't sound that bad.Yeah. Why should I care about protecting Pellit's name when his own son doesn't? There's a million jobs out there.So what are you doing back here?You're gay now?So I guess we're just gonna be miserable for the rest of our lives.What options do we have? We can quit our jobs and turn into Kenny. Or keep our jobs and turn into sad, ball-less losers who spend their days dreaming of ways to kill their bosses.Of course. Everyone does. It's the only thing that keeps us from going totally bat-shit.That's so funny. I had the same idea for Pellit.Only using gasoline instead of water. And his ass instead of his mouth.What's sick about it? It's just a way to let off steam.You have to admit though, our lives would be a lot better if our bosses were dead.Let's just consider this, for one second.Killing our bosses. I'm just being hypothetical here.Well, it's not like they're gonna live forever. These pieces of shit are going to die someday.We'd just be accelerating that natural process.Frankly, I don't see any reason not to do it.It may be illegal but I'm not sure it's immoral. Sometimes one evil person has to die for the greater good of the community. If Bobby Pellit has his way, hundreds, maybe thousands of innocent Bolivians will suffer. It would actually be immoral not to kill him.Exactly! Who knows how many other Gam Gams have died alone.No, we do not!Yeah!If it's bullshit, Dale, then how come we all want to do it so much?I was just being hypothetical.Huh?Whoa!I was in last night.Look at her. Look at Bubby.Look at Gam Gam. Getting a smooch from her favorite grandson. Little does she know that she'll never get to say goodbye to him. And why? Because his shithead boss wouldn't let him leave. What would Gam Gam want you to do?This isn't about Gam Gam. This is about you. What do you want, Nick?Damn straight!All right! Let's do this. How do we do this?Skin cells?! I can't even keep track of my keys!You know, that's not bad. I mean, we don't clean our own apartments, right? We hire someone to clean them for us.I do. Meet at my place tomorrow after work. And make sure you're not followed.I don't know. People get followed.Just meet me at my place.Come in. The guy should be here pretty soon.It was as easy as buying a used futon.Yup. But they don't post it as `hitman.' That would be stupid. They use code words, like `liquidation,' `pest control,' `wet work.' Check it out. This is our guy.See? He's principled.It's too late. He's on his way.I don't think he'd stay in business long if he killed everyone who couldn't afford him.Whoa. This guy's legit.How's my hair?Yes, hi, I'm Kurt. Please come in.Whoa, whoa. What's that for?Your ad said you do wet work.Yeah! We're men seeking a man, aren't we?It's right through there.Good thing I didn't call the guy who was offering to do `dirty work.'All right, I'll take the blame for that one.I'm going to make it up to you. I figured out a much better way to find a contract killer.Gregory, I need you to direct me to the most dangerous bar in Los Angeles.We need to find the bar with the most scumbags, lowlifes and hardcore shitheads. Can you help us out?Okay, Gregory? That's unhelpful. While I'm sure there are plenty of shitheads there, they're not the kind of shitheads we need.Now we're talking.Atmanand? How did you get Gregory from that?Actually, I do find Atmanand a little off-putting.This must be the place.Nah, Gregory's watching it.I think we're gonna have a hard time deciding between all the hitmen in there. Trust me, these are the lowest of the low.This isn't a race thing. We need a criminal and this neighborhood is where they live. I'm not saying that's because there are a lot of black people here. That's the fault of our society that discriminates and disenfranchises them.I was speaking socio-economically.Let me handle this.Hey. How you doing? Nice place. Listen, does anyone here kill people for money?Don't get me wrong. This isn't about race. Our society discriminates and disenfranchises YOU --I didn't mean you in particular.Okay, we're going. I'm sorry if I offended you. It was never my --Okey doke.I don't think he knows who Dean Jones is.I agree.We've got cheese. How much cheese are we talking?We don't have that much cheese.Great. We're in.And do you want it in any particular container, like a shoebox?Shut up, Dale.You told us you could take care of it.Okay, look. This isn't what we talked about.Can we just get our money back, please? Then we'll be on our way.Look, the whole reason we came to you is because we don't have the experience to do it ourselves.The Danny DeVito movie?We're outside. You ready for a little recon?What's the difference? He's not going to be your boss much longer.Okay, boys, as soon as Pellit makes a move, we tail him. It is on now.Ugghhhhh, I can't believe how much this sucks.Let's go check it out.We're not gonna get intel standing on his lawn. We have to go in.Here, do this.Here we go.Dale, keep an eye out. Let us know if Pellit's coming.Wow. This guy's a bigger douchebag than me.What kind of intel?Okay, my work upstairs is done. You guys ready to split?Not a complete waste.It's got his calendar and his contacts. This is what recon's all about.Shall we pay a little visit to your boss, Nick?Oh man, you should've asked me. I've got a whole box of those in my bedside table. (off their grossed-Very.Maybe something a little more subtle?Fine. Honk twice.Damn. Guess we'll have to break in the old-fashioned way.Holy shit. I broke the rock.For all we know, he's got a closet full of skin suits.Stupid cat. Let's check upstairs.God damn it! How many cats do they have?Little bastard.Damn. That's Mrs. Harken? I'd like to cover her in cock yogurt.I did.Ahhh!NO -- (glances out theHoly shit! He's really doing it! Out where everyone can see him.He's not stopping. He's gonna get us all caught. We've gotta get out of here.He's a psychopath. We leave him behind.I can't go to jail. Look at these eyes. Look at this ass. They'll be all over me.Well...No, of course you would. You're a good-looking guy.I never said that --Yeah, Dale, we saw you.Not cool, man.Not cool, man.We could put peanuts in Harken's house and rat poison in Pellit's coke!I bet he doesn't wear it in the shower. We could put peanuts in his shampoo!Tomorrow night, I'll surveil her and figure out how to take her down.All right. That just leaves us with one final thing to settle.Dale, if Nick and I were in prison, which one of us would get raped more?Well, I've learned that Dale is a homosexual because this chick is unbelievably hot. How's it going over there?Okay, let's all stay calm and figure this out.A man you were going to kill anyway.What?I can't believe you guys! You can't just bail on a plan like that at the last minute.I don't know. I mean, afterwards, it was kind of hard to imagine killing her.I know, I know. But it's not my fault.At first I was surveilling her just like I was supposed to...Then she started deliberately undressing in front of the window. With the lights on. She must've known I was there.Then she made herself a little snack. A Popsicle...... then a banana....... and finally a hot dog. I mean, three penis-shaped foods cannot be coincidence. And in that weird order? That's not a proper meal.No. I took her invitation to fuck her as an invitation to fuck her.I know. I'm a rapscallion.Hey. Not nice. And besides, I think I actually solved your problem, Dale. Julia just needed a good fucking. I bet she's not going to mess with you anymore.Here's what we do. We call the cops and make an anonymous tip that Harken killed Pellit. Boom. Harken's in jail. Pellit's in hell. Julia's had the crazy fucked out of her. Our problems are solved. Boom.Officer? This is not my car. Is it okay if I just -- ?Oh, please. We were just being hypothetical. You're the one who pushed us to do it.Why not?You know, I didn't actually do anything illegal, so...You gonna rat on me, Dale?Not if I rat on Dale first.Tsk tsk.Wait. My boss was murdered?! Bobby Pellit?!I can't believe this. What were you doing near his house?!I was making love.Let me ask you something, Detective. Let's say one of us knew who the shooter was and was willing to hand you that perp on a platter. Would he be entitled to some sort of immunity for that information?Well, then I'm glad we have no idea who the shooter is, right, guys?We really showed those guys.For, like, a second.We are so fucked.Hey, that's right! I forgot all about Cocksucker. Why don't we ask him what to do?Not great. We need your help.What? No way. You said the last five thousand would cover this!A wire. That's good.You did. You said you served a `dime' for `some pretty ugly shit.'Hold on. You're telling me we've been taking murder advice from someone whose biggest crime was taping an Ethan Hawke movie?!Come on, guys. Let's get out of here.Okay, looks quiet. Is the tape recorder ready?I'll do it. I'm the only one without hair on my chest.I don't shave it. I wax it.Right. We'll sit there in the dark till he comes in, and then switch on a lamp. That'll freak him out.Why do you get to be the guy in the chair?That doesn't sound intimidating. That sounds like a musical number.So I'm just supposed to stand there like an idiot?Don't patronize me, Nick.Hi, we didn't formally meet. I'm Kurt.Nick didn't tell me that his boss was married to a model.When did you quit?So fucking ready.Gotcha.Oh, hey.Uh, I had to go to the bathroom. Bad salmon puff. Are we ready to record Harken?Oh, man, I'm so sorry. I fucked up.Look, I wasn't thinking. She's so hot and I'm so weak. I'm a weak, weak man. I admit it.In here? But all those people are right outside.I wax them.Oh yeah... oh shit!Yeah, Dale, turn that off!Holy shit! They must have found my DNA.Okay, it's clear that none of us can go home again. Probably ever.I'm sure they have cops at all our places. I think our best bet is to get out of the country.Mexico?You're right. What about Asia? We could become kick boxers.What if our entire lives have been leading up to this moment? What if we were destined from the very beginning to become Asian kick boxers?That seems like a lesser destiny.Oh, shit. We've got company.Lose him? Sure, Nick. His 500 horsepower is no match for my 150.Maybe I should've spit on her arms.What the hell?Yeah, thanks, Gregory, we know. We're being chased by a crazy man and he just smashed into us!I'm not! The engine died!Why would you do that, Gregory?!I pay nineteen bucks a month for this fucking service!Oh, shit!I'm guessing you don't want toThat's crazy!That's Gregory, our On Star rep.I told you.Probably.Hey, Harken, one last thing?Your wife gives great head.Thanks, Margie. I just wanted to congratulate you on taking over Bobby's job.Yeah. Tough month for the Pellit family. Anyway, if there's anything I can do to help out before the baby gets here, please let me know.Your baby.Yeah, right. Look at that big belly.I... oh, my God.
