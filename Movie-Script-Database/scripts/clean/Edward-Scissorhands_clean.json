That's not true.That's not fair.There got to be.Yeah. Jim, the lights are on.You turned off the alarm. Am I right?I can't believe this is happening.He's never been here.No, Jim.

I tried to make Jim go back, but you can't make Jim do anything. Thank you for not telling them about me.It must have been awful when they told you whose house it was.You did?Well, then why did you do it?Don't.You could tell the truth.It wasn't my idea. You know I didn't want to do it.Dad!That is really stupid.Hey, how about after dinner we go down to the bowling alley? That will be fun.No.Well, think about it, you guys, I mean, that's the nicer thing to do. That's what I would do.I am being serious.

There's nothing to be upset about. No, no. It's okay.Now you stay in Kevin's room tonight. Tomorrow we'll fix your room right.Oh, honey, I couldn't have left him there all alone. You would have done the same thing.Oh, my goodness, Kim. I'm surprised at you. He can't help the way he is. Have a little sympathy.Then let's just say hello and later you can come downstairs and shake his hand.Well, not literally. Goodness, you scared him half to death.Hi, Bill. I just wanted you two to have a proper introduction. Edward, this is our daughter Kim. Kim, this is Edward who's going to live with us.Bill, you know what Edward told me? He had lunch at Jackie's today.She's just had her kitchen completely redone.New paint, new cabinets, new floors, new microwave, new Sonnet dishwasher.Isn't that something? Jim, didn't you tell me your mom had her kitchen done too?My goodness sake! I wonder what it's like to be that rich.Now, Bill. Margie made him cookies today.Honey, you want me to help you clean that up?It won't be long. She has just to decide on the style, and then it will be fine. She just has to decide what style she wants.We're getting the head of the company.Hi, honey. We're in here.Edward cut it. Isn't it wild? Hello. Oh, I can't believe I'm talking to you in person. This is such an honor. Yes. He's right here. Great. So then you know all about it. Aha. That's exactly what I've been using. Well, I've had a little trouble getting it to the right consistency. Yeah, right. just a little. I'll try that. Well, what imaginative suggestions! I sure will. Thank you so much. Bye bye. No wonder she's the head of the company. You know, she started out as a sales representative just like me. I've always wanted to talk to her but until now I never had a reason. Thanks, Edward.You bet she did.No matter what, Edward will always special.I've never seen that.Hi, Edward. Sorry. We had to go ahead without you. Here you go.Wouldn't that be great?You know. We already have a second on the house, but don't the testimonials make a difference? Did you see here, the mayor's wife can't wait to become a client?I can't believe it. Really, it's just an outrage. Don't you worry. This isn't the end of it. We'll get your money somewhere.But can we see him now?He has to stay in prison all night?Oh, Edward. Hello Edward, dear. I blame myself.Why don't I set a better example? You saw how I envied Jim's parents, their money.Oh, I blithely say, \"We'll get money for the salon somehow.\" But I never meant stealing. Stealing's not the way to get it. Stealing's not the way to get anything.Why ever did you do this?Edward. You stay here.He didn't want to talk.He can't talk right now.We have to get in the house. We don't want to talk to you. We'll talk to you later.Well, for goodness sakes, Lois, I'll see you at our Christmas party. Before I get you here for your haircut. Of course, we'll have it this year. Why wouldn't we have it this year? Well, you may think that, but you're wrong.Kim!Simmer down.You are not seeing Jim tonight?Honey, this is fascinating. but I don't think your father's finished yet.Oh, Edward, it does seem that that's what you should do, bit it's not.Oh, goodness sake, no wonder poor Edward can't learn right from wrong living in his family.Edward, do you want to give me that new haircut?yes, sure.It makes me proud to have you as my own personal hairdresser.Other people's feelings?A few manners? Just never you mind. Just you cut away. Cut away. It needs something else. What do you think, honey?More bells. Okay.Of course I think we should be having this party. Of course I do. I mean as just what we need is just to calm things down and then everything will just go back to normal. Do you have any more bells, honey?You...your father will find him this minute.All that blood, sweetie, and it's just a little cut.Oh... Uh...Oh, dear.I'm sure your father will find him soon.It's almost eight thirty. Great party, huh?So do I, honey. You know, when I brought Edward down here to live with us, I really didn't think things through. And I didn't think about what could happen to him, or to us, or to the neighborhood. You know, I think that maybe it might be best if he goes back up there. Because at least there he's safe, and we'd just go back to normal.Oh, dear. Oh, just... Well, let's get in the car and go look for him.He's Max'es.We'll be right back, dear.Kevin's all right! It was just the tiniest scratch! He's gone! Let's not bother him, all right?
