{"Brothers-Bloom-The": {"STEPHEN": {"raw_line": "Bloom, we've hit a one hat town.Sweet Jesus. Look at that.Pixie Stix.The playground bourgeoisies.Talk to her!What?Not a thing.A plan.And this is where we start.Oh - kay. How's it going on the playground front?So, on to step eleven, then. The Tale. You tell them -Bloom. They're not your friends. They're part of this, and this aint real. Remember, it's a con. And when it's done, we've just got us. And we'll be moving on. So, the tale. You tell them there's aThat's good. He stopped you coming home from school......if you can keep up...Ah-hah. The hermit didn't say. He got this greedy glinting look, the filthy red-eyed leech... and said he'd tell for thirty bucks.It seems to me that in the end, the perfect con is where each one involved gets just the thing they wanted.So how's it feel?Let `em melt.We're a genius, Bloom.So does real blood. Buy you a drink.\"Four months and a thousand years ago.\" That's Kipling, isn't it? He stole that from Kipling.Just think of any card. Got one?But if I do it enough, eventually it'll work on someone. And then it'll be the best card trick in the world.That's true.La Chinoise?Our fifth Beatle. She knows the ins and the outs, and so far as I can tell, speaks three words of English.Just till the wind changes.Who doesn't? That's the big 2.We missed the sunrise. That would've been nice.Back to the swamps!Then you make a show of putting on your jacket and say `no I mean it this time Stephen, this time I'm really out.'That's a major design flaw in fake blood, by the way.Real blood turns brown after a half hour.This scotch costs more than your suit.And the flask stopped a bullet from a black powder rifle at Appomattox.That's my new favorite camel.Tell me what you want.You want an unwritten life.Sorry bud. I'm dry.She's right, you know.Put on your face, let's eat.The Chink.How've you been?I've done a lot of thinking the past three months. You don't want out. You think you do but you don't. Here, c'mere. I want to show you something.New Jersey.Big money. Inheritance. Dad died early, Mom died two years ago after ten years fighting an illness that I can't pronounce.Look out.Stick with me.Penelope Stamp. Thirty three. Lived at home her whole life.She's bored, a seed in the snow. We're going to put her through a grand adventure, bring her to life.It's actually pretty simple. We're brothers, antique dealers, perusing the Americas for antiquities en route to someplace exciting via luxury steamer, say Greece. You tie into her and work your magic......and so that's how it ends, in Mexico, a burst of violence then a moment of truth on the beach. What do you think?This might not be something you know, but they've all been about you. Maybe that's why they've none of them been perfect, I've never been able to give you what you really want.I will never approach you to do another con again. Let's make it a red Schwinn.Wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk. Score to beat is 7.9. Keep your head in the game, the Chinese judge is tough.The Chink had it - I'm telling him, I know, thank you - in her report, I missed it. This is actually kind of great, I'll tell you why.Dostoevsky was an epileptic.His seizures were preceded by an enlightened euphoria, a sort of opening of his spiritual eye.You'll have two weeks on the boat.It isn't the talking that hooked her.Pleased to make your acquaintance. Bloom's told me about you, you're the epileptic photographer?This is my personal secretary and masseuse, Mrs. Yuengling.Heh. No. So what are your plans in Greece?Good for you.I was writing in a bar. And she doesn't drink, how does she know a Philly beer?Yes it was. Did he spot you?I invited him, sit down. This ship's too small to dance around each other for a week, we might as well have it out now. Bloom. Sit. Penelope, do you know our friend?We have a legitimate antique reselling business.We've gone straight, Max.We did. Eat your waffles.Were. We've been on the straight for three years. So that's that.Huh.Double Dutch Queens uses gaffed cards.Jesus.No. But something about her is worrying you plenty.The day I con you is the day I die, Bloom.He's beautiful, right?I'm not sure he is. I'm to bed.Shut up. I know what I'm doing.Have at thee, you ham headed bastards!A book of hours.Wonder who's his fence?Not bad.The Curator? That's a relative term. He's telling the truth.Take it easy. She's having fun, that's the point of this.What Smugglers Song?The whole point of this was to sweep her off her feet. Let her enjoy it.Nothing lasts.The last time I was in Prague, I was in love.Pale skin. Long feet. So.Bloom and I will secure us lodging,Mrs. Yeungling will scout the castle museum.You will go to the bank, that wire should have cleared if you put it in at Athens.Only movie thugs and Russians deal in suitcases of cash. Draw a certified check.Candy-Gram. It's us, Max.Today.Tomorrow. Now what about this Argentinian.We'll see you back at the hotel. Soon.I'm sorry I wasn't there.No, I guess can't.I'm a big fan of tonal shifts. I didn't write it for him, though.I don't know.Max?I don't get it. If he was hightailing it he could have waited eight hours till we traded the million for the book, and had some traveling money. Well. Back to antiquing. Nothing gained, nothing lost. And you got to see Prague, which is nice.Oh?The check was cashed yesterday afternoon, he'd have deposited it in a Swiss account. I'm sorry Pen.We'd need to clear the administrative offices. Some sort of disruption.She's an artist with nitroglycerin. It's kind of her thing.Check the tat.There's a smoke detector in these empty rooms in the east tower. So we plant and set off a tiny - TINY tiny, tiny charge.Ready?Ok.Because going in alone is a very important thing to do. She's walking into a zero security tourism office during a fire drill and taking a five hundred dollar manuscript replica from a utility crawlspace. Worst case scenario, a file clerk asks if she's lost. Which isn't even going to happen. She's in position.They're locking down the castle, she won't get in.Let her sleep. Train doesn't leave till eight.Yeah, I know.An apple?Mexico.Oh-kay. We're rendezvousing with Senor Rioso's guys here, on an isolated beach just south of the Mexican port town Tampico. A simple handoff. Penelope and Yeungling will stay with the car, Bloom and I will do the handing.Well I'm not thrilled they set this in Mexico. There could be legitimate reasons, but Mexico's - and I don't want to simplistically vilify an entire country, but Mexico's a horrible place. So we'll be careful.The last box in our last con. Let them begin the beguine. How's it feel?Uh huh.Be angry at me, you son of a bitch. Don't be pathetic. Make you? Jesus. I told you not to fall for her-I don't believe you.You have to switch it on at the base.Disappointed.It doesn't matter now. This is the way it ends. So let's get it over with.I ate it.No.I'm sorry you fell in love with her. But she's a mark. And all of this, all of it is a con. Every moment you shared with her, you were just playing the part of a man falling in love. That's what you're afraid of, right? That you don't know the difference? Or maybe that there is no difference. That that's what love is.No. You're too scared to leave. You're scared to ride off into a sunset that isn't painted tarpaulin, cause real sunsets are beautiful but they turn into dark uncertain nights. If you were ready for that, you wouldn't be here. The money is in my bedroom. Right behind me. But in my story you don't get the money or the sunset or the girl.Tastes like tin foil.Hey. I think that was the most honest conversation we've ever had. You actually connected on a few of those punches.I was disappointed. But I wasn't surprised.Hello?Uh... Nine-ish?So she comes back wanting to work with us. Honestly? I think we'd be lucky to have her. If you called me to hear my opinion on the matter. Which I'm getting the feeling you didn't.So maybe you want to tell me what I'm doing in Ferentino.One point seven five.You want me to plan a con whose sole purpose is to blow her off for good?Before we do the next job, we need to liquidate our assets from the last job.Your money from the last job, well that's profit, not capital, the three of us have already split it up. So step one: sell the book of hours.With all your random expertise we couldn't risk a flat out fake. It isn't worth two point five million, we could maybe catch four hundred grand for it, but it's real. Who'd we buy it from?Perfect, we'll sell it right back to him.All traceable. With Minskie out we'd have to go deep black market if we wanted to be a hundred percent clear. There's only one place that's deep enough for that.We're obviously not going to deal with real Russians. They'll be our guys in a phony set up, they'll take our phony book and give her phony cash, a closed loop. Safe and simple.Our \"Russians\" have arrived.Hm?We need someone who can pass for the Russian mob to buy our fake book. The Dog's got his big store right here in St. Petersburg.What's he gonna do? Steal our fake money? I've thought this one out, believe me. And we can't end it without him. Trust me. It's gonna be ok.This'll do. We'll do the drop off at your store. Make it scary, think a movie version of the Russian mafia, but don't hassle her.So. Our fake Russian attack. One small charge will simulate a bullet hit, and blow out the back window.Alright. Let's get the hell out of Russia.OUT!No! No Bloom, freeze.Did Penelope wire the money?They're calling to check right now. Don't move. I'm alright.Stay back!You said it, not me.Tastes like tin foil. Alright here's what I want you to do. The Chink split?How?Good. Here's what. Take Penelope back to Helsinki, take that flight to Rio. Lay low like we said. Play out the on-the-run-from- vengeful-Russians thing, that'll be fun for her. Play it like I'm dead, actually - that'll add some gravity to everything, that'll be nice. And I'll see you when I see you.I hope not. Last thing you need is me hanging around. Anyway, how could I top this?Hey. Think of any card.You're the only audience I've ever needed.Let's get the hell out of Russia.", "clean_line": "bloom ve hit hat town sweet jesus look pixie stix playground bourgeoisies talk thing plan

So whatcha thinking?Hi.It's great.Wait...I think I need more time to win their-hermit in the woods. A one eyed, steel toothed vagabond......with blood red eyes?...and told me of a cave.A cave of wonders.At noon on every Sunday, there appears a ball of light, which flutters like a butterfly...That's right. It guides you...to where the treasures lay.Yeah I guess so.Tastes like tin foil.No.Yeah.Did he tell you the cave story?What else did he tell you?Stephen took his eye out with an antique rapier.And then the Brothers Bloom lit out on their own to make their fortune as gentleman thieves. Sounds romantic.You want to know how Stephen did it? With Charleston?He positioned me in the same spot where, seven years ago, Charleston's wife stood and told him she was leaving.So in the end, everyone gets everything he wants.That's what he does, he writes his cons the way dead Russians write novels, with thematic arcs and imbedded symbolism and shit. And he wrote me as a vulnerable anti- hero. And that's why you think you want to kiss me. It's a con.`Do we have to go through this again.'Then you say `let's have a drink, and in the morning Bloom you'll have come to your senses'`and we'll be moving on.'Listen to me, Stephen.Listen to me.Listen.I hate you. I hate this life, I hate it, I hate that you won't fucking listen to me for one goddamn second. Just listen.Why? So you can write me a role in a story where I get it? You're not listening to me. I want a real... thing, I wanna do things how I don't know are gonna work out, a, I, want, a...I want an unwritten life! Aauuugghh god!Why are you here, Stephen?How'd you find me?How'd the Chink find me?Great.I'm quits, Stephen.Well lemme get my jacket.Looks like an etching from a Bronte novel.How much?What am I doing here, Stephen? I have one rule, and you've never even tested it.No women. One rule. You know we don't do women, I don't, and it's not a morality thing or- a thing- it's, whatever it is it doesn't matter what it is, that's just our rule. So what are we, Did you rent a `78 Caddy?An eccentric shut-in rich bitch. You're not helping your case.So this is the big plan. Lure me back into things with some beautiful intriguing elusive girl, stir up old memories with the prospect of redemption and rebirth. Seriously Stephen. Amateur night.You've got something up your sleeve. This is about me, right? Somehow.I want to be outta all this. So by definition, this is not going to give me what I want.There are less painful ways to cut into a mark.This is a banana seat, man!There's actually a knack to this. You want to avoid dying or breaking anything that won't grow back, but you don't want to roll out of it and come up roses. If you're trying to fast track into a mark's sympathies, there's nothing quite as efficient as having your first conversation be from a hospital bed they put you in. I usually like to try for a dislocated shoulder.You missed it?I know.The next step is to figure out a way to insinuate yourself into their personal life.Uh. Yeah.Bloom.Engagement. Find a connection with your mark through conversation.Nice area. Jersey.Having now deftly set your hook in the mark's psyche, this would be the perfect time to tug the line,Get invited in for coffee, and tell them the full tale.However, there are advantages to playing it cool. Letting it lie for a day or two, then casually re- establish contact....didn't really have anyone except each other growing up, and our father was in the antique business, he had a shop in Charleston. So we stuck together, my brother Stephen and me, we and just took over the shop when dad died. Then we realized one day, we saw the dealers who were finding and selling us the antiques coming from exotic countries all over the world, and there was a, almost a scent they had, when they'd come in the dusty shop we worked nine to five in since we were nineteen, the air would, like before a rain, the ions would line up, and you could just smell midnight trains to Paris and steamer ships and Calcutta bazaars, and we made the decision, we just did it, that we want to have that sort of life. So we did, and we've been travelling and treasure hunting the world ever since, and could you, I'm sorry, stop doing - that, you're, I'm, ok. Alright, look.I told you, that's alright. You want me to go?So what kind of stuff do you do?Alright. I'm just gonna finish my coffee first.Hm. Anything interesting?Is that it?You just learned this stuff, here by yourself?No. So you just thought, `so I want to learn this and this,' and you just did it? How do you plan to use all these skills?It's gotta warp the image though, right?It's a lie that tells the truth.What's changed between now and twenty minutes ago? Cause this is kinda like a conversation.Well, I should, uh, it's late. So. I meet a lot of people in my job I have to professionally act interested in. It's a good feeling to be genuinely interested in someone.Yeah.Well next time I'm in town. We're taking a steamer at noon tomorrow off the docks, to the continent for a few months.I need another day with her.I need another day to get her on the boat, she isn't hooked. That bit I skipped where we were talking in the backyard, it was ten minutes on the optics of lensless photography, we didn't really talk.I think you're wrong.Hi. What are you doing here?Yeah, I didn't want it, but thanks.Why did you decide to come?It just seems like a big leap. From where you were at yesterday to being a world traveler.A new hobby.Penelope, this is my brother Stephen.You named the Chink `Yuengling?'She knows a lot of stuff. Was that who I thought it was on the East deck this morning?Not yet.You look very nice.Lonely.How was it lonely?Well it's funny how everyone's usually got one.Wow.Do you feel cheated?I don't know, but he's carrying a knife up his sleeve and wearing a cape. Do me a favor and steer clear of him.Give me a minute.It isn't a Spanish band, but they'll do their best.The Chi-nese, uh, Yeungling? She found us.A few years back, when we hit the top of our art dealing game, she just appeared.Good.Also known in certain professional circles as the Curator.Eat your waffles, fat man.I know you like to throw those clever little details in, but you've gotta watch that shit with her Stephen. She had a lot of time alone in that house, and she used it. She did the best Double Dutch Queens I've ever seen up on the deck last night.She had them in her purse and cut them in while I was folding my napkin.That's what I'm saying. She's different, she knows, sometimes it feels like she knows everything. Doesn't that worry you?She feels like one of your characters.I know that. How did you get the Belgian, on our budget?I didn't expect him to actually be Belgian.Mine. Stephen always loved the life. Then he was almost killed on a run to Jakarta, two thugs with heads like canned hams worked him beyond all reason.And I called it, that was it.For me. Stephen enjoyed it. He loved the idea that we were internationally infamous art smugglers, but I think deep down, same as me, he felt like we were putting on a persona, faking it.He'd love to die on a job. Cornered at midnight on a run to Jakarta. That's his dream, to tell his story so well it fulfills itself. It somehow would make it finally real for him.Trying to get something real by telling yourself stories is a trap. Trust me on that one.My French is a little rusty, but I believe he just told you `my offer stands.'Oh lord. What has he got?That's what he does.Probably his Spanish guy, right? Did he say who's buying?I'm sorry you had to deal with that guy.Where's the train going?No.Well first off, we don't have a million dollars.This is real, it's dangerous, it could go very bad.This is not an adventure story.She's making a flag for our \"smugglers gang,\" man. She made me learn a secret smugglers handshake. Unhealthy. This afternoon, when she was writing, in the observation car? A letter? A journal? No. She is getting way too into this.You know, the one from whatsit, the Disney thing, that Smuggler Song, the `We're a band of smugglers hey, la la la la la, we smuggle by night and drink by day, smugglers ho, ho ho, smugglers...' there, this isn't... there isn't a Smuggler Song, is there? Ok. She made up a Smuggler Song. With hand motions.While it lasts.Fourteen gins? Are you kidding me?I'm not paying for that.She made up the Smuggler Song.Yeah.I usually drink with the Chink in the snack car, play cards.Mrs. Yeungling. That's her smuggler nickname.I think if it were offensive to her, she'd let us know.No.What?Look, I'm not-Nite.That's the big 2.Administrative offices. So how do you steal the book?Who painted it?Diamond Dog, carrying a cup and a cane.If I call Stephen down he'll kill you.Is this profundity? Cause you can skip it.Don't touch me.You're going to take your hand away or I'm going to break your arm, there's nothing between.You can't always be there.That was a real tonal shift. The Curator's tale.He made it up on the spot?We're a little early...Well at least he had the decency to just skip out on us, not do something tacky like fake his own death.You should stay in the city for awhile, they have these amazing puppet show opera things-It's my fault. I can't believe I left you alone with him.No. No no. Can't you see what happened here, there is no book, we've been swindled -It's not real, it's a con.The literal translation is something about water cranes, but essentially it means \"When you're done with something, blow it up.\"So straight down the corridor, again, tell me where.The abort code if we need to abort is \"corned beef.\" For some reason.Yeah.Horny?Alright?For the record, I'm still against this. Why send her in alone?Uh-Don't do it don't do it Penelope don't-Pen! Don't - abort! Corned beef! Corned beef!Wait. Wait, we're fine. She's fine. If the soldiers find her wandering the halls they'll assume she's a clerk, they'll just shoo her out. So as long as she doesn't do anything suspicious, she's fine.The Chief of Police.That was real.Fuckin scary.Yeah, but it was part of an epiphany.Yeah. You should sleep at the hotel tonight, I'll stay with Stephen at the beach house. You'll need sleep.Right now I am.She's something special, Stephen.Can I...I'm not gonna do this.I know what I've gotta do. I've gotta talk to you. Are you wearing shoes?My brother and I are con men. All things considered, we might be the most respected con man team working today. And everything since you hit me with your Lamborghini, all of this, it's all fake. It's all a con.No, we were going to blow you off tomorrow using the cackle bladder, it's a, term, we have actors playing the Argentina guy's men, when we showed up the deal would go bad, they would open fire on us, Stephen and I would pretend to be shot using blood packets, squibs. That's - cackle bladder, in the old days they put fake blood in chicken bladders, so... So you'd escape with the Chink, she'd send you off with a little travelling money and that would be that.But that's not how this one's going to end. I love you now, and I want to get you out of this. I'm going to do what I have to do to get you out of this, away from all this for good. Are you ready?Stephen's gone into town to prep the Argentina actors. Your money's at his place.C'mon.So I've told her our whole play. And I'm here. To take her money back. How's that make you feel?This isn't the ending you wanted?Where's the money?Give me the money, Stephen.He's not going to keep a single piece of you.I'm sorry.Did you expect me to do it? To come here tonight, end it the way you wrote it? Or were you really disappointed I didn't run off with her?I let you do your monologue, but you wanna know why I did it? I did it so she'd never want to see me again. To get her away from all this for good.Hey.How did you find me?How did you find the Chink?I didn't even know she had one.Why are you here, Penelope?Everything Stephen said that night was true.Go away. Everything Stephen said was true. I was just playing you as a mark. Everything between us, none of it was real.Pick up... c'mon...How quickly can you get to Ferentino?Alright.I did what I did in Mexico to get her out of all this. I would rather die than bring her into the con.You knew she'd come back. What did you figure she was good for, another million?We will play her again, one last con, but not for money. I'm gonna tell you how this one's gonna end. You built us into this, you're gonna fly us out, end it so she's done with all of us. End it all so it can't start up again.I love her. You owe me this. I don't want to turn her into me.Minskie.Well there's Demarco or Boyer. Or Roche, if we want to go state-side.Russia. It's like `cancer', I don't even like saying the word.Who'd you get, anyway?To play the \"Russians?\"I don't understand. Tell me so I understand. Three months ago you were ready to blind the old bastard-Alright, fuckin stop. You want this to finish in St. Petersburg, you want this to end with the Dog for some what thematic something? Fine but don't tell it like a story, let's say it. Twenty three years ago and I can still smell, that blood red apartment of his, the smell of that place. I hate him Stephen but this isn't that, this is I don't trust him.It's trash. There's visible cross hatching in Franklin's eye.Ok.You've been awful quiet.She gives the Dog the book, he gives her the fake money. This is taking too long.What happened?What happened?Where's Stephen?Who's got him?Stephen, god please what's happening. I don't know what to do. I don't know Stephen please. Please. What's happening. Please.If you know what's happening, now would be a really good time to speak up.Uh huh. Assholes. Ok. Um, ok. So I've got \"We are all assholes in our own theatrical enterprises.\" You sure?Shit head?I don't know.\"We're all of us marks in our own cons.\" And she said goodbye.That the Chink fell for a car bomb? Neither can I.Ok.This wasn't Russians. This was done by an old mentor of ours who wants us off the map. He has an apartment in St. Petersburg. So this is, yeah. I've gotta go back to that apartment to face the Dog and get my brother back. That's how I'm gonna end this.Thank Christ.If there are shots you run to the car and drive, with or without me.He's just an old man.Dog! I came back.Is that what that smell is?Ask him if anyone else is here.Ask him where the Diamond Dog is.Get the car started.It's alright.Get out! Get out of the car!!I'll wire the money from my account, and we'll go get Stephen.How much?How much are they asking for?Oh. Oh oh. No no NO.There's another possibility that I should of, I'm a fucking idiot. This might all be a con. By my brother. To get me - oh god - he wanted me to face the Dog, to end it, and he gets your money. Oh god. I'm going to be sick.I don't know. Yes. Yes of course he would.Son of a bitch.I'm so scared. Anything I can imagine finding in there, I'm scared of.Stephen!Stephen!Stephen. Game's up. Come on out. Let's blow this one hat town.Stephen, who is it? Is it the Dog?Yeah.No!Please tell me this is all gonna be ok. Tell me that's a squib, and that's makeup, and that you just gave me what I always wanted and pulled off the perfect con.You son of a bitch.Yeah. Clean exit.Car bomb.Soon?I love you.
