Don't be a nuisance, now. Good day.Give me my newspaper.My name is Denker. See? Denker. Perhaps you cannot read after all. What a pity. Good day.Listen, boy. I don't know what is the matter with you. But I don't have time for this game. Now, get out of here before I call the police.Fine.You get away from this house, God damn you! I'll beat you all the way home.You'll do no such thing.I'd be out of my mind to let an insane boy like you into my home.Is that what you want, to come into my home? So be it. There is no arguing with crazy people.My wife. She died in 1955 of lung disease. At that time I was working at the Menschler Motor Works in Essen. I was heartbroken.Stop that!Now I don't know what you're talking about.Denker. Denker. Denker. You don't listen, boy. The television has fried your brain.Yes, they're shaking. I'm old. We all shake. You are most tiresome, and rude. Now if you have a point I wish you'd come to it.You know nothing of my business --You have been following me?Perhaps for me you made an exception.Oh, yes, I see now. As I am this ex-Nazi fellow, as you say, then this must be the part where I offer you my hidden stash of gold, taken from the mouths of old Jewish men, of course, which I keep buried in the basement. Isn't that right, boy? Well, I'm afraid you're wasting your time. I have no money. If I did I might even give you some just to be done with this nonsense.Do you? Good for you.Your what?Yes, what are you telling me for?Accelerated?I see...Why do I care about this?I am sure you trouble your parents to no end.You told your parents about me, then?I think you're crackers, but go on. I'm riveted.What are you doing?All of this... because of a rain coat?You took photographs of me?Clever boy.You... put dust on my mailbox? For fingerprints? You took photographs of me? What else did you do?... I don't believe any of this.Bourbon.Would you care for a drink, boy?No Kok.Milk.Is that right?You should be a detective.Good Gott.You see? It's milk, boy. From Dairylee Farms. On the carton is a picture of a smiling cow....And two missing children. Boy what you have done, I have to explain this to you because clearly you don't understand, what you have done is a violation.Yes.That fucking name. Enough of that. I demand it.I demand --Boy, I will tell you this once more, and for the last time. My name is Arthur Denker. It has never been anything else. It has never even been Americanized. If you must know, and apparently you must, I was named by my father who greatly admired the stories of Arthur Conan Doyle. I did serve in the reserves, I admit, and in the late thirties, when I was first married, I supported Hitler. I supported him most, I suppose, because for the first time in years there was work and there was tobacco. ...Would you like a cigarette?Nicotine gum.Anyway, Hitler lost his mind at the end, directing phantom armies at the whim of his astrologer. He even gave his dog, Blondi, a death capsule. On May 2nd, 1945, my regiment surrendered to the Americans. I remember that a private named Gonzales gave me a chocolate bar. I wept.I was interned at Essen where I was treated very well. We listened to the Nuremberg trials on the radio and when Goering committed suicide, I bought half a bottle of schnaps and got drunk. When I was released, I put wheels on cars at the Essen Motor Works until I retired in 1963. In 1967 I emigrated here, to California, and became a U.S. Citizen. I am as American as you are.
