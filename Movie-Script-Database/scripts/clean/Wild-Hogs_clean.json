{"Wild-Hogs": {"DOUG": {"raw_line": "What \"stuff\"? This party isn't going to be fancy, is it? Just some friends and a wing platter from Costco?No you won't. Because I'm going to scrape the batter off.I went to medical school. You think I don't know how carbs work?Yeah, I can take him. There aren't any emergencies at the office this morning.I did do that. I forgot about that. I need to get some batteries in there. Because dentists do have emergencies. We are doctors, you know? We take the same oath. The oath of saving lives. Doug goes to take some of Billy's discarded Lucky Charms. Billy swats his hand away.You know, I use to race a car like this. Put a hemi under the hood... Nobody saw me coming.Yup. It could really... smoke some ass. Billy raises his eyebrows, impressed. Doug smiles. This was a good time to break the \"no saying ass\" rule.Yes, sir. They called it the dragon wagon. You're lucky to be in here without a helmet, pal. We both are. Doug downshifts a gear, and the tame engine roars artificially. Billy is impressed.Heck yeah, you can jam the radio. Doug tussles Billy's hair and smiles.Me? Oh, yeah. I've got a mouth right here in front of me. Doug takes a dental tool and hammers on the plastic mouth.Well, it's not attached to a head, really. More research. Doug hits the mouth too hard and all the teeth fall out. He fumbles to stop them from scattering everywhere.I don't know. Do you think we really need to stay at a hotel? I mean, Billy has his own room. Why don't we just buy new sheets? Like, hotel-colored ones. It'll be like the Ritz, but we won't have to pay to make phone calls!What? I'm just saying-- Suddenly, the speaker comes on overhead.Emergency?Acute molar abscess. That's going to need emergency surgery.Yeah.Taking it into the paint. Who's got the D? Whoop, too late, dudes! Booya! Doug jumps up to slam the ball, but only hammers it into the rim. The rim clangs loudly and the ball goes flying backwards. Billy's friends laugh a little. Doug notices.Well, that's not really my shot. I usually hit from downtown, you know? Doug grabs the ball out of the bushes and dribbles back to the three point line.That's where the big games get won. Back here from the three-- Doug swivels, jumps up and releases the ball. It heads towards the basket, then falls down five feet before it. It looks more like a pass than a shot. Billy hangs his head, humiliated.That was a pass, dudes! It wasn't. Doug nods with false confidence to the kids, stands there awkwardly for a moment, then quietly heads inside.I'm okay. I think I'm just going to go meet the guys for a beer.Guys! Come on. Let's go get a brew. I'm buying. Doug heads into the bar.Hey, Paul. PAUL laughs at his joke.Because it's Bike Week. That's our annual trip, Woody. We're Wild Hogs.Hey! She took an embroidery class for those. What has your wife ever made us?It's not a big secret, Bob. She's a swimsuit model. She's hot. I mean, so is my Kelly. She's very hot. Even after ten years. Not that I'm not still good looking... Doug looks at the guys. They don't respond.Because it's gay, or because I'm not?I don't know. Good, I guess. Is ten the silver anniversary?Aluminum? Like, siding? Yeah, that feels about right. Aluminum is sturdy, lightweight... recycled. Woody smiles and puts a map down on the table.We don't need a map for Daytona. We just follow the group. Woody takes a drink from his beer, then looks at the group with a mischievous fire behind his eyes.What?No, it's not. It's the slogan for the Downtown trolley.Well, what kind of trip are you suggesting? Another bike week somewhere?Well, Daytona isn't the \"backbone of America,\" but it is a tradition. We've been riding with this club for years. Do we really want to miss out on that? One of the bikers, KENT, approaches carrying a box.Look, We'll talk about it tomorrow. But we don't need some trip to go \"live.\" Weoh.Oh, man. There should be laws against that... Is Fred having a seizure?Hey, we have fun all the time. But I'm not going to let myself look like that. He wears dress socks with shorts, too. I've seen it. Do you want me to do that?He's drunk. We should do something.--No, he's fine. Let him talk.No, no. No cheers-- Because that wasn't an accurate toast. I'm still the same, shitty son-in-law I used to be.So what are you saying?Hey, I'll dance! It's just this music is lame. People like me need a fresh beat! Doug walks over to the stereo and changes the station. \"Cand Sho \" h y-50 Cent starts playing. Doug nods along with the beat, as the guests all now stare at him.Awwww, yeah. This is the shit! It ain't 1980 anymore, man. Yeah!What!? I thought this was what you wanted? I'm dancing! Doug starts grinding and shimmying to the beat. Kelly grits her teeth.Come on, baby! Just because we're married ten years doesn't mea n we're old people. Let's dance! It fee ls goooood! Doug makes another spastic dance move, then suddenly grimaces and grabs his chest.Nope, that feels bad--Yeah. I'm just-- Ow: That's-- Yeah, I should go to the hospital-- Doug staggers across the carpet as people run to help him.Dr. Matthews, actually.Stress-induced? I'm not stressed.I'm not middle-aged.I am middle aged, aren't I?What?I don't know. There's just a lot weighing me down these days, you know?I still have a thirty--We are going to be married fifty more years, Kelly. I'm going to find old Doug. I just have to figure out where to look. Kelly takes a breath, and pulls out a map. She hands it to Doug, who looks at it.Woody's map?I thought you agreed it was a bad idea.Really? I only got you an ankle bracelet.Yeah, I'm okay. Just stress.Bob. Let's forget about Daytona Bike week. Let's ride across U.S. 50.Yeah. I think that might be okay.Wow. That's...You're not wearing a helmet?You will if your head falls on it.Well, if we're going to make it in five days, we'll should probably get to Illinois by tonight.I do. I have this little GPS system. Doug shows them a handheld GPS system. Woody grabs it and throws it into a storm drain.Hey! What the hell, man? That was expensive!Hah! How's that feel? Woody gives Doug a long look, then slowly smiles.So we're not even going to talk about this? I mean, shouldn't we at least--Dudley? You're supposed to bury that.This is really nice, you know? Chilling by the fire with your best friends. Just relaxing, and enjoying----each other's company... Dudley grabs the bag and heads off.Yup... These are the times we'll remember. After a minute, Doug turns to Woody and Bob.Hey, when was the last time you guys heard me sing Bon Jovi?Yeah, I know. Turns out there's carbs in the batter. Hey, you know what? Maybe carbs are what I need to get old Doug back.No. I think I've lost me. It's this thing Kelly said.A wimp?No. I just thought that was what you were... I thought you wanted us to guess, and I didn't have a guess, so I said \"wimp.\" Knowing it was wrong...Yeah, I guess life just isn't as simple as it was when we were in college. Well, except for you, Woody. You're still living the fairy tale. Swimsuit model wife. Big job at an investment firm. You've got the good life. Woody doesn't respond. He just stares vacantly into the fire for a beat.We know, Bob.There's a surprise. Doug pulls a flaming marshmallow out of the fire.All right, who wants their marshmallow well-done? The guys just look at it.Yeah, I left that one on too long. Doug flips the stick and the marshmallow goes flying behind him. The guys don't notice - but we see the marshmallow land on the tent and continue to burn. Bob continues to huff on the air mattress. He stops and looks at it.Shit! The tent-- Doug and the guys jump up and hurry over to the tent.Dudley, get the water jug off my bike! Dudley hurries over to Doug's bike as Doug and Bob try to smother the flame with sand.It should be okay. It's fire retardant. The guys try and extinguish the flame as Dudley comes running with a jug. He quickly takes off the cap. Doug notices him.Dudley, no! That's\u0097 It's too late. Dudley is already throwing it on the fire. The liquid hits the tent and it explodes into flames. The guys shield themselves.Gas! That's the spare gas tank, Dudley! Dudley doesn't know what to say. The fire quickly disentergrates the tent. Doug, Bob and Woody just watch, knowing there's nothing they can do. After a moment, DUDLEY runs back up with the correct water jug and empties it on what is now a flaming pile of ash. It does nothing.That was all of it, Dudley. That was all the water we had.Yeah. Yeah, just on a road trip.Okay, well... Thanks for stopping. Have a nice day, officer. The highway patrolman laughs.Please put your pants on.Skivies? What are you, a Newsie?I guess I get that.I will find old Doug! Doug smiles and throws his shorts on the shore. Dudley smiles, takes off his briefs and holds them up.Um... Well, we're just taking a dip. IWe should go.You guys have to shift every once in awhile. Blood has to circulate. A MOMENT LATER. Dudley and Bob are up and wiggling their sleeping limbs, as Woody looks up at the bar.Look at these bikes. They're all classics.Yeah, but why didn't he customize it? You have a 51 panhead and you don't chrome out the exhaust? Or airbrush an eagle on the gas tank? What a waste.Well, not a gang. Just friends. Friends that ride... you know.Dudley, maybe you should--All right, guys. We get the joke... Good one. Anyway, we actually should get moving along.All right. We respect that this is your turf, and we're sorry for bothering you. But we can't head back without my friend's bike. So clearly we're going to have to work something out here. Jack looks back at the Hells Angels and nods.The trip's over, Woody. Let's just head back home.That's the point, Woody. Our lives aren't on this highway. They're back home. We have families, jobs, wives... or cats... We're not going to piss off a biker gang. We're going back. Woody takes this in, gritting his teeth in disappointment.Come on, Woody. You don't want to take this risk. You have Claudia, and your job... You have a great life back home.You really said that?--I can't feel my nuts, Woody. And Kelly still wants another kid. DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY head inside the motel office.Woody, your headlight doesn't even work.Did you inhale exhaust fumes? Because something is happening to your brain. I think it might be retardation.Whatever, Corky. Doug shrugs Woody off and dials his cell phone.Yeah, I'm having a great time. No old Doug, yet, but I haven't gotten sun- burned... Woody looks at Bob.I can't believe you made us leave so early. You really wanted to see the sun rise?Come on, Woody. It looks like a neat town. And Dudley's got another bag of poop to throw away. Dudley nods. Woody grits his teeth as they enter the town. It's a quiet, one stop-light town - with an old fashioned main street and town square. We see a banner over the street advertising a block party that night. It's a postcard version of small town America.Wow. Lucas is a polite town.well, how could we pass through this town without stopping? Everything looks so perfect.Excuse me? MAGGIE runs up and guides her Dad away from the guys.Are there any booths open? All the people quickly jump out of their booths.You like the waitress, huh?Mmmm. I'll have what he's having. Maggie nods obediently and takes the man's plate. She slides it in front of Doug.No, uh... I'll take a new one. He can keep his.Hey, it's okay. Really.Hey, guys. This block party tonight looks cool. Music, grilled corn, dollar beers, funnel cakes.Not another one of these assholes. Murdock hears this and whips around to see the Wild Hogs.Oh, I was actually referring to some guys we met at a bar about two hundred miles east of here. You're probably notUs? Oh, no. We're from Cincinnati. Bud calls out to the kitchen.No. We're Wild Hogs. That's our gang.Weren't you just hiding in the kitchen?Well, now he is.Well, Woody is the one who really--Nice. Now the paraplegics can park down the block and get more exercise.Wow. That's fantastic.Those guys are that big of a problem, huh?And the police don't do anything?Sure. Let's do it.Okay. Of course you get a vote. Woody nods and looks at Bob and Dudley. They clearly intend to stay.But you didn't plan the voting system. I did. So you only get one. Sorry. Doug, Bob and Dudley walk off. Woody fumes.These people love us. This is nuts.Well, let's not get too carried away with it. The truth is we're just regular guys. Let's not forget that.He's waiting for you to say something else, then he's going to kick you. Dudley gets a deflated look and backs off of Woody.It doesn't get any better than this, huh? Bob notices Doug getting ready to chomp down on a piece of garlic bread.Thanks, Bob. You saved me from all that... buttery, garlicky flavor.I hope you choke on it. CHARLEY approaches with his two deputies, EARL DOOBLE and BUCK DOOBLE. They are chubby, thirty-year old twins - identical in every way, except for the fact that Buck is missing an ear on the right side of his head... which the skin has scarred back over. It doesn't look good.Well, it's nice to meet you guys. You've got a great town here.Or Thomas Milborn.Yeah. I think he really likes that girl.Ahh, just to escape for a bit.Yeah. Apparently I've lost him. I don't sing Bon Jovi anymore.I don't think we need to. I mean, we can have our own test of manhood. Let's see how many ears of corn we can eat or something. I'll start. Doug grabs an ear of corn and takes a bite, but Woody just grins with that reckless look in his eyes.Wow. Um... Woody? This was your idea, so... go ahead. Woody nods.All right. I'm in. I'm slapping that bull. The guys cheer as Doug climbs over the fence and starts heading towards the Bull. The group all leans on the fence, watching.Wheeeeew!! Yeah! Doug runs across the field, but the Bull - now fully alert - swivels with magnificent agility and breaks into an angry charge towards Doug. The guys all watch in horror as the Bull quickly gains on Doug. Doug sees the fear on the guys faces and looks back over his shoulder. His smile quickly turns to terror.Ahhhhhhhh! It's too late. The Bull catches Doug and bucks him into the air. Doug flies ten feet and comes crashing down on the muddy grass. The Bull takes a few steps back and starts lining up another charge at him.We just slapped the bull! The group high fives each other in congratulations, and starts away: Bruised, muddy and laughing. ANGLE ON: THE BULL. He pushes on the gate that Charley was holding open. The gate swings open. ANGLE ON: WOODY, BOB and DOUG. They walk with Charley and the Dooble brothers, laughing and carrying on.Hey, Dud. You look happy.You have a sister?I thought you said the color ipod was your soulmate.Come on. Let's go back to the hotel. We've got to get up early to do some fishing. The guys start walking towards the Main Street hotel.Open road, baby!Are you kidding me? Woody, you're going to have to talk to these guys again. Get them to leave this town alone--Woody!? What the hell is wrong with--Live!? We're going to die, Woody! You burned down their bar! We are dead men!Sorry? That's it!? You're sorry!?Why? It's just a stupid vacation!This trip is just you running from your life. Your miserable, screwed up life.It doesn't mean anything! It's just a patch my wife made!! Doug, Bob and Dudley look at each other. After a moment, they look over to the sidewalk and see: ALL THE TOWNSPEOPLE, staring at them in disappointed silence. Slowly, the townspeople turn and quietly head back to their homes. Doug, Bob and Dudley lower their heads in disgrace. So much for being heroes.You think?Thanks, Charley. Charley and the Dooble brothers look a little surprised.They're still out there. Passed out.Bob, we can't leave. They'll just stay here and keep terrorizing this town.For what? To be stationed here permanently? Because these guys will just come back when they're gone. And it'll be even worse.We've created this problem, Bob. We've got to think of a way to solve it.Tell her \"no,\" Bob. Bob looks uncomfortable at this thought.Well, you're going to have to, Bob! We're not going to screw over an entire town because you're afraid of women! Bob stands up, insulted.You know, you can storm out too, if you want.Thanks, man. Doug smiles and gives Dudley a squeeze on the shoulder. Dudley is clearly disappointed, having assumed Doug would tell him to go see Maggie. Dudley just stands there, silent.You okay?Hey, Bud. Look, I'm sorry we got your town in all this trouble. This trip was supposed to fix problems, not cause them.What do you mean? Bud smiles and looks out at the kids playing.You're right. That's why I stopped singing Bon Jovi. Life used to be a risk. That was old Doug. And now it's gone. I've taken away all the risk.It's not. And I have a will, now. So, I only have so much livin' left. And somehow I've lost the best part of it.These are worms.I don't get it.What's that have to do with worms?Hey. Going fishing?I've got worms.Um... Look, man. I'm sorry about Claudia. And the job.But, you shouldn't have lied to us--You would have stormed off right then, huh?Well, what's the point of being in a motorcycle gang if we can't ourselves in a little trouble? Woody looks back at him. Doug smiles a little bit.It'll be okay, man. Woody smiles a little as well.Yeah. We won't die. I don't think.Well, the good thing is we'll be able to know for sure. That'll be cool.Did you bring the paddles?Why were you here?Hey, Bob. Worms? Bob looks at the styrofoam cup and nods.Were those the only two paddles?Oh. Bob sits down on the grass.Well, we can change that. Bud laughs as the guys enter the house.He's with you, isn't he?Dudley has mine. I'll just call him.He needed to call his answering machine so his cat could hear his voice.Yeah. And the girl wasn't even smiling - she just had a cleft lip.Nope. The Hells Angels have him. Doug gives a look to the other guys. They mouth \"Shit:\"No they aren't. We're going to get him back.No. Nobody is paying anything. Everyone stops and gives Doug a puzzled look. He has a new fire behind his eyes. His suburban quietude has transformed into something more... valiant.We're not calling the Highway patrol. We're not gathering ten thousand dollars. We're going over there and getting our friend back.It's not. But sometimes you have to do the things that aren't safe, to create a world that you're happy being in. These Hells Angels don't want our ten thousand dollars. They want our dignity. They want us to be afraid of them just like this town is. And once they know we're afraid, they can do whatever they want. That's how these guys exist. That's how they ride into this town and tear it to pieces... Because people want to keep their lives safe so badly, they give up the best part about it... Doug takes his Wild Hogs jacket and pulls it on..The adventure. Doug looks at Woody and Bob. Woody smiles and pulls on his jacket.Where's Dudley? Jack turns back and nods at one of the Hells Angels. They push DUDLEY forward. We see he is now completely cocooned in duct-tape - like a mummy. There is only a small slit for his mouth and eyes.Just hold tight, Dudley.We're not giving you any money. Jack looks surprised.We're not going to play your games. We're all adults, here. It's not highschool. I'm sorry your bar got burned down, and we'll be glad to help you get it rebuilt, but we're done being bullied by you. Now give us back Dudley, and get out of this town. The Hells Angels start to laugh. Jack turns back to them and smiles, \"Can you believe these guys?\" Doug is starting to lose his cool.Give us back our friend, asshole! The Hells Angels are suddenly silent. Jack turns back and looks at Doug in disbelief - then rage. Doug starts to look a little worried.Ass... hole.Wait!! Wait a minute! The Hells Angels stop.Yeah. But not just for Dudley. If you win, we'll give you ten grand and go back home. You'll never see us again. But... If I win, you let Dudley go and you never set foot in Lucas again. This town is off limits to the Hells Angels. Forever.Well? You in, or are you too much of a bitch? The Hells Angels freeze. Jack grits his teeth in rage and turns back to Doug.Great. Doug nods, trying to look confidant, but it's quickly fading away.All right. When do I hit back?Ow! Dammit Jesus that hurt!Yes!-- But Doug is instantly punched in the stomach by Jack's other fist. Doug winces as he doubles over in agony. Drool drips out of his mouth. This isn't pretty. Jack takes him by the back of the shirt and lifts him into the air. The Hells Angels cheer as Jack tosses Doug five yards into the dirt.Hah! Doug whips around and throws the sand towards Jack's face; However, his aim is off. The sand hits Jack in the chest and falls away. Jack looks at Doug and shakes his head.Damn. Jack punches Doug square in the face again. Doug crumples to the ground in pain. Jack turns back to the Hells Angels.Ahhh! Doug throws another handful of sand. This time he aims carefully; but Jack now has sunglasses on. The sand bounces harmlessly off the lenses. Doug cringes and waits for the punch, which comes like a freight train into his stomach. Doug doubles over again as Jack lines up another punch.Wait! Wait-- Doug straightens up and looks curiously at Jack's mouth.Your tooth-- That's an acute periodontal abscess.look, I really hate you, but I don't want to feel responsible for a death. I'm a dentist. I took an oath. Same one as doctors. If the infection in that tooth gets to the root - it could seep into your nervous system. Just let me look-- Doug slowly reaches towards Jack's mouth. Jack doesn't move.Yeah. One of the best. And I know when your gums are that swollen and yourYou still don't get it do you, Jack?We are the real bikers. As Doug says this, Dudley kicks the Panhead into gear and shoots forward - out of control. He instantly crashes into a steel light post. Everyone in the crowd cringesAhh, we should be heading back. I think we've had enough excitement for one trip. Earl steps forward and shakes Doug's hand.You guys ready to head back?You are?Hey, baby. What are you doing here?I hadn't really decided. I have been having a good time, though.You'll see him even more if you and Billy meet me in San Francisco. We've got a suite at the Ritz-Carlton. Doug smiles and gets onto his motorcycle. Kelly looks concerned.Ahh. We can risk it. Kelly smiles and kisses him proudly. Doug grabs her face and kisses her back...

right now, so... The door behind him flings open, and KAREN LEVENSTEIN, attractive and harsh-looking, steps in holding a phone.I know, I was just trying to make thisActually, I need to talk to you--If that's about the party, you--Well, I really have to finish my--You bought this shirt for me. I was fine with my t-shirts--What?Well, I have to get another--You going to wear that?You're cool with the carbs? Doug pauses, without turning around.What are you talking about? This place is cool. We're with other bikers.Sorry. I didn't... Don't tell her.Well, Kelly must still think you're hot. Ten years, man. How's that feel?I don't know, man.Doug! Are you okay?Oh, man. Thank god.Oh, she's waiting in the parking-- SFX: A loud honk from the parking lot.That's her. Bob looks out the window nervously. Kelly looks at Doug.Yeah? Are you sure? I mean, We'll be leaving behind everything we're used to. SFX: The horn honks again from outside.A tattoo? You got a tattoo?Yeah, the way I mapped it out - we should be a hundred miles past St. Louis by sundown.He's right, Doug. Wild Hogs! Bob takes his cellphone and throws it in the storm drain.Yup. Bob starts his bike.This is more comfortable. I wish Karen would have let me buy the foot pump, though.It's been awhile. You're not as obnoxious as you used to be. You used to eat a lot more buffalo wings, too.I know what you're talking about. I lost old Bob, too. I think my wife and daughters killed him. I'm surrounded by women every minute of my life. And it's made me, you know...What? No. I was going to say miserable. You think I'm a wimp?You know, it's not always so bad. Like, when Karen sleeps, she still crawls over and pushes up against me. Just snuggles right up like she needs me. I like that. I like that a lot. Then the sun comes up and turns her into a raging she-demon.Hey, Dudley. You've got us, buddy. And you're going to get a woman, too.I told you we were going to hit some strip clubs when we get back.Dudley-- Please. I'm trying to help you here.Please! Strippers are nice to me!Thanks, man.I think I'm half way there.Thanks for waiting for me, jerks. The guys look up to see that Bob is naked. He smiles and cannonballs into the water.Whhheew: Yeah! That's c-c-cold: He sees DOUG, WOODY and DUDLEY are just staring at him.What?We're swimming. You guys kept on your skivies?I don't know. We took showers and stuff together in college. I thought this was kind of... you know, the same.You think? They're gone, now.Dammit! Leg's asleep. The guys go to help Bob up, as Dudley gets off his bike and falls to the ground.Oh, man. Check it out. A 1951 Panhead. You know how rare this thing is? The guys all crowd around the bike.Hells Angels, huh? You guys are legends. I'm surprised we've never seen you in Daytona. The bikers kind of chuckle to themselves. The leader of the gang, JACK, steps forward. He's in his late 40's - and looks like he could break you into bite size pieces.What? Are you nuts?Seriously?Yeah, I actually agree with you on this one. Let's not call wives.Hey! Let's stop for breakfast, I'm starving.I just said I was--That's how these little towns are. It's unspoiled America.Wow. Everyone is so nice, here. The guys sit in one of the booths. Dudley hangs back, and struggles to talk to Maggie.Wow. That wasn't funny.What schedule? You said we're taking this trip to live. Let's stick around and live a little. Have some small town fun! Woody goes to protest again, but Dudley stands up.I'm not a wimp, pal'. I'm a man! You got that? Huh? You got that!!No, you know what? This guy needs a talking to just like his friends did, Woody.Let me do this, Woody! You stood up to them last time, and I just sat there like I always do... Well, not this time! Listen, you piece of shit. You think you can just walk around and bully perfectly nice people? You think that's how it works? Well, guess what? This is the real world. With real laws and real consequences. You hear me!? Bob swats Murdock's beer out of his hand. It spills all over him. Murdock is too filled with rage to speak.Now get out of here! And if that gang of inbred assholes needs things explained to them again, tell 'em the Wild Hogs will be right here in Lucas tonight. Woody puts his face into his hands.Now get. Murdock just stares daggers at him.Get! Bob kicks the stool out from under Murdock. He almost falls, but catches himself on a stool. He glares at the guys, but he's outnumbered. He grits his teeth and storms out the door. Woody winces to himself as he watches Murdock go. This isn't good. After a moment, BUD comes running out from behind the bar.Hey-- we should probably share the credit. I mean, I just basically kicked that guy's ass. Man! You know how good that felt!? Yeah! Bob punches a handicapped parking sign, which rattles against its post, then falls to the ground. Bob immediately looks regretful.Should I fix it? Oh, man. I should.You ride this?Yeah. They think we're bad asses.It's true. He was unclogging his bathtub drain and the cat thought it was a ball of yarn. Doug and Woody wince. ANGLE ON: DUDLEY, at the beer tent. He gets in line, and realizes he's behind MAGGIE. She smiles at him.That's a lot of carbs. Doug stops, mid-bite, and puts the bread down.Well... Still a nice town.Yeah. This is good for him.Hey! Leave him alone! You want some of this!? Come get this! Bob sprints out into the field. The bull snorts and starts towards him. The Bull closes on Bob quick, but at the last moment Bob dives of the way. The bull goes flying past him.Hah! Missed me, you fat bastard!Did you see me? I dodged him! I dodged that stupid cow! How cool am-- Suddenly, the Bull charges into the fence, which Bob's butt is sticking through. Bob goes flying and lands face down in the dirt. He scrambles back up, furious.You son of a bitch! You want to keep it going!? You want to take cheap shots!? Come on! Bob tries to climb back into the pasture, but the guys restrain him.I'm going to go back there with a rifle tomorrow and shoot one of his legs off. Then we'll see who's tough.Because I want to kick him in the face. Doug and Woody laugh again. Bob just steams. They spot DUDLEY, and head over to him.Wild Hogs ride! The guys continue with enthusiastic cheers as we hear the off-screen rumble of engines. Doug looks down the street and sees: THE HELLS ANGELS. All forty of them are riding into town - and the guys will be in their view any second. Woody is frozen with fear.You son of a bitch! Bob lunges at Woody, but the sudden shifting of weight is too much for the port-o-potty...It got in my hair! Gross! The guys desperately try to rinse off the juice - then, drenched from head to toe, turn their glare to Woody.You did! You're a stinking liar!Well, I talked to Karen. She going to fly out here, rent a mini-van, and pick us up. We'll just ship the bikes back later.So what? They can call the National guard or something.Well, Karen is really insistent she come drive us back.I can't do that.Oh, sorry I'm not brave like you, Doug! The guy who gets injections in his scalp so he won't go bald! Bob storms out the back door of the police station. Dudley looks to Doug, curiously.Hey, guys.Are we all good?Shit. Hold on.You guys'll drift in.That's it. He's never had a girlfriend so he's probably getting carried away. He once drank eighteen Mocha Latte's because the Starbucks clerk was smiling at him.No way. They said no law. We can't risk them doing anything to Dudley.I'm going to call Karen and have the cash wired out of our savings.Let's go slap the bull. Doug smiles and taps fists with Bob and Woody.Yeah, Doug!Alright, Mother f-- Bob suddenly trips on the lead pipe and hits the ground. Doug shakes his head.I'm in, too! Let's ride to San-- Suddenly, a mini-van pulls up. KAREN and KELLY hop out.Um... Actually, we just decided we were going to keep pressing West for a few----Karen! Karen stops talking, shocked by Bob raising his voice.Listen to me. This is My vacation and if I want to ride on with my friends, well that's what I'm going to do! And if you have a problem with that, well... Tough shit! There's a moment of silence as Karen absorbs this. The guys all look at Bob proudly. After a few seconds, Karen's face softens.I will. And... I love you. Bob smiles at her and gets on his bike. ANGLE ON: DOUG and KELLY.

You're not going to push me around. We agreed on a price, and that's the price I'll pay. If you don't like it, walk away... but you can kiss your business good bye, because that's what happens when you screw with Woody Stevens. You go down. Hard. As Woody talks, he passes by framed magazine covers of a beautiful model, as well as some pictures of his wedding day with her, their exotic vacations, and one blownup glamour shot of Woody, shirtless, oiled and holding a greasy wrench..No, money's not the problem Money's never a problem. You just need to honor the correct price. Got it? Woody gets his answer, and angrily throws the headset down on a stack of moving boxes. He marches to the front door and throws it open..Then go home, Toby! You make me sick! ANGLE ON: The front yard. A ten-year-old boy is standing with a rake, surrounded by leaves. He clicks off his cellphone and shrugs.Well, you should have thought of that before you put the \"any yard for ten bucks\" flyer on the telephone pole. You're done on this block, now. And that goes for your band fund-raisers, too. I'm not buying any candy bars no matter what parade you dorks have to get to! Woody slams the door closed. Toby kicks at a pile of leaves, then starts home.I noticed that. And if you ever lay your head on my back when you're riding bitch again, I'm going to throw you into traffic.I felt you smell my hair!Man, I wish we could find a place that wasn't so freaking lame.Yeah, Paul. I'll talk to you about it on the trip.This place sucks. Why are we going to Daytona with these posers?We're not Wild Hogs. That's a patch your wife made and we all had to sew it on our jackets so she didn't feel bad.Hey!?We're not going to say you're hot, man.There's no non-gay response to that.Point proven.--And ready for the trip of a lifetime. The guys look at the map, puzzled.Not if we don't go on the Daytona trip.Guys, listen to me. It's time for a change. Let's go on our own trip this year. Just us, like it was in college. Forget these guys. Forget Daytona beach. Bike Week is just corporate white guys playing dress up. This bar is, too. And we didn't get into this to play dress up - we got in this to live. \"Be cool and Ride free.\" That's the Wild Hog creed.I know. But, it works as our creed, too. So let's live it!No. That's dumb, Dudley. Let the big people talk.No. That's the best part. We don't do some planned out trip. We follow the open road. U.S. 50. The backbone of America. We take a week and go all the way to San Francisco. Think about it, guys. Camping out, stopping wherever we want, whenever we want... Just freedom. When was the last time we had that? The guys consider this, but look sceptical.You're afraid to ask your wife.Nape. I don't want anything between me and the road, man.Look, the only rule on this trip is to have no plan. We're riding to San Francisco, and nothing else is planned. Just riding free.What? No. No plan. It's the open road. Who knows where we'll be.I did it for the good of the trip, Doug. You don't need GPS to discover America. We just need the wind, our bikes, and freedom. And if we have an emergency, I always have a cell phone-- Woody takes out a cellphone. Doug grabs it and throws it in the storm drain.It felt good. It felt damn good.Yes. Go bury it.Don't hang it on a tree!Oh, man. Thank God that stopped.Old Doug? You've lost your Dad?You're a wimp, Bob. I'll say it. You're afraid of girls. It's embarrassing. Dudley comes up and sits back down.You're afraid to talk to one. Bob is afraid they'll kill him in his sleep.I'll go, too.In just one hour.Why are you naked?No, we're not. Don't say that. Doug wiggles his boxers off and holds them in the air.I will be naked with my gay friends, and if they look at my jock, I will kill them. Woody throws the boxers to shore. The guys all look at each other and smile. It's a nice moment. Until a family approaches. Doug looks at the other guys, wide-eyed, as a family with three young kids walks up with a picnic basket. The young kids run and jump into the water. The Dad of the family laughs and shakes his head.There's a shallower spring up the path. The kids might like that even more... The Mom lays down a blanket and turns to the guys. The Dad is still staring, not sure what to do.Yeah, we could stay another few--Now this is the best part of any road trip. Seeing our brothers on wheels. Look at this place. America! The guys look at it and nod. It is a cool looking shack of a bar. Doug admires the row of motorcycles out front.Probably no good custom stores out here in hick-land. We'll leave 'em a catalog. The guys push open the door and step into the bar.No, I don't. Doug does. I think it's great the way it is. Doug glares at Woody incredulously. Woody shrugs.Anybody else got that \"pre-rape\" feeling?All right. Let's just give them a few minutes to get back inside - then shoot right past them.We're going to turn back after all these miles? Just because some fat bully's pushed us around?Good. See? Dudley's got some balls.I can't believe you guys. What a bunch of pussies. The whole point of this trip is to live, man.You're right, I do. But maybe I should talk to those guys one more time. I mean, I'm an executive at an Investment firm. I've made a career out of convincing people and these are just people. You guys wait here. Woody starts up his bike. Doug and Bob look at each other and shrug. Dudley hurries out of the sidecar.They're cool with it. We can press on.Yup. I tried to be polite. I tried to reason. I told them Dudley was dying.Well, technically we're all dying, Dudley. Just very slowly. Dudley looks concerned.Anyway, none of that worked. So I laid it out for them. I said, \"Hey, go ahead and assault us. Because we might be not be real bikers, but we know real lawyers. And the moment you touch us is the moment you get your ass sued. Because this is the real world - with real laws, and real consequences.\" And they backed down. The guys are impressed.Yup. And I think they'll give us Dudley's bike on the way back, so let's go. Quick. Before they change their mind. Woody quickly starts his bike and rides on. The guys shrug, impressed, and follow him. After a moment, we see them all speed by the bar.No, we're not stopping here. Riding at night is half the fun. Let's just keep--So, adopt a kid. You already have two white ones, anyway. The guys ignore him. Woody looks back down the highway uneasily, then heads inside the motel office.You think I won't ride without light? I can feel the road. Let's go. I'll even race somebody. Who's racing me?I just want to ride. Let's go!You're calling Kelly? You're not aloud to call wives on a road trip.You agree with me, right?Are you kidding me? I have to leave. Let me know when lame hour is over.No, I'm not calling Claudia. I mean, yes I want to, but I won't. Because I'm on a road trip with my pals. And cell phones aren't even allowed! Woody storms out. Doug hears something on the phone, and lights up.Yeah, man. It warms my heart, with it's...What!? No! We're not hungry yet.You're not! Fatty! Bob looks hurt. Doug gives Woody a stern look.It's a shithole. Let's keep moving. The guys ignore Woody and enter the diner.Okay, we'll get it to go, then. We can ride and eat if it's wrapped in a tortilla. Woody gets no response. He looks back down the road, uneasily, then follows the guys in.Not a big deal.No, no, no, no. We have a schedule. San Francisco is waiting.--Oh, we're just a group of friends. No big deal. Your guys gave us permission to pass by, so it's all good.Bob, let's not get carried away--But, Bob. I don't think--Can't you call a bigger town or something for backup?Oh, thanks, but we're actually moving on--Uh uh. No, I'm putting my foot down, here. I still get a vote on what we do, you know? And I want my vote.I actually get three votes. Because I planned the trip.You know what? Old Doug wasn't such a douchebag!You're going to go Billy Jack?You're afraid of your cat.No he didn't. Woody takes the garlic bread and crams it in his mouth.If you're not a kid.Hey, we're not escaping anything, man. We're on this trip to live.Exactly. Which is why we need to keep riding until we figure out where that happiness is. You don't get old Doug back by just staying put.You did lose him, Doug. You know why? You're housebroken. You're too comfortable. You've got to snap out of it! Doug nods halfheartedly. He knows woody might be right.Right! Slap the bull! What?We're slapping the bull.We are slapping the bull. Doug knows it's no use. He nods, defeated.Wow. So it's literally slapping a bull?All right. I'm going in.Hell yeah. I'm gonna slap the shit out of that bull. Like, pimp-style. The guys look at him, surprised and somewhat impressed. Woody takes a breath and climbs over the fence. He approaches the Bull very quietly and cautiously. He gets within three feet of it, leans in and slaps the Bull hard on the ass. The bull makes an annoyed sound and turns around, but Woody is already hightailing it back to the fence, with an exhilarated look on his face.Whhhheeeeeeew! Woody gets to the fence and hurls himself over. The guys all applaud.Yes! Wow! That felt so good. I just slapped a big fat bull right on his ass! Did you hear how pissed he was!? I just pissed of a bull! Bitch! Woody high fives all the guys.Doug, wait! It's too late. Doug slaps the bull hard, and turns to run.Oh, no you don't! Woody jumps over the fence and runs into the field.Heeeeey! Hey you! Come get me, Bull! The Bull notices Woody and starts to Charge him.Run, Doug! Go! Doug climbs to his feet and sees the bull charging Woody. Woody realizes he's in trouble and starts to run again. The bull quickly catches him and rams him into the air. Woody lands hard, with a grunt. The bull turns back to charge at Woody again, and Bob jumps over the fence.No this is living!Man, did you see the look on Bob's face when he got up? Didn't dodge him that time! Woody and Doug laugh. Bob looks pissed.Okay, fine. But after fishing - we hit the open road and keep moving, okay?Hiiiiiiiidee! DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY look confused. Woody looks around desperately for somewhere to hide - but the Hells Angels are too close. There's no time. Woody spots a port-o- potty from the block party and starts corralling Doug, Bob and Dudley into it.Go! Go! Go! Woody pushes his puzzled friends into the port-o-potty, then gets in with them and shuts the door, just as the Hells Angels cruise by them.Shhhh! They'll hear you! Don't make a sound!I did it for you guys! I wanted you to live!Yes, I'm sorry! I just didn't want us to go back.Because I don't have anything to go back to, okay! Doug and Bob go silent. Woody looks away - trying to collect himself. After a moment, he faces them.I've lost everything. The firm fired me, Claudia left me... It's all gone. My whole life is gone. I don't even have enough money to get my lawn raked anymore. Doug, Bob and Dudley are stupefied. Woody takes a deep breath and continues.That's why I couldn't go back. This isn't a vacation for me, it's the only thing I have left. There's nothing more in my life but you guys. So, I lied about the Hells Angels. I lied because I wanted to have one thing in my life that wasn't a complete failure. A real trip with my best friends... You're all I got. I'm sorry. Woody lowers his head. The guys take this in for a minute. Woody looks at them, waiting for their sympathy. Finally, Doug speaks.Fine! I see how important I am to you guys. That's just fine. I just thought being a \"Wild Hog\" meant something! Woody takes off his \"Wild Hogs\" jacket and throws it at their feet. He hops out of the fountain and storms off down the street.Hey.Yup. Woody gets the canoe to the water and looks back at Doug.All right. Let's go. Doug helps Woody shove the boat out into the water. They both hop in as it floats away from the shore. They sit there staring off in silence.You know what? I screwed up! It happens. Maybe from now on I'm better off just doing things on my own! Woody starts to get up, but then looks at the water around him, and sits.I didn't want to lose, Doug. I've lost everything else and I didn't want to lose this trip with you guys. When we're together, it's like we're all college kids still. I'm not a guy with a broken marriage and failed career. I'm just with my best friends, being happy. And to keep it going, I forgot about what made it so great... That friends never let each other down. Until now. I screwed up the last thing I had left. You guys deserve better. I'm sorry-- Woody eyes water a little and he quickly turns away from Doug. They sit there for another moment.They won't kill us, right? Just a... really bad beating.No way. And how much could a punch really hurt? Not much, probably.Let's go find the Bob and Dudley. Doug looks around the canoe for a paddle.No. I wasn't even going to take this thing out, but I didn't want you to think I was just standing at the lake waiting for you.Bud told me to stand at the lake and wait for you. Doug nods. Bob walks up on the shore, holding a styrofoam cup.Yeah, Bob. We're all good. Woody smiles at Doug.Yeah, Dudley's with Maggie somewhere. MAGGIE COMES OUT OF THE KITCHEN and approaches the table.He has a phone? What happened to freedom?I remember that. His pee turned brown and he started crying.Bob's right. We can call the Highway Patrol after we get Dud back, but we shouldn't piss these guys off while he's still in their hands.No. No way. This is my fault. All this is my fault. I have some money in my severance package. We're using it.What?And the friends. Woody steps over to Doug. Bob looks at them for a moment, then finally smiles and pulls on his jacket.We can still outrun them. They're fat. Woody turns around to see Hells Angles have now closed in behind them, blocking their escape. Jack smiles.shit. I meant full-figured. The Hells Angels close to within a few feet of the \"Wild Hogs,\" and raise their weapons to strike.Just stay clear of the big punches. You've got more stamina than this guy.Um... Just try and get him tired. I don't think punches will do much to him. Doug gives Woody a concerned look. Woody shrugs. Jack steps into the circle and throws off his jacket.Quick! Start kicking him! Don't let him get up! Doug nods and goes to kick Jack, but Jack grabs the foot and pushes him backwards. Doug falls back to the dirt. Jack stands up and dusts himself off.Wait!! Jack turns around as WOODY walks into the circle.Doug's not the leader of this gang. I-- Jack instantly punches Woody in the face. Woody falls down next to Doug. Doug turns his head to Woody. They're both bleeding from their noses and lips.Sure. Jack looks at Bob.You know what? I think I'm going to press on. Keep heading West.Yeah. Why not? I feel good about my life again. And I'd like to see what San Francisco's all about. Doug nods and looks to Bob. You can tell he wants to go.I think so. Dudley? What do you think? The camera PULLS OUT to reveal DUDLEY, sitting on his motorcycle. Next to him, is MAGGIE, sitting in the rusty sidecar now attached to Dudley's bike. She's wearing Dudley's goggles and nods to him encouragingly. Dudley looks back over to Doug, Bob and Woody.", "clean_line": "listen going push agreed price price ll pay like walk away kiss business good bye happens screw woody stevens hard woody talks passes
