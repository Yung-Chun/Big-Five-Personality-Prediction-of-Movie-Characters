{"In-the-Loop": {"SIMON": {"raw_line": "Ah. Yes I do. You'd expect me to say that I suppose.Have we heard anything from Malcolm about last night's interview?Perhaps he didn't hear it.He might be dead. He might have had that massive stroke we've all been waiting for. It's in the post....preventable sickness in many of the poorest countries round the world....and Of course the big one is diarrhoea, which is a major, major issue.... Page 2And so if we can tackle the easy things, like diarrhoea, then we can........and then hopefully that will strike another blow in the war against preventable diseases.Against preventable diseases, yes....Well....personally, I think that war is unforseeable.Yes.On Question Time, you know the funny question they always ask at the end?I think we should prep that now. I'd like to shine on the funny question, cos I'm a funny guy. With a light touch.Ah. Well, I can't say my wife, because I haven't got one, and I can't say my girlfriend, because I haven't got one of those either.No. Boring. And a bloke.Well, that's a good idea. Page 4I don't think so.Paris Hilton?Lily Allen.The Olson twins?What?Shit. He's still alive. When's he due? Malcolm walks in with Toby sheepishly behind him.Come on, Malcolm, he asked me for a personal opinion.I would have blacked up. It was the radio and no-one would have known.But war is -- basically unforeseeable isn't it?Hey Toby. Glad you could join us. Bit of an odd morning, but 'Welcome to the madhouse!'I apologise for Malcolm.We were thinking, weren't we Judy, that I could row back on Question Time tonight.Why? We've been prepping Question Time.But...okay, Judy's lubricated horse cock aside for one moment.... Are you saying that I'm now not allowed to make any media appearances?But I was going to keep to the line: \"I don't actually think war is unforeseeable.\"Is it...I don't know? Foreseeable? No.I'm a cabinet minister. I didn't get here by screwing up every media appearance I ever had.Right. So not inevitable, but not...evitable.Toby, hi. Sorry about earlier -- Malcolm. He's a bit of an...alpha male, isn't he?The Karen Clark meeting? Shit, really? Sure. How did you...?Hey Judy.Tobes here has got me into the big Karen Clark meeting.I think I can work a room, okay? I'm not a room virgin.Michael.No-one will hear me if I say anything. How's your view? Can we swap?Can I swap with you?Well, quickly then, swap.Are people thinking that? That's -- a bit hardcore.No, this is worse. Swap back.Should I say something? She invited me, I should say something. If you don't say something in the first 10 minutes, you can end up not saying anything at all.I'm saying something ... I think I'm going to try saying something.Is she talking about me?She's talking about me!Well, yes, I mean, that's what I said. And I stick to what I said.But that doesn't mean that what I said won't ever change. It's not imutable. Or mutable. It's an ongoing ...Come here - we need to talk What do you mean stop being a `tit'? In what way was I being a tit? Why am I even over here if I'm not meant to say anything?'Meat in the room'? Oh for fuck's sake Judy. I took an hour out to come over here and be room meat?Great, I'm not liver. What was I, tit meat?What's that all about? It looks important.Yeah. Jesus. I really really hope there's not a war. It's going to be a nightmare. It's bad enough having to cope with the fucking Olympics.Fuck. Who let the dogs out? We don't need this.What? No. No. I'll freestyle it.Look, ...loads of things that are actually very likely are also unforeseeable. Y'know, For the plane in the fog the mountain is unforeseeable, but then it, is suddenly very real and inevitable.What I'm saying is that to - walk the road of peace, sometimes you need to be ready to climb the mountain of conflict. Thank you!Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck. Why didn't we nail the line?You did try to warn me but you didn't actually stop me, did you?. That's like shouting 'Train!' as I get hit by a train. You should go 'Look! Train! There's a Fucking Train!'Oh shit. It's Malcolm.How does he do that? Hello?You can't say it's a resigning issue. Because you then have to resign.We can do without the ritual humiliation, Malcolm. You know I'm against talking up the war.I'm just saying. I might be forced to the verge of making a stand.To where...?Oh. Right.Well, look - I don't know what words I used in the heat of the moment, but maybe in a sense I was on the verge. But that's the important thing - I was on the verge. Not in any way decided.I am standing my ground on the verge.I'll give it a whirl.Oh right. I won't talk to him.What's she so fucking happy about? Is she laughing at me?Yes. I do.Can we go somewhere else?So listen. My team for the US. Team Simon. I'm thinking of taking you and leaving Judy?\"So you're the President? And I'm supposed to be impressed by that?\"That's much harder than being President\". Okay. It's settled. Fuck it. She's staying behind. Go and tell her.Don't be callow Toby. We're on official business.There will be a car won't there?Did you book a car?`Simon Forester?'I almost feel like there should be hookers. Do you know what I mean? Really, here, we should have hookers.What? Oh no. God no. No no no no no. I was just - I was just joking. I don't want hookers. I hate hookers. I mean not in an aggressive way. I'm just not interested. But thanks. Thanks very much.Toby, have you....?Tobes. Hi. So! What's the plan? What swanky reception are we going to?Well that's what I'm asking you Toby, my chief aide, my political advisor.Well I am tired but I'm also a career politician Toby, in the political powerhouse of the world for forty-eight hours. So I thought it might be nice to, you know, go out rather than sit in my room trying to spank one out watching a shark documentary, because I'm scared if I watch a porno it'll end up in the Register of Members Interests. So what have you got?Don't bullshit me Toby.No.You can definitely spot the female ones can't you?!Come in....I just wasn't expecting you to be here. Physically here. Obviously, you're always in my heart.Have you come to insult me in a different time zone?Okay. What's that?I was watching that.Right. Can I go to bed now?Am I being tortured? Page 51Uh-huh.It sounds a lot of fun.Do they set fire to the paintings?Yes. He's, you know, among my guys.Er - no problem.Terrific.Toby -- I don't want to read you the riot act here but I am going to have to read some extracts from the riot act. Like Section 1 paragraph 1 clause 1. Don't leave your boss twisting in the wind and then burst in late smelling like a pissed seaside donkey. `The British are coming'?No you're right. I should be thanking you for not throwing up. Well done. You're a star. You didn't wet yourself, you're in the right city, you didn't say anything overtly racist, you didn't pull your dick out and start plucking it and shouting 'willy banjo'. No I'm being unfair, you got so much right. Without actually being there for the beginning of one of the biggest meetings of my career. You're a legend.We'd barely said hello. I've had muggings that have lasted longer than that. We really only spoke about flammable cheese.Mate!Here she comes - shit - look like we're meeting, look like we're having a meeting!Yeah, yeah sure, see you in a mo. Just finishing off some stuff. Okay, we're all done there. Let's roll.Shut up. Follow them. Don't lose them. Lets rock.Hello.See you there. I don't need to ... do any of the things you need to go in there to do, so I'll just see you there.Right, yep. There he is.I'm room meat again. This is a massive abattoir of room meat. Stay outside Tobes, I need a guy on the outside. Make friends with Chad, that boy from The Shining. He knows stuff. Pump him.I'm making you pump Chad. Go on.It'll be easy peasy lemon squeezy.I'm just...watching with interest. IN Britain we have a saying for complicated situations such as this, which is that it's `Difficult, difficult, lemon, difficult.'Thanks very much, but...it's all a bit complex really, in terms of my...Well it just means...I guess, I don't know what it means.It's beautiful.Oh no. Should we send Mark a card?So what are we getting back to? Apart from a nice cup of tea and some knife crime?Great, meeting my constituents. It's like being Simon Cowell, but without the ability to say, `Fuck off, you're mental.'Look at them. They all have that smell....like a charity shop, you know? Afternoon!I'm just back from America, so it was pretty tough to make it up here - but you know. That's me.Good actually.Blown up by spaceships.Yes. No. I understand.No, of course not. Nor should you be treated like one. Okay, Mrs McDairmid. Leave it with me. I'm sure there must be a way through this. Alright?Jesus. Still on about bendy buses? No. Tell him no. What else?Hi Paul, call me Simon. You've met Roz.Lovely.Yes, well, this place can become a magnet for the mentally dispossessed. And for sensible people like yourself, Paul.That...I agree, it's unacceptable.We did arrange to get a quote from a builder, but...Right. Paul, I really need to take this, but I haven't forgotten about you, okay?Toby, can I hand Paul over to you?Well, yeah. I mean, your lot are probably getting it somehow, but our lot shouldn't be.Departmental business. About a wall.Uh-huh. What can I do for you?Well - okay. Yes. Um. Well, I have to say Karen, I have a clear strategy here. I'm playing the long game.We don't call it that, no...That guy's a bit full-beam.Yeah, full-beam. Headlights. I kept thinking, is he going to nut me. He appears not to be nutting me, but he might well nut me.Do you think I came over as weak on the committee over there?I find that difficult to believe.You don't work here. You're not my boss. Fuck off. You can't make me sack people.We need to talk in my office.I think you know.Come, come into my office.Can you come into my office so I can tell you off?It doesn't say that.Wall-ace though?Oh great. The crossest man in Scotland.What is this, surround bollocking?Hi Jamie.A walrus? I'm not fat. I don't even have a moustache.This is all getting...this is a really stressful job, you know that?I don't want to back a war, Judy.Look, drop some hints, put some nods and winks out there, that I'm toying with resignation. Yeah? See if the PM reacts. See how it plays.And nods.No, no, just sort of... That sort of size nod.No, not that much.Oh. Good.What the fuck, Malcolm. This is all going to spin along from here and we have a vote and we go to war. We fight people, and kill them, and our kids get killed, and that's exactly the sort of thing I didn't want to do when I went into politics. That's the opposite of what I want to be doing.Only because the Sun showed a photo of her with wide eyes and her head on a cow.I know the Prime Minister isn't a Viking, Malcolm.Where's the intelligence? Where's the hard evidence?Show me the evidence, Malcolm, that's my fucking bottom line.Should I resign? I've floated that I might, when I thought I wouldn't, so it'll look convincing if I did. I mean, do you think, is it braver to just resign and say, `No, no war'?Or is it actually braver to say, `I don't agree, but I'm going to grit my teeth and get on with it?' Is the really brave thing actually doing what you don't believe?I know what you mean. And the Crimean War -- we got nurses out of that.Exactly. So...right. Exactly.No, I.. where's Malcolm?In the motorcade. Let's get a car without Judy.I want to talk about the resigning thing.But with you and not her. She has this air of moral righteousness that inhibits you from... saying anything morally wrong.What? That wasn't supposed to get outside.It's all a bit `blurrrgh', isn't it?No, what? No.No, but whatever it was I didn't do it.Ah okay. They're not running with that? I have not said that.It's much subtler than that. It's nuanced. I'm playing a much cleverer game than that. I'm a fake hawk. Page 100Fake hawk.Sorry?What? You can't.No. No it's bloody not. I'm - me. You're not me. I decide about all the main things about me, okay? Not you. Me.Like a suicide bomber?I'm thinking of becoming a suicide bomber.Would you like a mint?Do you like me Judy?Yeah, but do you actually like me.I haven't got any thoughts. I'm just staring vacantly into space while a distant voice in the back of my head goes \"oh shit\" like a car alarm in the middle of the night.Just getting my mints. Page 106You've been working for him?Okay, well, right, after the vote, I resign.I'll see you later, Malcolm.Yup. That's that then.What?Piss off, Toby.No, you're right. I am a piss-brain. That's the perfect word, Mr Michaelson. Your mother came up with it? Well congratulate her from me. I am a piss- brain for letting this happen. Page 119No. I'm going to resign, Malcolm. In a hour. You can't stop me now.God, and that's NEWS. Ridiculous, isn't it?What?It's just a fucking wall.No.You haven't even - spoken to the Prime Minister.You fucking haven't I've been right here.I'm not going quietly.", "clean_line": "ah yes expect

No, not you.What can I do for you Paul?Right?I'm sure they're not twigs.Could you tell your mum to stay away from the wall just for the time being?No, sure, but could she use a hose, from a distance?It is just a wall, Malcolm.Hello.How is saying \"hello\" a...Look...we hired some builders. They didn't turn up when they said they would.Hello ladies.Hello ladies. I'm just going to -Great.Yeah I wouldn't want to meet Jamie in a dark alley. Or a bright alley. The whole thing of just being in an alley with him would be scary, regardless of the lighting.Oh yeah. It's just Rob about football.What? No.Could we not talk about accusations and, health issues, in the pub?I don't know, it was a weird, intense time over there. It was...maybe, subconsciously, I don't know, it was a kind of last ditch attempt to stop this, awful...war.In the broad sense. Sorry, can you stop doing that?

I think, if it got leaked, it could stop the war.Does such a thing exist?Though -- maybe? What's brave about doing the `right thing'? Nothing. Doing the wrong thing is braver. In a way.

Oh hi, Paul. How's it going? No, yes, I know the wall is collapsing. I'm as frustrated as you are mate.Look, could I call you back Paul? It's just the Vice President's ... I couldn't? No, okay, let's keep talking...Can we stop running because my hands are really rather badly burned now.Oh? Right. It wasn't?I don't actually recall. It was a busy time.Okay.Where from?\"That's that then\"? That's your quote for the ages is it?'And I remember the moment war was declared. I turned to the Minister and he said \"That's that, then. Anyone want a mint?\".Boss?It's on the BBC News website -- Partial collapse of the wall. Mrs Michaelson's greenhouse has a smashed pane. The BBC had a crew down there.Here.Hi. General?
