{"Belle": {"LORD MANSFIELD": {"raw_line": "What in God's name have you done!!A detail you chose NOT to share.Captain Sir John Lindsay, do you find me a fool? She is a MULATTO!You keep in mind my position..? My reputation...?Then have some sense of propriety boy...and understand what you are asking. LINDSAY lowers his voice, shielding DIDO.How do we raise her...?She takes your name?Captain Sir John Lindsay. Do you recognise him? She nods. A beat as conflict fills him.D'you see here...? This..this is your grandfather, Sir Alexander Lindsay of Evelick.I am here too....do you see?Yes...I am William Murray, First Earl of Mansfield. A beat as he looks to her, affected by this little person. Gently, he leads her to a final portrait.Now...do you see this man? He is my nephew...do you understand...? ...your uncle - Sir David Murray.You are a sharp little one. He is The Seventh Viscount Stormont... ...to inherit everything that we are standing on when I am gone.Indeed. He discovered her mother aboard a captured Spanish slave ship. He was charged with conveying it back to these shores, he tells me.And there I was believing it was sheer lack of `self control'. He has been at sea, six years. All of this child's life!Elizabeth was much in need of a companion.We shall say that in accordance with her birthright, she is entitled to live beneath this roof. Such...is the nature of `order'.She may... ...NOT...in company. We cannot escape society's confines on etiquetteImpossible. Any match her..'other origins' may attract would surely disgrace her and the family rank.I have reason to speak with you alone, Dido. DIDO is quietly alarmed.You have done no such thing.I have not past experience in the ways of breaking grave news to you. He hands her a letter and she reads. A beat, as the news resonates through her, silently. Her pained gaze slowly rises to meet LORD MANSFIELD'S.Yes. I know.You do not! She is only managing the dictates of the householdDinner with guests is a formal proceeding, Dido - we simply cannot impose the disregard of those formalities upon visitors.My dear...I wish it were so simple. Finances may go some way - but Society has a habit of disregarding even one of their own, when opportunity provides.BUT after dinner...when formality is of less consequence...well your presence can raise no defendable objections.Dido, you know the rules of propriety. Far better than Elizabeth, if I am frank. His loving gaze elicits a smile from her, weary. Propriety is everything, after all.The law, Lady Ashford. It is to be interpreted - not merely administered.Your husband of all people knows this.It is a fuss over the bread and butter of a great many in these isles. A great many, Lady Ashford.Dido...my dear.May I present to you the second of my nieces - Miss Dido Lindsay.She must not delude herself. Such decisions are not hers to make.She has no reason. Hers is an inheritance that renders her free of the usual inducements to marry.Mr Davinier, I believe you have already had the pleasure.Decide what? She is hesitant now, awkward in JOHN'S presence.The man is to be paid a fortune. What is there to decide?Dido, you are to simply sit still. Not a challenging task!As you always are - right beside one another. DIDO's chest heaves with distress.Not now, no! You may return the books to the library.Upon her husband's death a widow may receive....Hummm... Yours are grand ambitions.What is the purpose of the law in your eyes, Mr Davinier?Example.It is one of the few trades acceptable to a gentleman.You aspire to the judiciary?Noble if not pompous! A country lawyer, you may make - perhaps! If you pay every regard to what you are taught - but you have neither the rank nor finances for any more!I beg your pardon?You believe you are worthy of such considerations? Such are your capabilities?The Reverend has requested I take his son into my tutorage, Dido. What do you think?I cannot disagree.Justitia fiat, ruat coelum, Mr Davinier - Let justice be done, though the heavens may fall.It does....IT HANGS on `Absolute necessity'. If the cargo was spoiled...If the killing of the..'negros' was truly `necessary' in order to save the ship - as the captain contends.The ship's journey was thwarted by impossible weather conditions - what should have been weeks became months! What once appeared enough water, may not have been!Then do you know what a hundred thirsty slaves are capable of? I can tell you no man happily disposes of his cargo, even in the face of rebellion! So now tell me - were you to dock at port with barely a piece of merchandise left to trade - what would you do? Swallow financial ruin - or claim your due from the insurers. John is conflicted - to speak up, or not?Elizabeth is to come out.You understand the ways of this world for a female, Dido. Elizabeth has no income. When all this is gone to her father, I have nothing to leave her.Dido, you are well taken care of - Of this, you are well aware.You may attend London together to keep Elizabeth company and save the pain of a few weeks separation.You are not to be denied, Dido.These are the keys to the house. They have hung at the waist of your aunt for the last thirty years.Lady Mary is too old to continue in charge of the house. He places the keys in her hand and closes her fingers.You may assume her duties on your return. A most respectable position for an unmarried Mansfield Lady. She stares at him, disbelieving, bereft...Punishing you!! Dido, you are most cherished. Most loved. Why ...why would you say such a thing?Because what?You told her they were wantonly drowned.You have entered my home and utterly taken advantage of the confidential matters afforded you.Her precious care is in my hands and I will decide when she is ready for such realities. Not the son of a vicar! A vicar who, incidently purchased his living from me!Do so! LORD MANSFIELD turns his back on JOHN to glare at the lawns JOHN calmly collects his books, jacket, hat. He hesitates.WHAT, Mr Davinier!Mr Davinier. JOHN stops, turns to LORD MANSFIELD.A word to the wise. Find yourself in her vicinity again, and you will rue the day you cast eyes on me. JOHN hesitates a beat. Then he is gone.I beg your pardon?She is free and under our protection.And paid a very respectable wage.Fraud?That would depend on to whom you may speak.Do you speak on my behalf, Dido?Makes sense. Dido is beginning to sound very much like him.Which one?Spit it out.I will neither be pressured from the inside - or the outside. LORD ASHFORD comes to a stop.How? RULES are in place to dictate how we live - were that not the case, I would not have had the mandate to give shelter to my nephew's child.She is his blood - MINE! And rightfully had entitlement to grow up on the family estate. The parliamentarians may challenge me - let them! I can tell you all, if the law supports the Zong's slave owners as strongly as Murray blood runs through Dido Belle's veins - make no mistake - the insurers will be forced to pay up!Oh?Is that so?I have had reason to speak with Lord Ashford.We are. You once asked me, who would look after her when we are gone. Money is no substitute for a man's protection. I cannot deny her a match so suitable.Where is everybody, Mabel? The carriages are gone.And Dido also?Well is she, or isn't she? MABEL wavers, attempts to sound convincing.This man's ambitions include you. You will endure shame and risk your position for a man without name, who will sully yours and drag your reputation to the gutter!...I have EVERY right...!I know there is a lady in Belsize who is waiting to be your wife.Love? You claim love....??Captain Sir John Lindsay would never behave like this because he was never HERE!...You are destroying your possibilities with the only gentleman who will consider you. Is that what you want?Arrogant...parasite! HE is filling her with worthless ideals. He wants to `make the world a better place'!... LORD MANSFIELD is puffed with fury as he paces the room. He knocks the table again, jolting LADY MANSFIELD.He is laughing at us! His childish campaign simply adds to my already rampant ridicule in the gossip pamphlets and now...! As though he were some kind of...saint, immune from reproach!I never broke the rules.As though she were created of you and I... ...And that is why I simply do not want to see her diminished.Lady Ashford there is little point in repetition...It will hang at Kenwood.Why should that surprise you?What are you reading?You find yourself in such writing?What is it that you want, Dido? What precisely are you searching for? I enabled every rule of heritage so that you could know exactly where you belong. Yet little appears enough for you!You did not become Lord Mayor through being a coward.Why does it matter to you so? JOHN stares at him bewildered, at a loss for words.It is for property!Dido.That is correct!... ...Drive! The carriage begins to move off. JOHN walks alongside it.She is not a slave.This is not about Miss Lindsay. JOHN is confused, flustered.Mr Davinier, the world is a devastating place. You must learn to protect your emotions if you are to prevent matters of both law..and love from devastating you. JOHN is frozen, averts his gaze. LORD MANSFIELD regards him, affected, bangs on the carriage again and is gone.Whether the `jettison clause' of Marine Insurance Law may be brought to bear in this appeal. This is the question. That is, first: whether the slaves were drowned as an anticipatory act. An act to avoid the disease caused by theirjourney, killing them once on shore, and at their destination...depriving the slave owners of any compensation. He takes in the gaze of a free black man in the gallery.Or secondly: whether they were `jettisoned' as cargo! To save captain and crew from certain death, when the extended journey threatened shortage of drinking-water. Let me be clear, loss of water on a ship constitutes a singularly dangerous affair - insurrection of thirsty and hostile slaves at its extreme - and an impossible task to share diminished water reserve, among all those living, at best. Each implies severe threat to the lives of the seamen. In such circumstances our law is transparent and equivocal - the jettisoning of enslaved cargo ...IS legal! And in these circumstances, combined with unavoidable loss of water, our laws leave the ship-owners securely within their rights to make a claim ...and behoves the insurers to pay losses.The ship's owners chose a tight `packing fashion' to transport the slaves...A popular fashion of transportation that is known for causing death and disease.This choice of laying the slaves tightly together is undertaken at the Captain's own risk. In the event that over packing renders an avoidable lack of drinking water on board a protracted journey, such a decision may be viewed as simple `bad management' on aCaptain's part, and further, weigh as his own risk. An extended journey - one in which the destination is overshot may also be viewed as the captain's own mismanagement. The noise lowers to silence. LORD MANSFIELD settles on JOHN.It is not legal...to discharge lives from a ship into the waters, to prevent those lives dying on land, and to facilitate insurance compensation. Whether they be the lives of horses... or human beings ...slaves or otherwise - It is not legal, neither is it right.Further, the claim of shortage of water is illegitimate shown by the evidence put forward. To my mind, it is clear a fraud has been committed in claiming insurance on slaves who were...drowned solely for financial gain. He looks around the room - sees LORD ASHFORD's acceptance. His eyes fall on DIDO now and here they remain.It is my opinion, that the state of slavery is so odious a position that nothing may support it. This case has displayed with searing clarity the depravity of any such nation whose choice is to practice it. You may be certain that I have laboured over my judgement and statements today and am in full understanding of all of the ramifications. Justice be done,though the heavens may fall. JOHN'S eyes brim at the realisation of those words.I find in favour of the insurers and overturn the decision of the lower court. I order a retrial.I am fully aware, Dido.History will judge if your optimism is warranted... ... You are a man of conviction.Then your efforts are not in vain.I have not changed my mind. She is to marry a gentleman. He turns and begins to move to the carriage. JOHN stares at the ground, humiliated. DIDO is incensed.He is...indeed...Dido. And that is why he ought to have a job befitting one.If you would Mr Davinier, I would like you to attend my chambers in the morning. There are matters I would like you to assist me with.And if you think it a good idea...I wish to facilitate your entry to the Inns of Court.Indeed... ...Capabilities such as yours are clearly deserving of such considerations.

No...no surprises Bette!Have I wronged you, Papaa?I thought I should one day have the opportunity to make his better acquaintance.He did not know me.Then it is her cruelty you should lament, Bette, not his stupidity.I...I think love must be a very complicated thing.Or leave... except the dead!Beds...Aunt Mary. We should prepare some extra beds... in case our visitors are to stay... She trails off - LADY MARY raises an eyebrow.I will do your hair, Bette. Oh say we may wear them, Aunt Mary.Yes of course. But I may join after dinner, may I not?She is a most disagreeable... hideous, old maid - I hate her!Papaa...how...how may I be too high in rank to dine with the servants and too low to dine with my family?But...Papaa, am I not..'wealthy', now...an heiress? Surely that changes matters...Of course...As you wish, sir.Wimbridge!There are poachers wandering...! The sound of the echoing doorbell, jolting DIDO. Her eyes dart to the door. WIMBRIDGE hesitates, then answers.Sir, I do not believe we have been introduced! JOHN takes hold of himself, half mortified, half irritated.You shall not interrupt him at dinner, Wimbridge!How do you know?He has much to recommend him. And a second fortune in life should please any wife. ELIZABETH clocks the gaze between DIDO and JAMES.Are you suggesting I now condescend to a gentleman without means, Bette?! What should good society think of us! OLIVER moves to his brother, follows his gaze to DIDO.Well... Papaa...?Yes...Aunt Mary has confirmed it.But...but...Papaa...should he not have wished to SEE me before deciding?I am sorry...I did not know you...If he should...should WANT to paint me!But...Next...next to Elizabeth...?How should any male know the ways of a lady when he has not even mastered the ways of a gentleman?Papaa, may we do this in private!Papaa...!I neither spoke for or against you - since neither is my place.Mr Davinier, my cousin, Elizabeth.Papaa has never taken a pupil, you realise?Mr Davinier, what...what is the importance of the Zong... why is the case before Papaa's court, the supreme court...? He searches her, taken aback. Why is she asking him?I...I am aware of that.Oh. You said those who were drowned.But...why?Thank you. JOHN hesitates, struck with confusion at the maid's words. DIDO becomes awkward. LADY MANSFIELD emerges, disappearing into the dining room.That is not correct.And well you might be - when the son of clergy is permitted to the table before a lady of the house.No. It's a statement of mine!But...what, Aunt Mary?Wait... She is upon him in the CORRIDOR! They stand silent, awkward.Quite a task - to sit for so many * hours... ... Congratulations! I learned of your..your match..yesterday. *I appear the only one to have just learned of this affair?Why do you judge me so? He studies her. She is tentative.It is a fact that I have contemplated on the matter for many hours, and I...I do not think the slaves could have been drowned in the way you say.Mr Davinier...please. Tell me. Tell me what you know!Do not render me your amusement. He traces her vulnerability. It roots him.And what...what is that?But the insurers are appealing.Thank you.Papaa.We are to finally `come out'??But why?And me?Papaa...Papaa, please!No! I am not Lady Mary. I am not an unwanted maid!Are...are you punishing me?Because...Because ...Perhaps.Bette, you could feel no such sentiment for you should either end poor or... broken hearted.Relieved?You are so beautiful, Bette. I hope your match is the most wonderful of all gentlemen.Mabel, I am fine - thank you!What a dreadful shame.Thank you. He places it in the water, stands and examines DIDO. From afar, LADY MANSFIELD watches.I should be delighted, Mr Oliver! Most delighted.Ah now how do I know this is not just another tactic in your battle to conquer? He stops, takes her hand and places it on in his chest.Despite...such pronounced protestations from your brother?What a lovely sound.Really? You are much of the conqueror Mr Oliver. He chuckles, brings his hand up to brush her cheek, gently. She smiles just as her eyes fall on the back of a gentleman's head, shoulders - his movement somehow familiar. The sight roots her, uncertain of what she sees. And then he turns to address another, and his profile becomes clear.Mr Davinier. How...how nice to see you.Forgive me - Mr Ashford, may I present to you...Mr Davinier.He is the son of our Vicar at Hampstead, and was..well, almost father's pupil...Elizabeth and Mamaa are here... in fact.I did not have the chance to see you before you left...Mr Davinier ...to convey my apologies.Your pupilage. Father would never have ended it...you...you never would have had to leave Kenwood were it not...What are you doing here in London Mr Davinier?Not what you wished for.Where are my manners? I trust the future Mrs Davinier is well.I have tried to keep up - with the Zong. These past weeks.What price, a worthless Negro.But that would require a change of law. I know nothing but...No. It is more than that. It's the shame of a law that would uphold a financial transaction upon that atrocity. She is scathing and accepting all at once, affecting him.I have never heard anyone speak like you.No we cannot risk it. He nods - studies her....Good bye, Mr Davinier.Quite.I..I am terribly sorry. I thought I saw the others, I went after them....and found myself lost. OLIVER studies her - she is so nervous...what is she hiding? A moment - then his eyes become forgiving.Is Mabel a slave? LADY MANSFIELD almost chokes on her porridge.Is-Mabel-a-slave! LORD MANSFIELD swallows hard, his jaw tightens.O! Like me!How is the fraud appeal Papaa?The marine insurance. It is a Fraud case, is it not?To cull your `cargo'? To do it solely to claim insurance because it was too diseased to achieve a good price at market? If not fraud, then what?Excuse me. She gets up and is gone.Mr Oliver.Yes. Indeed it is.Good Lord, Mr Oliver! Your ...your wife? Mrs Ashford?!Mamaa, we are engaged! LADY MANSFIELD eyes fill. She touches DIDO'S face softly. *It is a good thing, is it not, Mamaa?No, Bette But..I am sure it * won't be long.Perfect, Bette - pefect. CUT TO:Papaa.Thank you.I..I am terribly light headed this morning, Mamaa. I should like to take rest if it would not displease you.Harry! Harry!Harry, I need your help. I need you to take me somewhere.I shall not be alone, I shall be with you. Please - Harry. If you don't take me, I shall be forced to go alone.No...It would be dangerous.Oh Mr Davinier...I am so proud of you. I am so proud of what you are doing and...achieving.At least thirty per cent of insurers are with you! It is a start. It is a real start.I have something to show you. She collects the two scrolls beside her, each ribbon tied. She hands one to JOHN, smoothing the other on her lap.It is said all of the ship's papers have been `lost'... but...here...I found these in Papaa's library.Papaa's notes on the ship's log. It seems the First Mate has come forward with it - one Mr Stubbs. I could not find the log itself, but look at Papaa's markings - See the map positions - From December 29th, Captain Collingwood and his men directed the ship past no less than eight ports where, you see.... ...there was every opportunity to stop and replenish the ship's water supplies. JOHN studies the log and map together.And they did not! They either ignored the possibilities, or they were never in need.Is it? Perhaps if you made these facts known, Mr DavinierWhat is the alternative? His face searches hers...Papaa would rather I see no ill, as though by ignoring it, it some how escapes me - perhaps by position but not...not by bloodJust as in life, we are no better in paintings...Afraid?Do not feel ashamed. Elizabeth said something when we arrived in London. She said: we are but their property.Gentlemen's. We women are but the property of gentlemen. That is the way it is, in law and in life, is it not? JOHN nods, uneasily. DIDO thinks aloud.And it came into my head that I have been blessed with freedom twice over? As a negro and as a woman?Or have I? Must not a lady marry, even if she is financially secure? For who is she, without a husband of consequence? It seems silly - like a free negro who begs for a master!I remember my Papaa's eyes. They were kind, gentle... a little like yours...I mean...in colour. Grey. He showed me much love, though I knew him only a few hours.She is a ghost in my life - present in my reflection, in each scowl I receive, yet I know very little of her than the colour she has given me.I had never felt it.I am to marry, shortly - Mr Ashford.He is amiable and of good family.The alternative is to replace Lady Mary in her responsibilities at Kenwood.Papaa did not trust I could achieve a match that might raise my rank - or even equal it.Is anyone home, Mabel?What if he is suitable but you do not feel...`yourself' with him?Oh Bette, stop it! It is NOT love!!No. Beat. ELIZABETH swallows hard, disappointed.Oh, Mr James, your manners are as poor as your brother's finances.That is painful, sir.It is not in my repertoire to keep company with beasts.How dare you? HOW DARE YOU!Is she not terribly disappointed that you will not return to Hampstead?Completely. Elizabeth, always asked the questions for me... then took blame for the impropriety when in fact she was protecting me! Dear, dear Bette....I find myself unable to sleep. Papaa is to finally speak in a few days and...well...And yet if he does...stand up...IF he speaks the words and condemns the trade...The Lord Chief Justice of England...it may be impossible for the slave laws of England and its colonies to remain absolute. Is that correct?Then he is not a man of his word.I will help you find the kindest most wonderful of husbands. And I shall ask Papaa to use a portion of my inheritance for your dowry.Bette, anything for you!I think you may be right.Bette...?No!James Ashford is not kind. He is not a man to give your life or dowry to.No!I am trying...trying to make you see. He is not... appropriate!He does not desire you, Bette! At least, even if he does, you would regret such a mistake. He...he laid his hands on me, Bette - in the most un-gentlemanly fashion.He hurt me.Why...why would I lie to you?Bette...I am beneath him??What! Tell me! What am I, Bette? She dares ELIZABETH to cross their line of sisterhood.My mother and father never married - you are correct. But my father acknowledged me as his child. It is yours who refuses to legitimise your position, Bette - that is why you are poor! And that is why it is not me who is beneath Mr James, Bette. It is not me! ELIZABETH stings - she fights tears, before she disappears.Papaa...? LORD MANSFIELD is incandescent. He shakes with rage.NO! STOP! Papaa, you must stop!Go John. You do not deserve this. JOHN'S breath is heavy, his heart pounding. He catches his breath, almost chokes on it as he rises, moving with uncertainty from the carriage, and is gone. DIDO stares at LORD MANSFIELD.Captain Sir John Lindsay would never have behaved like this.I won't.Who, Bette?You said nothing.I should have.I have a tongue, Madam. Though yours explains well enough why I may not marry your son...beat)... You view my circumstances as unfortunate, though I cannot claim even a portion of the misfortune of those to whom I most closely resemble. ON LADY MANSFIELD stung by the thought.My greatest misfortune would be to marry into a family who will carry me as their shame - as I have been required to carry my own mother.Her apparent crime, to be born negro, and mine - to be the evidence. Since I wish to deny her no more than I wish to deny myself, you will pardon me for wanting a husband who feels `forgiveness' of my bloodline is both unnecessary and without grace.Why did I, slave, beyond my lot aspire.. The line repeats itself in her head.Will it?Why should it not? LORD MANSFIELD says nothing, observes her, curious.Poetry. A gentleman named Thomas Day. He speaks of a slave who agreed to marry a free woman. A voice to people...people like my mother - who do not have one.I don't know that I find myself anywhere. I have no place that I may claim.Papaa, you enabled every rule, but you had to overlook just as many to raise me within good society. And what if there were not a rule Papaa? What if that rule that allowed you to take me did not exist? Would you have returned me to the slums? The air is poignant with the question.You are courageous. When it comes to the matters you believe in, society is inconsequential. You break EVERY rule when it matters enough. Papaa, I am the evidence. This painting...is the evidence.Fine! Then step down and allow me to take the reigns.No!You may not blame Mr Davinier ...My attendance today is absolutely at my own volition ...for matters which concern me.And Mr Davinier is not a gentleman? Her voice rings out, furious. LORD MANSFIELD stops...My affections are with him, Papaa. I wish for nothing... nothing, if not to be his wife.Of course. He sees what I see. His words were as clear as...It is not. It is not all that is before you Mr Davinier... I love you...for all that you are, and with all..all that I am.", "clean_line": "elizabeth papa bette surprises bette wronged papaa thought day opportunity better acquaintance know cruelty lament
