{"Two-For-The-Money": {"BRANDON": {"raw_line": "Last play. Slant red, right back on two. On two, Scottie. It's a lock. A guaranteed TD. I've already seen it. So relax. There's nothing to worry about 'cept one thing -- after we win and they're shoving cameras in your faces, I don't want to hear any \"Hi moms.\" Guys, it's overdone, the fans are tired of it and if you have to thank some one you can just thank me. See you in the end zone.What's the rehab time?When do I play again?The patient's got a question!Could you get him out, please?Just get out!Let's ease back into it with our breadHe represented the nearest guy I could grab.--You've reached the Jessica Simpson hot line! Jessica's going to tell you all about Nick's surprise birthday party and her rockin' new panty line at Wal-Mart, but first, here's a little fan trivia to win a VIP Gold Package back stage pass to Jessica's Omnicon Hotels Summer Tour--I'm in the middle of taping.... Yeah, a little.--Kansas City is 7-1 against the point spread versus division opponents coming off a Monday night game. Take K.C. minus the six points. Call tomorrow for my pro football game of the year -- Tampa Bay versus Oakland. That's 900-656-3100. This is Brandon Lang saying good night and good luck everybody.I went 9-2 in pro football Sunday and hit my third straight Monday night parlay.I want a raise to 12 bucks an hour.You're not picking 75 percent.Hey Stu, where's the action this weekend?Crazy.That game's gonna be won by coaching, Stu. Gruden put that Tampa Bay team together before he came to Oakland, right? He knows every weakness of that team and every strength. He knows Brown only likes to catch over his left shoulder and he'll have him double-teamed to the right. He knows Gannon always throws on a 3-step drop and the linebackers will take away the middle of the field. Gannon'll be intercepted at least 4 times on Sunday.... Awesome dude. That's a righteous ride, Denny.Wanna bet?At least they kicked me a cap.Hello.Yeah?How'd you get this number? If you want picks, call my 900 line.Who is this?Do me a favor and lose my number, I gotta go to work.Hello.This is a joke, right?I'm gonna pay. I'll pay you--I thought it was a service.I've been in better.No.I played quarterback in college. Division one.I used to sing at church.I don't know. I guess.When I was a kid I thought I wanted to be a pastor... obviously not now. I mean, yeah, I believe in God.That was six years ago.Just the 900 number recordings, it was full time, I mean we got 10 bucks a call.How'd you afford that yacht if the picks are free?You didn't answer about the free picks.What's on the second floor?No, that clears up pretty much everything.Me? No. Why?Really? What's she like?Hi.Nice to meet you.He makes all his employees do this?How often?Weird.I've never had my nails done before.No thanks. I'm fine.Excuse me?I've been pretty focused on staying in shape. I mean a beer once in a while.No.What about it?No.Toni, huh? Are you here full-time?Well I'll tell you, Toni. I bet on something once. Risked everything I had and lost.I swore I'd never do it again.What?What? Walter just said I was meeting a woman. He acted like...You're kidding me? Coming here... the manicure... this was an interview?How'd I do?Hold on. What's wrong with Brandon Lang?Hello sports fans! This is John Anthony in the Big Apple with my big money picks! The action starts Saturday with college ball and our first matchup, Michigan against Indiana--What's my sales pitch? 77 percent's my sales pitch.John Anthony here, ready to make all your betting dreams come true! Call now and let me win for you! The point spread in the Indiana/Michigan game's up to four, making that game a gimme--I wasn't afraid of anything. I was working my ass off, trying to get back in the game.This is John Anthony here, and from Wall Street to Tokyo to Hollywood, all your big money stays and plays with me! Winning consistently's the name of this game and I always remain the same, winners on a consistent basis, 77 percent winners! So sit back and relax becauseC'mon! First too little, then too much --Tell me what you want.Walter? Are you okay?Should I call someone?What are you doing?I'll have the bruketta and the -- this, with the pasta.Bruchetta.Actually, truth be told, I've never had a 12 dollar bottle of water either.No. I just, this place is great.I will tomorrow. My mom works nights at the casino, she'll sleep till three.Oh, they're great. We talk all the time.Mom's terrific. Amazing lady. I got a little brother, Denny, going to college next year. Complete motor head. Dad's a... well he's a sports nut. He was, I mean, it all came from that.Very.She's cute.So are the two guys she's with.I don't bet, Walter.You're beautiful.I just want to get to know you.I want to get into your mind, your heart, your soul. I don't see you wearing any pants in this equation.I'm Brandon. What's your name?Alexandria. Beautiful name for a beautiful girl.You're telling me that all this is legal?No, he's in the middle of renegotiating. It's a tantrum, he'll play Sunday.What's not to like?Pleasure meeting you. By the way, Jerry, New York's gonna win straight up. They always play the fish tight. Tonight it's foregone, they win outright.You mean me?John Anthony doesn't exist.Look, making predictions is one thing -- but pushing people to bet, it's not me.You got a whole room full of salesmen.I don't want your money --I don't want your money, I want your bookie's money!Nothing, I just don't talk like that.It's not that I can't. Why do I have to?I'm happy for you and your friend, Walter, but I'm not using it.It's not me. Let it go.Where are we going?... No, I mean, we walked in together --What the fuck was that?!You heard me! I said what was that?So?Hey, I stopped by to say hi, I'm Brandon.I'm picking now with you and Jerry.Today's your day, Amir! It's a Pamplona thing, I'm running wild in the streets this weekend! Starting with the hottest Saturday of my life! How much can you lay with your bookie? 20 large?--Amir, this is my lock of a lifetime! Texas plus the six points! They win by two touchdowns!--Amir, buddy, I'm talking about banging out the biggest win of your life.Hold on, I got Vegas on the line.Tomorrow we gotta get you a new drink. But for now, this is what you're gonna do. First, you're going to bet 20 large on Texas, then you're going to put on aGood question. What about it?We take a percentage if WE win, Amir -- not exactly your problem of late, is it?It's simple, you don't get any more picks. Comprende? So make the bet, make the drink and let's roll this intoTo hell with power ratings -- McNab lost his dog yesterday! Hunting accident. Everyone knows you don't mess with a man who just lost his dog! Take Atlanta plus the points and send me ten thou Western Union by tomorrow, Stan -- let's ride this wave into Sunday!What's all the commotion?Aversion to consistency?Well that's consistent.That's me. You mean me.It sounds like a promotion.--I'm in.It's the only move. For six years I've been living on Ramen noodles. For the... Should I wait a little to create some tension? Of course I understand, I'm John Fucking Anthony. I've got the crystal ball...No.I'm scared shitless.This is different.There's no opponent.Not in my case. You tell us, Jerry.That's right, but with me it makes you M-O-N-EE! I'm picking 80 percent, is thatA knock would be nice, Jerry.No.I'll rush right over. Stat.Inside? I've got nothing inside.This wouldn't have anything to do withWho?Carl, John Anthony here, how's the fast-food king...? Good--Let's get really wild and you can blow mine.Toni put one of those lamps down in my room. The ladies do love it.Denny, it's me... What'd I tell ya?... Hey, it's your money, dude, you won it... Well did you hook it up yet?... Hell yeah, crank it, let me hear--Sure sounds like it! I'm heading out with some people, everything else cool?Dad? No, why?Really?Let me ask you something, Walter.Have you been blocking any of my calls?Does that include my father?That's not the point!You tell it, you seem to know.That's a really scary thought.Are you serious, Amir? You gonna fucking haggle with me over a measly 50 thousand on the 250 grand I won you this weekend?--The first time you call me you're in a hole the size of the Grand Canyon, you're crying about hocking your fiance's ring and this weekend you're phoning me from a suite at the Bellagio that I put you in -- you know what -- I'm cutting you off... You want to continue with me, I'm tagging on a 10 percent aggravation tax! Now get to Western Union and shoot me 75 grand by tonight and we'll kiss and make up.... Mom?Never better. Kicking ass and taking names. Did you get the money I sent?Good good good. I talked to Denny. Next month I'm flying you and him out here. First class. I'll put you up at The Plaza. You'll love this joint.I made it. Earned it. Every fucking cent. Put it in Denny's college fund.It's just how people talk here.He's me. I'm him.He's pretty fucking salty -- geez, I'm sorry, Mom -- I mean yeah. Look, the main point is I'm learning a lot here.I appreciate the concern, Ma, but the checks I've been sending -- the checks you've been cashing -- those are from John Anthony.Gotta put you on hold, Ma.What do you know about him?No, but I want a bonus if we pull it off.Relax, I'll get in character in the car.... Walter?Your vial -- where's your pills, Walter?Hold on, Walter we're getting help! Oh my God. Listen to me. Walter -- Walter. You're gonna be fine. Hold on!Save your strength. Help's coming. Help's coming.Of course I do.I do. I really do love you.A lot! Now don't talk.Save your strength, Walter.What?You sick fucking fuck! That was too goddamn fucking far!!!It's a privilege to meet you, Mr. Novian. You have a beautiful home. Let's start with how much you bet.Nice round number, is that our ceiling here? Is that the most we're working with?Do you rent that yacht out there?Well, sir, that's how I feel about this weekend. That may sound cocky, I don't care. I didn't come down here to lie.If I did I wouldn't share that with you. My record speaks for itself. The truth is I know these teams better than they know themselves. I'm going 12 for 12 this weekend, and that includes the Monday Night parlay.With all due respect, Mr. Novian, you can't afford not to.Can you? What I'm saying is can you -- can anyone for that matter -- afford to lose as much as a man like you probably needs to bet to feel a win? Winning's a funny thing, Mr. Novian... it's one of those rare commodities on earth money can't buy. Or was, until you called me.The price is a quarter million, Mr. Novian -- up-front -- in addition to a percentage of every game you win.And we've never charged it before. But with what you're betting, 250 up front's a bargain. You want this weekend's winners, that's my offer. Take it or leave it.Nope.Three questions. What's your mother's name?What street did you grow up on?Who do you like Monday night?Pick one.I'll do your job tomorrow, today you do mine.Pick one. Stop stalling. You know who's playing. Seattle versus New Orleans.Sure I can! Over 34 points or under!Like a lot more than that. Relax. I think we know I can pick. Today I'm picking you. The outcome'll be the same.Didn't they tell you? There is no if.How much of that big stack's mine?...A 100 fucking thou? On two million?I was thinking of ten percent.I got you Novian.You can afford to, you're holding it all. C'mon, I only want what's fair, Walter.I'm winning... I'm winning...It's just like sex. You start by massaging the numbers, very relaxed,I have a 10:30 tee time at Wingfoot with a client, that Howell guy. Don't call me unless the lines change.Fun? Senor, you have obviously never played Wingfoot.I'm not asking you if I can leave, Walter -- I'm telling you that's how it is, understood? You want my picks, hell I'll make 'em now.I don't need it.Nice neighborhood.I'm in the zone, Walter. Locked in. You want my picks, I might as well do it now!Where're you headed?Come on, get in. I'll give you a lift.Some ride, huh? Feel that? Feel that?Why? This car was made to go fast.C'mon, Toni, loosen up.That's not what I asked.What do you do for you, Toni, for yourself.That's not living, Toni. That's just maintaining. You cashed in.Well, nobody's perfect... except me last weekend going 14 andHell yeah. You oughta try it some time.I'm gonna go work out.There's still Monday night and the parlay.I don't know.Monday night's fine.I don't bet.I like the pick, Walter.With my mother in it.Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck!!!Denny! Hey -- yeah, I'm in a bar.... Of course in New York, I own this town. What's going on -- you okay?... Tonight's game? You took my picks? How much?...What are you doing here?I had to get out. Clear my head.Nope. That's how I wanted it. Just make the picks and get the results later.I think we kicked ass.I told you. Last week was nothing.... What'd I go?Just give me the numbers, Walter.Fuck!Enough. I get the idea, Walter.Son of a bitch... What the fuck--This is my time off. It's how I clear my head. You want to talk, pick a time.I'm leaving.What the fuck is this about? If you don't like my picks, use someone else.You flew to New York for--... I'm sorry.I don't know what you want me to say. I'm sorry. I am. I'm very sorry.I am very, very sorry. That's a lot of money.I'm sorry!Look, I'm not it -- I...No. It's not a good time. What do you need?I gotta pick a winner is what I gotta do. I gotta get back on track.I gotta figure this out.I'll figure it out...Man, you got a Doberman for a doorman.I came by to take you out for a late dinner and a couple of killer bottles of wine. C'mon. We'll go back to that place where we met.What the hell's gotten into you? What about that night?Hello.Amir?No, now listen to me -- we got a big weekend coming up, buddyWhat?I know what the problem is!I'll come back later.Who were they?Who were they?What's with the money, Walter?What happened to the two mill, all the other money?You're betting my picks?... I'm Brandon Lang, Walter. Brandon's the one who played sports. Brandon's the one who can pick games. I lost touch with him -- myself. It wasn't an act, man. I became John Anthony. But he's not me. If I go back to being Brandon--No thanks. I'll stay here. Eat light.No, I'm fine.Thanks anyway. Maybe later...Pressure doesn't help.That's who I like.You're looking at him....I'm finished. I'm done.I can't do this anymore, Walter. I can't sleep at night. I can't eat.It's a lot more than that.Walter, it's over. What use could John Anthony be to you now? Only an idiot would follow him after the streak I've been on.Who said anything about next year?I'm not doing this next year.Bullshit!Don't talk to her like that.What time is it?Hey, I didn't know you were coming.She is.Nobody could.I gotta win one more game.It's still early. Come in for a while.Hey darlin'.Congratulations, I didn't know.I can't take this.It's too much.Turn it off.Heads, New York. Tails Denver.Heads, over. Tails, under.Wanna know about the picks?I flipped a coin to decide.... Wow. What an offer. The phones'll be flooded.You can't guarantee they'll win! It's insane!What if you lose?At least cap it out!I don't know what you're talking about.Maybe he thinks he already did lose everything.It's not over yet, Walter. I wouldn't change my bet.It's me.Hey, hey the big winner. What's going on?C'mon, I know it's rough, it's supposed to be. A friend turned me on to the place. She said it's the best.I don't know, but I got an airport full of planes to choose from.Yeah, I told her.We're up against a tough team today, toughest on our schedule. But you're ready for it. You're prepared. Most important I want you to go out there and have some fun. Enjoy yourselves. Keep it loose. Because you can't make me any more proud of you than I already am.

Look, on Sunday, my daughter, an angel, turns six, it's not likely to happen again. SheWhoa, look at you. The Marlboro man.If you can sell you'll never starve. Ever speak in public? Perform? Anything like that?I know, I'm talking about not in uniform.Oh really? So you're religious?Certain things, you either are or you aren't. Which is it?Relax. What do I care? Besides, it's against the law to hire based on religious orientation. You're not a republican are you? Just kidding.C'mon, you won three conference titles at a major university. You think I went to college? I'm autodidactic. Big word, huh? Know what it means? Self-taught. Partially by reading, sure, but mostly by keeping my eyes open and asking a lot of stupid fucking questions. I swear to God I'm looking at myself 30 years ago. A taller, more athletic version maybe, but the resemblance is remarkable.I'm not supposed to smoke any more, among other things. It's bad for my condition. So before I die, did you do anything other than the sports phone in Vegas?Chump change, Brandon. We're angling for bigger fish here. You see, the networks don't talk about it and Uncle Sam can't tax it, but sports gambling is a 200-billion-dollar-a-year-business. These gamblers have needs, Brandon. Come Monday morning, after a losing weekend, a lot of them have big needs.That's every pro game played last Sunday.There is no yacht. Good, keep asking question. Next.I know. What else?That's where we print the money. Any more?Great. Welcome aboard. We got some good stuff to work with.Ever have a manicure?Because you need one. Besides, there's a girl you gotta meet.Beautiful, you'll like her--I'm starting you on the 900 numbers, same gig you did in Vegas. You'll make your picks and record them every day, once a day Monday through Friday and five times a day on weekends. Each call's worth 25 bucks a shot. Right now we get a few dozen hits a week. We should be doing triple that. I'm sending down some test copy. Before you record it, a little advice.Your pitch sucks, it doesn't exist. The pieces are there, we just gotta bust you out.From now on you have a new name -- John Anthony, \"The Million Dollar Man.\"Brandon Lang is still at home with his mother. You're selling a lifestyle here, and John's livin' large. John's got a direct line to God and for a measly 25 bucks a call you're gonna let the world's losers listen in.What's your sales pitch?Stats aren't enough! These are gamblersCertainty in an uncertain world!What is that shit? You spent 6 years bouncing from one dead-end job to another. Riding to work on a frigging bicycle. Were you making some kind of statement? What the hell were you afraid of?You are back in the game! Convince me you belong here!It's a start.No. What do you want, Brandon? That's what this is about!... Huh?... It's nothing.Not unless they got a spare heart. I'm okay.Courage wants to laugh.He's a machine, all he does is work out and pick winners. Talk about fit. Go take a peek, see him with his shirt off. I did. He's a serious side of beef.Check him out, you know you want to.It's bruchetta. Like little pizzas without the cheese.Don't worry about it. Anyone goes 20 for 24 in college football, 12 for 14 pro can call it whatever he wants. Ever drink a thousand dollar bottle of wine? Steward!It's a celebration. Just because he's out with a couple of reformed drunks doesn't mean he can't enjoy himself.He thinks we're fighting.175 calls on the 900 number.He's very close. They sound terrific.Kid grew up with the frigging Cleavers...I should've ordered two.Oh yeah, I've been meaning to tell you. I had a check-up yesterday. AfterwardsYou didn't touch the sauce.I read chocolate's good for you.Don't get dramatic, Toni. In biblical times you'd just move in with my brother Morty.--Wow. What a meal. Do you feel good, Brandon? Content?Yeah, I can tell. Don't be. Ever. One week's over, another begins. The past is merely a prologue. In this job you have to push the envelope every day.Look at that. Beauty and the beasts. What do you think of her, Brandon?Cute doesn't half cover it. The girl's gorgeous. And bored out of her mind. Waiting for some young buck to save her from those two gorillas. Check it out. She's eyeing you again, Brandon.I'll bet you 10-to-1 on a 1000 you can't pick her up, cash, if you leave with her.Who's gambling? It's a challenge. If Brandon leaves with her I give him ten thousand dollars, that's probably more than he made last year. If not, he gives me a grand, which I'll give to you.All right. Before you bust a move, just one thing...I'll send over a bottle of champagne.The voice of reason. She's right. I owe 'em a meal. Hey -- here we go, Brandon, your girlfriend's going to the bathroom.Well get moving, slick.Hey, I just raised the bar. C'mon, kid. John Anthony could close her.Everything you've ever done's been leading up to this moment. Put your ear to the door. Hear that? It's the sound of possibilities. The din of greatness.We use the 800 number and free tips to bait the hook. Then the bettors areThis is the day's phone sheet, it's a list of everyone who's called. Only way to keep track of the action. All leads equal money.Fuck him if he can't take a joke.It better be. Five of these guys are off-duty cops. We're just advising people how to bet, not making the bets for 'em.Brandon Lang, meet Reggie.I had three guys who picked games. I fired one last weekend. I'm giving you his job. This is your office. From here out your picks are going straight to our biggest customers. How do you like it?What do you think?Jerry's our top handicapper, came to me straight out of grad school. Jerry, meet the new kid in town.Not you. John Anthony.That's a shock 'cause I'm standing in his office and you're sitting in his chair!Pushing people? Get real, this country was built on gambling. Look at Wall Street -- one big casino. The state spends millions hawking the lottery. If people want to pay for advice on who to bet, who are we to say no? Stop being selfish, spread the word! Check your bible, Brandon, tis better to give than receive.Big bettors don't want to talk to a middle man, they want to speak to the guy making the picks -- and you're picking 80 percent winners.--Jesus, don't start that shit again. Sell me.What happened to the fuck?I can't have someone working for me who can't say fuck.Because there's no other fucking word that can convey the precise feeling and fucking flavor of life's various predicaments and certain concepts the way a well-placed fuck can. Fuck is your friend. Fuck can be your best friend.Chaucer used it 600 years ago. It was good enough for him. C'mon--C'mon, repeat after me -- fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. Fuck he, fuck she, fuck me, fuck them, fuck me -- try it.Backbone. Almost as good. We'll keep working on the other thing... So, you really like New York in tonight's game?Continue your education.We're here for the gambler's anonymous meeting...My name's Walter. I'm new to the group.Not even close. You're a lemon. Like a bad car, there's something inherently defective in you. And you. And me! All of us here -- we're lemons! Big, juicy, acidic, ice-tea flavoring lemons! We look like everyone else but we're defective because when most people make a bet they want to win, while we, the degenerate gamblers of the world, we're subconsciously playing to lose. All humans like going to the edge of the abyss, but what makes us different is we go all the way and hurl ourselves off into the void! And we like doing it so much we do it time after time after time! Me? I always felt most alive when they were raking away the chips, and every one here knows what I'm talking about. People like us, even when we win, it's just a matter of time before we give it all back. But when we lose, and I mean the kind of loss that makes your asshole pucker to the size of a decimal point, there's a moment when you're standing there and you've just recreated the worst possible nightmare this side of malignant cancer for the 20th goddamn time and you suddenly realize -- hey, I'm still here, I'm still breathing, I'm still alive! In order to really live you have to be aware of your own mortality -- and a losing bet of a certain size is one of the best ways... Yeah. So?Check the charter, buddy, we all left our jobs at the door. You gonna toss an ex-alcoholic bartender out of an AA meeting?... What'd you just say?No, you said \"What the fuck?\" That's what you said.That was great! It was all worth it! Don't you see? I felt your anger because of that one word! Well done! I'm proud of you! The progress you're making Brandon, I gotta say, it's exhilerating!There's only one thing you have to know about any of our clients -- they're all in the hole. The second they pick up the phone, wham! Right to the point! You're above them! Let 'em feel it! More confidence! More John Anthony!10-2 in pro football? 85 percent for the weekend? Jesus, you're a mutant.Life is fucking... good.I've been tracking you since last year.--Can I get the damn thing out? I want to put John Anthony on tv this week.That's right. You, John Anthony. You're one in the same.Hold on. Before I say another word, understand -- you do this thing, Brandon, and from here out you gotta eat, sleep, shit, breathe, walk, talk and fart JohnBet your ass it is. Five-star.Living, not acting. You understand that as of right now Brandon Lang with his fettucini knee and his self-fucking pity is as flat dead as Donald Trump's hair and John \"I-can-walk-on-fucking-water\" Anthony has taken his place?She's right. There's no going back. I mean that. This is gonna cost me. I'm talking about building an empire around you. Do you understand that?I need a new car for my friend.With my wife naked.I think he likes that one.You okay?Don't worry about your lines, it's all scripted. You've been here before, kid, just think of it like a football game.How?Perfect, then you're a lock to win.Welcome to this week's edition of The Sports Advisors! America's premier sports information program with myself, Walter Abrams, Jerry Sykes, Chuck Adler and a truly gifted newcomer to the Sports Advisor panel, a substantial find -- John Anthony! We're entering week six in pro football! This is when the cream rises to the top! This is when things get hot! It's oven mitt time! This is big-time ball season so let's get right into it with the Wizard of Odds -- Jerry \"The Source\" Sykes! Jerry, what's the Sykes System predicting for this weekend?Our experts know how to read between the lines, we know how to analyze a point spread, we're not pulling rabbits out of... It bites you on the ass?I'm not here. Go back to sleep.Going for a run. See the sunrise. We're doubling volume this week. And doubling it again after that. He can pick, he can sell, he's gonna change things around here. He's the real deal. Knows sports from the inside. That's how he picks. Guy like him comes along once in a -- a --Yeah, a lifetime.Not tired.I'm just gonna run the bridge, up Fifth, circle Central Park, be back in no time.Just a quick once-around.Just for a sec. I've gotta meet the trainer tomorrow. Told me to run. Run in place, or from one place to another...What a weekened! Helluva Christmas bonus if this keeps up. Where'd you hide the phone sheet?Did Brandon take the call?Don't mention it to him. And don't patch the guy through. Say Brandon doesn't work here, you can't reach him.For some people.There's a 50-dime bettor on line three. Wants to talk to John Anthony.His name's Carl. Carl owns a couple dozen McDonalds franchises. Guy's a gazillionaire. That sign out front might as well be his bank account.Was.Your clients are jumping ship you lactose intolerant fuck! Get outta my sight!Easy 200, huh? Here's something extra for a cab.No, no, you think she was for me? Are you crazy? No. I just had her come up to pay her. I got her for John.You think I slept with her? C'mon!Brandon, we all call him John now.New city, no friends, working all hours.I don't understand this. I was helping him out, that's all.This kid's different, he's different -- wait a minute. This has nothing to do with you, you know I do business up here. Why are you so angry?You're jealous. Look at you!Gee, I don't know -- Brandon screwing someone?That's not where those thoughts enter.You'll be happy to know he didn't sleep with her. I paid her off just for coming. No pun intended.... Julia my jewel, you're getting big angel.Course we can. Who am I gonna be?Look at you. I like the tan.John's up first tonight, Jerry.John Anthony's leading off tonight.Somebody tell the engineer there's an echo in here.No, that's called a mutual fund, Jerry.He's leading.That's baby talk! You need a fucking rattle! Sit down!See that? He made the safe play. Me, I would've walked, but I'm a fucked-up human being. That's the difference between us. Right there. Jerry's a statistician, I'm a gambler. And you're not a gambler, not really -- until you bet more than you can afford to lose.Welcome to week 7 of pro football!I'm starved, there's a new steak house around the corner. You two split a prime rib, I'll get the porterhouse, we'll whack it up!Stop worrying. We're set--Shoot.Of course. You don't need distractions, there's a lot of crazies out there.You're asking, I'll tell you... Yeah.Hold on, Brandon, if I didn't block his calls would you've talked to him? Honestly.Then what exactly is the point, Brandon? What's the full story here? What's the deal with your old man?--I only know pieces. I was trying to spare you from something.... That's it? That's the best you can do? Hell, Toni and I'll match our dysfunctional childhoods against yours\"Great?\" Tell him about the uncle--Don't sugarcoat this shit, you were abused by everybody but the family pet, isn't that right, honey?If not me, then pick someone else. It's all in your head! The shit that happened to you, to Toni, to me -- you know what it is? Just that, shit that happened.Dad! Is that you?How's Mom?!I love you too! Don't wait up!We're going to Puerto Rico!Since Ricky Martin moved out, all that's left are tourists, cruise ships and C.M. Novian -- one of the biggest sports bettors in the world. He just called. Wants to meet you in person! To-day! Flight leaves Laguardia in 45 minutes.Not much, 'cept for the fact he's a world class prick. Bastard treated me worse than my Hong Kong tailor. Never once returned a call. I've been trying to bag this guy for years. Do you have any idea what this is worth?Look at me. There is no if -- it's only when. This time he called us, remember? You hooked him. Know that. Sweat that.Brandon --... Do you love me?Uh-huh.... How much?I believe you. I believe you love me. I love you too... Just one thing --... Would you love me if this was a joke?I'm fine. Just practicing...I'm okay! Little gas. Must've had too many peanuts on the plane.You weren't listening! You're not paying attention to me! There's no such thing as too far! Push everything as far as you can! Push it until it starts pushing back and then push some goddamn more! Remember that when you're with this guy today!I start to die, fuck the hospital, just sit me down, I wanna kack here.Mr. Novian! What can I say? An honor. This is my associate, John Anthony.They score, we win!100 fucking percent!Here, get you teeth fixed. There might be some other businesses you can make two mill in one weekend, but tell me, someone please tell me -- where else are you gonna have this much fun?A one with five zeros behind it.You're working out of my shop.Really? Is that what you were thinking?Nice job, now don't blow it by getting ahead of yourself. I'm looking beyond the money.\"Fair?\" Honey, you don't know what fair is. What's fair is not giving you the money. Now I'm only gonna say this once. If you want something from me more than a gazunheidt after a sneeze you have to do more than think about it. Or ask for it. You gotta earn it. You gotta fight for it. You gotta rip it out of my fucking talons. John Anthony would know that. That's what he'd do. As a matter of fact, next time you come with that shit, come as John Anthony. 'Cause from now on I'm not talking to you about money.Dance with me. Close, that's it. I gotta dance with you more. Listen, I'm thinking of buying a plane. Big one. G-something. We can just get on it and go, you and me, anywhere in the world, any time we want. There's a house for sale in the Bahamas with a runway right beside it. Comes with its own 50-foot boat. Two for one. What an investment. Anything happens, you and Jules always have it. Let's go down and check it out. Next week, just us, barefoot in the sand.What? Oh, c'mon -- hell no.I am not gambling. Not now, not ever. 18 years clean. That shit's over.Get a lie detector if you don't believe me. Shoot me with truth serum. Baby -- we just made two-million dollars. I'm working miracles here. Now can I enjoy a dance with my wife? Huh? I swear, it's a shame you can't drink, we need something to kill that bug up your ass.Know what time it is?--Wrong. It's time to press, my friend. We're yanking out all the stops. When you're winning -- you press.What are you doing?The salmon are running! You're staying right here and fielding calls. You're not going off to play golf and have fun.Stop screwing around, you got a lot to do before this weekend.Whoa -- hold on -- slow down -- today's only Tuesday, you have all week.Hey -- we're gonna be advising somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 million dollars this week.You're really gonna make your picks now? No study? No analysis? Just like that?... Okay, fine. Take a break. Go play golf. We'll put the picks on ice and look 'em over tomorrow.Then the next day!Sit down! You're watching every game! Every second of every minute of every game! Don't even think of leaving!... How do you go 3 and 11? Wanna know how -- you make Sunday's picks on Tuesday! It rained in Cincinatti! Two starting QBs didn't play! You're a handicapper, not a psychic!Fuck Monday night! Fuck the parlay!You fucked with me, right? Joke's on me, right? The money thing. Okay, I think we're on dangerous ground here but I'm giving you a bump, 10 percent. Now what about Monday night's game? You want to look over that pick? Because everyone's gonna double down to climb out of the fucking hole you put 'em in.You'd bet your mother's house on it?If you did?On your mother's house or not?Helluva swing. Great game. Sport of kings, right? Or is that horse racing?Southie told me where you were.You haven't seen the scores?Highest sales volume ever. Take a guess.It was amazing.You're right, nothing compared to how much we lost today!I have an idea. I give you a few glimpses of what happened here today and you take a stab.You don't like that game. Too bad. Woulda been fun. Grown men crying on the phone. Wives screaming in the background. Three salespeople quit 'cause they couldn't take the pressure!No. When you lose 10 out of 12, fuck doesn't quite cover it. What would be more appropriate is something like \"Holy Fucking Shit!\" Or \"My Fucking God.\" Or \"Jesus Fucking Christ!\"You're right. I mean 2 for 12 on our biggest volume weekend -- what the hell's left to say? Except maybe keep the phone number and switch it over to a fucking suicide hotline!Tomorrow morning, Brandon! Bright and early! We start in all over again! No getting off! I'm gonna ride you until you're more sick of me than losing! Turn it around and we avoid a lot of pain!I'm busy.You got a good hole, Jerry. Stay in it.You got one good weekend under your belt, don't push it.Take a hike.You heard me. You're fired. Goodbye.Beat it, you cut-rate parasite!Get out! You don't work for me anymore!I am! You couldn't pick your fucking nose without a computer! You're small! You belong in a can! Show some self-respect! It's over, Jerry -- leave!... Fuck him where he flosses. Asshole doesn't understand I'm building an empire around you. Finish the countdown, we got a big weekend to get to! Let's go, chop chop!No! C'mon in. We're done here. Right fellas? All through? You want a bite before you go? Something to drink?We need a bat light or something, you know a signal I can shoot up at theThey're from the Salvation Army. How the hell does someone go 1-for-8? A fucking monkey tossing darts could do better!1-for-fucking-8!I was carrying twice that in red ink before you showed up. The last few weeks I thought keep the pressure off. He'll come around. Climb out on his own. Now I figure fuck it! Time to turn on the lights! Let him see the toilet he's drowning us all in! Maybe that'll shake him up! So what do you want to know? I got three mortgages on this house, I'm gambling again and to cover my losses I just got a loan from a guy who works out of a bar on a 106th and Broadway! All this -- everything you see around you --You went 82 and 11! You were picking 80 percent -- how could I fucking not!? Trouble is I bet heavy after you went a hundred percent and rode you right into the fucking toilet! One decent weekend and I would have been set for life! One decent weekend!\"I know what the problem is!\" That's it! You came in with a big smile and said, \"I know what the problem is!\"--You can pick again! Of course!You want anything shipped from home? Your bed? Clothes? Porno collection?Blow job?Because it's important.God forgive me, you're an artist. I fucked with that. Two little winners and a couple of over/unders. That's all we need. You could phone it in. Two's nothing. Not for you. Not for Brandon. Right, Brandon? Isn't that right?These are the winners?Brandon made these picks?Sure, Angel. I need you to root for me.Because Brandon likes them.That's great.You're not gonna sit there and tell me you're ending this because you have a little indigestion or some insomnia.I made it very clear before we started what the stakes were.Wrong! Hot streaks go cold, cold streaks go hot. Bettors will climb back aboard.Sports betting's year-round.You made a career choice! I bankrolled it!Of course you stick up for him!Who's side are you on?I created the hottest sports tout this country's ever seen! I plugged him, took out full page ads, built a show around him, hooked him up with every major client I have and I will be goddamned if he's going to walk out the door and take all that with him! Why the hell am I even explaining this to you! This is between me and him! Get out!I need you to tell me how to talk to my wife? When I'm talking you'll shut your fucking toilet!Wake up.Five in the morning. Listen, I gotta fly to Vegas to meet with some clients. Hand holding thing. Keep 'em on board for the final game. Because you can do this thing, Brandon. End of the season's the perfect place to turn this streak around. I'll be back to you out to dinner. Get you back in the groove. 9:30. Nobu. Gotta catch my flight. See you tonight. Look sharp. We're turning it around.Look at that. With the leaves and all.

woman. What are you --all of 35? I have a girlfriend, she was stunning, went in to \"tighten it up a bit\" and came out with a permanent smile. Even when she cries she looks like she's laughing. Another, she's on her third eye lift. Her skin's so tight, I swear, if you put an egg shell on her butt she'd look like a baby bird.Oh yeah, first it's a tune-up, then it's something else, and one day you'll come teetering in with your new 36Cs and a stretched face and you won't be able to say how unhappy you are because of all the collagen they shot in your lips.Oh yeah, that's true. Those were the good days. Sometimes I like to just curl up on the ledge with my box of retouched photos and reminisce about rehab.I guess. Must be the coffee talking.... Brandon?I'm Toni. Walter said you'd stop by.I know.Every one.Once. Before they start work.You think?I can see that.No, do you drink?Alcohol. Are you a drinker?Smoke?Look, I'm sorry, I'm pressed for time.Really? Why not?It's my shop, I better be. Why don't you gamble?So?Well Walter could definitely use someone with a little resolve in his life.... He didn't tell you.Brandon, Walter and I are married.Walter's got a weird sense of humor.You're swift.Except for an illegal forward pass,Enjoy your daughter's party.Get out of your head, Walter. It's a bad neighborhood.It's a waste, Walter. He hardly drinks.I was a lot of things, Walter, but I was never a drunk.--Watch out, Walter, he's a fixer.Did you call home? Let 'em know how you did? How you're doing?Are you close with your parents?Is your name Brandon?What're they like?What'd the doctor say, Walter?Neither should you, Walter.I'm not raising a kid alone.What the hell was that?I'd prefer Brandon...Monday's no good because I take Julia to ballet. Tuesday I work late at the salon. Wednesday's a maybe if I can move a couple clients to after six but I'll have to check. I really want to come in with him. Listen, I have to call you back tomorrow.The doctor, thank God, put Walter,on an exercise program. I want to be there the first time he goes. Make sure the trainer understands Walter's aversion to consistency.He's always been that way.Duck, Brandon, here it comes.Don't let him steamroll you.Go on -- get to the good part, Walter.Think it over, Brandon, don't decide now.Well that's a thoughtful response. Here I was, worried you'd rush your decision.Listen to what he's asking you, Brandon.It's four in the morning.What are you doing?-- 100 years.Walter, come to bed.You're exhausted.Get in bed. Lie down next to me. Come on. Come here, Walter.Roll on your stomach for a minute.--I know. Of course you do. This is no time to sleep, Walter... Can't sleep now... Just because you're so tired...

We have a 6-year-old in the house, Walter! What the hell is going on here?Who the hell's John?You got Brandon a hooker?What the hell are you creating here, Walter?Helping him? Really? Like the others before him?Are we actually going to have this conversation? Are you completely clueless?Of what?!You really are fucking crazy, Walter!

Are you gambling again, Walter?Look me in the eye and say it.It's never over, Walter. You know that.Some of us have to work.Slow down, Brandon.Not with me in it.I stay busy.Yes it is.\"What do I do for myself?\" If you drove past my salon and went two blocks down Prospect Street you would have found me 20 years ago with a needle in my arm. I was a 5-bag a day junkie. I would have sold Julia to get high. Keeping it all on track, that's what I do for myself.What the hell does that mean? Are we talking perfection here?Yeah, that's living.It's me, Brandon. Can I come in?I need to talk to you, it's important.You need to get out, Brandon. You need to go.It won't matter.

Asked if I'd fill in.Julia did her ballet recital today. God she was beautiful.I can't believe I'm here again. I saw it coming. I just... I just couldn't stop it.He won't stop on his own. He can't.You can't fix this, Brandon.I don't think so.Brandon--Happy anniversary.They're for evening.I know.He asked me not to.I'm sure it's in the letter.What do you mean?He had enough. He wanted his life back.Yeah, loud and clear, by leaving.Yeah, tell me.No.You're missing the game.Do I have to?Really? Another \"lock of the year?\"You mean you lied to me about the trip!I guess you had the whole thing planned?Put me out there on a tray!You played me!... Brandon was right. Son of a bitch!Best pick he ever made.You were gambling with me that night, Walter. Brandon knew it. Knew you. He told me he was sure you were watching somehow. So he asked me in to spend the night, put on a show. I didn't believe him -- I mean after all we've been through -- but I figured what the hell.And now I find out you've been thinking ever since then that we did sleep together?
