I better knock, I suppose.Goodness gracious me!Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt.I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go.Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this.Oh, Artoo! Artoo, wait for me!Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no.Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt.He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself.I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things.Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this.Good morning.The message, Artoo, the message.What did he say?This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message.We're doomed.Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite.What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!I am See-Threepio, human-cy...Oh. Well, yes.I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...Disintegrated?Oh, no! Chewbacca!Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes!Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty-five thousand.Uh, oh... but what, what did I say? Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand.Because he's holding a thermal detonator.Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.He agrees!Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.Master Luke, you're standing on...Oh, no! The Rancor!Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here?Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too!Hmm. I wish I had your confidence.Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump.Sounds dangerous.\"Exciting\" is hardly the word I would use.Here we go again.Oh, I told you it was dangerous here.Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!Don't worry, Master Luke. We know what to do.Oh, Master Luke.I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o- op!!Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness!Oh, yes, Master Luke! Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication.Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect. But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.Your Royal Highness.But Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly --You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just...... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh!Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh!Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that.Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator.He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.I have decided that we shall stay here.Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me.Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me?Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea?We surrender.Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo.Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo?

Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids.I must speak with Jabba.You will take me to Jabba now!You serve your master well.And you will be rewarded.I must be allowed to speak.You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers.Han!Are you all right?Wouldn't miss it.The same as always.You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make.There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die.Easy, Chewie.Point it at the deck!Come on!Let's go! And don't forget the droids.I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.I'll meet you back at the fleet.I will.That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend.No... of course not.Master Yoda, you can't die.But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.Then I am a Jedi?Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?Yoda, I must know.Yes.Unfortunate that I know the truth?Well, I'm sorry.I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.There's still good in him.I can't do it, Ben.I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.But I had to help my friends.I can't kill my own father.Yoda spoke of another.But I have no sister.Leia! Leia's my sister.But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.Hi, Han... Chewie.Yeah, she's comin' up.All set.Vader's on that ship.I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.Quietly, there might be more of them out there.I see them. Wait, Leia!Move closer!Get alongside that one!Get him!We got separated.Hey, we better go look for her.Come on, Artoo. We'll need your scanners.There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.Chewie, wa-wait! Don't!Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. Han, can you reach my lightsaber?Han, don't. It'll be all right.Chewie, give 'em your crossbow.Do you understand anything they're saying?Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.Just tell them.Thanks, Threepio.Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?What do you remember?Tell me.I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.Vader is here...now, on this moon.I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. I have to face him.He's my father.There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.Yes. It's you Leia.Then you know why I have to face him.No, you don't. You've always been strong.Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.I know, father.It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now.Come with me.I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.Then my father is truly dead.You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father.You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.Your overconfidence is your weakness.No!I will not fight you, father.Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.I will not fight you.Never-r-r!Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me.No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here.

She's the fastest ship in the fleet.You, too.You got her warmed?No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.Yeah, I just got a funny feeling.

Ready, everybody?All right, hang on.If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.Transmission commencing.It'll work. It'll work.Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.I don't know. Fly casual.It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.They're not goin' for it, Chewie.Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.It'll take time.
