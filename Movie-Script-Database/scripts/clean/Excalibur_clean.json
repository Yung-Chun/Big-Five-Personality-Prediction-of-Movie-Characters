{"Excalibur": {"MERLIN": {"raw_line": "Lord Uther! Lord Uther!It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.Just show the sword.Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow. Speak the words.He has given. Now you must.I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.I know the storm inside you, and what it has wrought. The alliance I forged is wrecked.You will swear by your true kingship to grant me what I wish. Then you shall have it.--What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.Come.I hold the balance of all things in my summoning. Arise mists. Come fog.Mount your horse.Ride straight to the castle, across the sea of fog.Ride across! Across the bridges of desire. Your lust will hold you up. For I have just woven it into the fabric of the world. This is magic - making solid what is in the mind, and unsolid, that which is already solid.It is done. The future has found root in the present.Doing what I did for you, it wasn't easy, you know. It takes it's toll. It took nine moons to get back my strength.Now you must pay me.The child is mine, Uther. I have come for him.You didn't ask!It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child.Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...They are not weapons, my friend, but truths. You betrayed the Duke, stole his wife and took his castle, now no one trusts you. Lot, Uryens, your allies will turn against you. Give me the child, Uther, I will protect him. Go back to your war tent.Into the spine of the dragon! Uther... I loved you, mighty child.Speak of the devil!...I am Merlin. Counselor to kings. Wizard and beggar. Prophet and... I have feasted on thunderbolts, I savored my death before I got myself born. I--You are the son of King Uther, and the fair Igrayne... you are King Arthur.You called, sir?But not from your destiny.That's not why you came.'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.I'm tired. Doing magic takes its toll, you know. My arms ache terribly... Once--or is it yet to happen--I stood exposed to the Dragon's breath so that a man could lie one night with a woman. It took me ten moons to recover. I'm sure that story would interest you, since... Well, we'll have to talk about it another time. You're too busy now.It is whispered in the forest that... ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.Thank you.Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?Besides, it will be a good lesson. The best, if it's not the last.Maybe you'd like to meet the power that gave you the sword?In the great book.The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.The dragon! There...Coiled in the unfathomed depths, it emerges......It unfolds itself in the storm clouds......it washes its mane sparkling white in the blackness of seething whirlpools......its claws are the forks of lightning... its scales glisten in the bark of trees......its voice is heard in the hurricane......it is so much more than a scaly monster. It is Everything!What's this, what's this?!I never saw this...A king must marry, after all.There are maidens as fair, and fairer than Guenevere. If I put my mind to it, I could see them now, many of them, weeping for love of you, watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles. Offering you their every favor. Rich, clever--but if it is to be Guenevere, so be it.Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.You're not listening. Your heart is not. Love is deaf as well as blind.Looking at the cake is like looking at the future. Until you have savored its bitterness and its sweetness, its texture and its perfume, what do you really know? And then, of course, it will he too late.Too late...I had to weave a little enchantment on the bees so I could get some honey, and I didn't feel up to using any more magic just yet. Anyway, I was in less danger than you'll be in today.Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?The sword is broken. Hope is broken...The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly!There are infinite worlds within the infinite coils of the Dragon. In one of them, which I have not traveled, the sword was forged. I only know that the King is returned to us through the instrument of his power. The game continues!Chaos... confusion... brutes... savages... troglodytes... Stand back... make space.The moon... the sun... the stars... they spin... they turn... they circle... around us... us...You, and you, and you, take up your place. Be wedded to the world. Respect its perfection. All of you, together, be one.The knights of Galys approach the camp. It would be politic...No, no, I need air.You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?It is.Yes... sometimes......There are many powers in this world.No, no, of course not. You are young...I'm not jealous!No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.I showed you all my conjuring tricks...Maybe... maybe...At your service, sir.Good and evil; there is never one without the other.Never where you expect it, that's all I know.Boys!... boys will be boys...Flesh on flesh. You must press on the wound, Guenevere, hold it, and it will begin to bind.What is it my child?Yes.A king should be afraid, always. The enemy is everywhere. Waiting in ambush in the dark corridors of his castle, on the deer paths of his forest, or in the gray and winding paths of a more tangled forest, in here.What? The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword.All right. Truth. It must be truth, above all. When a man lies he murders some part of the world.That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks... Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.You betray the boy who drew the sword, the boy who saw the Dragon... the Dragon who moves close by, coiling and uncoiling, restless, looking down, waiting for the King to be a king...I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.I? Perhaps, perhaps. I'm losing interest, Morgana... I have helped men--or meddled in their affairs, if you would have it that way--since the dawn of time. Now let them live by their own laws. Let them stand on their own feet. The gods of once are gone forever, it is time for men... Morgana, make a man out of me. Kiss me.That I cannot.When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.They do.They don't know how close they live to the edge of delight or disas...Happiness or horror.In the folds of the earth where the forces that hold the world together are more alive, my power is strongest. Here I will possess you, as a man possesses a woman. And the god, the eunuch, the mule that I was, will be no more.Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you.What do you want? You must desire it for me to weave it.Desire it and it will be as you desire.Don't touch the walls. Come close to me.For you...I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones...It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events. But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact, I nearly didn't make it in one piece.But, I'm here.--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...I have returned, enchantress. You are beautiful, magnificent. Have you used up all the magic you stole from me to keep yourself young? Have you any magic left to do battle with Merlin?What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.You are a snake about to strike!And I am the staff that drives the snake back.I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.Fog and mist! You couldn't be that. You don't have enough magic.You are mine at last. I am the sea and you will never escape me.

Is it too late? I hurried--Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I took it.I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness.Please, Father, rise up. I was your son before I became your King... if I am King.Who is, then?Who is Merlin?Whose son am I?...Merlin... Merlin...Merlin!You saved me from the arrow...I want to thank you.Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--How? Where?What book is that?What?!And if I am to be King of everything, lord and commoner, beast, leaf and rock, I must use its voice, its claws, its power.Let's finish this with a show of force. We have no more tricks and no more advantages.You are in my hands, to slay or spare. I need battle lords such as you. Swear faith to me and you shall have mercy.You are right. I'm not yet a knight. You, Uryens, will knight me.Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy.That duty I will solemnly obey as knight and King.Owww...Ye...But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.I'm going....of course...I love her. If she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered.Who will it be? Put your mind to it, then.Guenevere...What's in them?We fought and won battles, and now one man defeats all my knights? I will go.Where is Merlin?I should have left you to fend for yourself.So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you.You know full well there is, and I go to meet it now. Come witness my revenge.Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.Move aside!Then may He give me the strength to unhorse you and send you with one blow back across the sea.I will not.Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.So be it, to the death.What horror is this? Merlin!My pride broke it, my rage broke it... Humiliation and defeat lie in ambush even for a king. This excellent knight who fought with fairness and grace was meant to win. With Excalibur, I tried to change that verdict.I have lost for all time the ancient sword of my fathers whose power was meant to unite all men, to serve the vanity of a single man.I am nothing.Excalibur! Is it true?Thanks to God, you are alive.You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.But your life and lands are far from here.And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion.Lancelot, how did you fare in the North?And you, Uryens?Lot, and you?You, Gawain, the East?The war is over. One land, one King. Peace.Your ancient wisdom and infinite sight have forged this circle, Merlin. Hereafter we shall come together in a circle, to tell and hear of deeds good and brave. I will build a table where this fellowship shall meet. And a hall around the table. And a castle about the hall.And I will marry.And the land will have an heir to wield Excalibur.Knights of the Round Table, good friends, brothers in arms. I send you on a quest harder by far than the battles we have fought together, a quest to uphold always, and everywhere, justice, honor, and truth. Each day shall bring forth a cause, and may each cause bring forth a knight.I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.Sit beside me, Lancelot.Your deeds set an example for all other knights. For your gift, ask a gift of me.I grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers....to ride out and meet them.I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here.Without Lancelot?!Enough!... What is a fair price for the smell of your ale?What does it cost to get drunk on your ale?Give me three shillings.For the smell of your ale, the jingle of his coins.Merlin, are you counselor to the King, or to my sister?Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen.The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.It is. Lords and knights of the Round Table, as her husband I say that this deed was not done by Guenevere. Who among you will champion this truth?Sir Caradoc! You!If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...Is he coming?So it is.Boy, kneel.In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make you a knight. Rise, Sir...Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me...Will I have a son?Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.They miss the battlefield. I think we do too.It is not easy for the young ones to learn knightly virtues without the hard teaching of war and quest. It is only your example, Lancelot, that binds them now.Which is the greatest quality of knighthood? Courage? Compassion? Loyalty? Humility? What do you say, Merlin?I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it?Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?You will be sorely missed. Heal yourself and come back.I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister...With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?Has no one seen Merlin?Guenevere! You are--Who will ride the labyrinths of the forest, to the very root of his soul, to the very ends of the earth, to find the secret that will redeem us from the evil that has fallen upon us, and make this chalice, and ourselves, whole again?Gawain, a dreadful fear is upon me, that we may never meet again, that the fellowship will be no more...Kay, I know your heart yearns to go, but I am prisoner to my duties, and you must be to yours, at my side.At last......Gawain and Perceval, Bors and Bohort, Caradoc and Ector, and all the others--lost to me. Only the echo of their voices remains in this empty hall. All I have left is the memory of their fellowship. Echoes and memories. I am a ghost of the King that once was... ...Mordred is real, alive, my own flesh and blood. I will see him, I must.Rise, Mordred.I recognize you only as my son, no more.Your mother told you that?I cannot offer you the land, only my love...So be it.I didn't know how empty was my soul until it was filled.Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule.I am Arthur.Guenevere, accept my forgiveness, and put your heart to rest. We have suffered to long. I have always loved you, and I still love you.Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.I never dared to hope all these years that it was in your keeping.I have often thought that in the hereafter of our lives, when I owe no more to the future and can be just a man, that we may meet, and you will come to me and claim me as yours, and know that I am your husband. It is a dream I have...Guenevere...What horror is that?I am outnumbered ten to one by Mordred's forces. Merlin, I need you at my side as you were once, my friend, to give me courage. There are no war tricks that will fool Mordred. He was weaned on blood.More than I ever did, I need you now. Where are you, Merlin? Is it true that Morgana has trapped you?...If only you could be at my side, Merlin, to see me wield Excalibur once more...What is this place? It is rumored Merlin, that you drew your power from these circles...Quiet. You'll wake the men, and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives.What is this place, Merlin?Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin!Merlin?!Of Merlin?I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.Kay, you will lead the attack. Perceval, you will stay with me.Be cautious, my brother.In this battle there is one thing I must do, that no one else can. Find Mordred and kill him.Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!Has anyone seen Lancelot?Squire! Here!Lancelot, I will save you... Don't die.You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--She is, Lancelot.But for Mordred. Where is Mordred?No, Perceval. Now it is time for me to raise my sword. Mordred, prepare to meet your death.Draw the spear from me. Do it.There is one thing left to do... Excalibur... And you must do it, Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command you.--Take Excalibur. Find a pool of calm water and throw the sword into it.Obey me, Perceval. You must act for me. It is my last order as your King. Do it, and be back!When you threw it in, what did you see?--By itself it is only a piece of steel. Its power comes from he who wields it. For now there is no one. Do as I have ordered!", "clean_line": "left tent sir stolen kay sword stolen kay excalibur late hurried sir kay needed sword stolen saw excalibur took father beg forgiveness father rise son king king merlin son merlin merlin merlin saved arrow want thank merlin help need help know yes yes know everybody lord leondegrance ally barons great knights lose means save hoping ask little magic help makes tired experience men speak book king lord commoner beast leaf rock use voice claws power let finish force tricks advantages hands slay spare need battle lords swear faith shall mercy right knight uryens knight knight knight offer mercy duty solemnly obey knight king owww ye leave tomorrow forests rebels invaders plunder shores know leondegrance daughter going course love queen dreams answered mind guenevere fought won battles man defeats knights merlin left fend stealing honey killed know meet come witness revenge aside king road knights joined arms king excalibur sword kings dawn time block way wild boast lack knight humility aside strength unhorse send blow sea fight horse foot fight avoidance mocks death horror merlin pride broke rage broke humiliation defeat lie ambush king excellent knight fought fairness grace meant win excalibur tried change verdict lost time ancient sword fathers power meant unite men serve vanity single man excalibur true thanks god alive best knight christiandom gained advantages love courage patience taught bitter lesson life lands far great heart sir lancelot champion lancelot fare north uryens lot gawain east war land king peace ancient wisdom infinite sight forged circle merlin shall come circle tell hear deeds good brave build table fellowship shall meet hall table castle hall marry land heir wield excalibur knights round table good friends brothers arms send quest harder far battles fought quest uphold justice honor truth day shall bring forth cause cause bring forth knight rise lancelot come sit lancelot deeds set example knights gift ask gift grant wish grant lady guenevere ride meet ride sir kay lancelot rest lancelot fair price smell ale cost drunk ale shillings smell ale jingle coins merlin counselor king sister answer years peace reigned land crops grow abundance want subjects enjoys portion happiness justice tiresome misunderstandings resolve day tell merlin defeated evil hides evil kingdom sir gahalt answer queen queen charge till champion steps forward fight behalf lords knights round table husband deed guenevere champion truth sir caradoc judge champion act king husband laws laws bind high low laws lancelot come coming boy kneel god st michael st george knight rise sir merlin tell guenevere returned son yes mad laughter riddles simple yes frightens miss battlefield think easy young ones learn knightly virtues hard teaching war quest example lancelot binds greatest quality knighthood courage compassion loyalty humility merlin ask poetry hasn merlin mended wound sorely missed heal come betrayed wife beloved friend knights forged wretched life like child tired toy toss aside babbling lecher trotting sister powers content ridiculed laughed lived oath king knight kill lancelot guenevere ride merlin seen merlin guenevere ride labyrinths forest root soul ends earth secret redeem evil fallen chalice gawain dreadful fear meet fellowship kay know heart yearns prisoner duties gawain perceval bors bohort caradoc ector lost echo voices remains hall left memory fellowship echoes memories ghost king mordred real alive flesh blood rise mordred recognize son mother told offer land love know soul filled ready knights battle ride king lived far long lancelot carried honor guenevere guilt knights fought causes mordred carries sins rule arthur guenevere accept forgiveness heart rest suffered long loved love forgive wife born live man life stuff future memory fellowship brief beginning fair time forgotten forgotten fair time come ride knights defend dream dared hope years keeping thought lives owe future man meet come claim know husband dream guenevere horror outnumbered mordred forces merlin need friend courage war tricks fool mordred weaned blood need merlin true morgana trapped merlin wield excalibur place rumored merlin drew power circles quiet ll wake men fight tomorrow lives place merlin years true morgana dream tell merlin merlin merlin dreamed merlin lives lives dreams dark shadowy place strong real solid speaks kay lead attack perceval stay cautious brother battle thing mordred kill lancelot lancelot seen lancelot squire lancelot save die greatest knight best men lancelot mordred mordred perceval time raise sword mordred prepare meet death draw spear thing left excalibur perceval leave wounds command excalibur pool calm water throw sword obey perceval act order king threw piece steel power comes wields ordered"}}}
