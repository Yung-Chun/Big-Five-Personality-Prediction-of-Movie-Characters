Pathetic, soulless morons.What I fear, is that our children, your children and my children...But not too little to be addicted...... calculatedly addicted, for profit, by those who would destroy this society. We do not yet know who these animals are who pray on our young, but one day we will.Well, it isn't the profits anyhow. It's something else... what you see ...If you were a diabetic, and you didn't have the money for insulin, would you steal to get the money? Or just die?I forgot it.I got a block against this stuff.You know why I've got a block against this stuff? Because this bullshit is what gets people on dope.... Slow Death. From the head on down. Well, that's it.Just this. Don't kick their asses after they're on it. Half of them, especially the girls, didn't know they were getting on anything at all. See, the pushers dissolve some reds in a glass of wine, they give the booze to an underage little chick, she passes out, then they inject her with a mex hit -- half heroin, half Substance D. Thank you.Fucking McDonaldburger's is taking over.Donna. How you doin'? It's Bob.How's your head today, man?Hey, can I get anything from you?Ten. Just ten.Oh, wow.I peed on some people today.Metaphorically peed, I mean.What I mean is, I told this group of...... biker-types, at the Foster's Freeze. I was cruising around and they said something raunchy, so I turned and said something like --I told 'em I'd rather ride a pig than a hog.Well, a pig is a chick that --They didn't try me at my job, did they?The hell you say --Fuck Barris! That cephscope cost me nine hundred dollars. I need to get home right now. But I gotta... Oh, fuck, man. Fuck fuck fuck Barris!I gotta run an errand and like that.The S.O. believes Spade Weeks has lost himself inside New-Path by posing as a junky. New-Path strips junkies of allI'm in a bad place. I wanna turn myself in for treatment.This place is the only hope I could think of. I had a friend come in here. A black dude, in his thirties --I am bad off.Okay, but listen, this black guy, my buddy, goes by the name of Spade, did he make it here? I sure hope he didn't get picked up by the pigs on the way over.Bob Arctor? He's not doing anything much. Working at his nowhere Blue Chip Stamp job, dropping a few tabs of meth cut with Death during the day.What do you mean?Fine. So I assume this means you'll be bugging Arctor's house and car?AH, FUCK!!FUCKING POPCORN POPPER! FUCK!That pain, so unexpected, so undeserved, cleared away the cobwebs in my head. I didn't hate the popcorn popper, I hated my wife and kids.FUCK!I hated my backyard,...... my front yard,...... my power mower.All the elements that made up my life were right there. And nothing new would ever happen. Like a little plastic boat that would sail on forever, without incident, until it finally sank, which would be a secret relief to all.So I ended that life and started this one. Now I dwell in a ugly world...Now I dwell in an ugly... disordered world. But this very disorder... permits... the... unpredictable to --Yeah?Come in, Barris.Why the fuck would I screw up my own cephscope?You did it?Oh, Jesus, Barris. Go fuck yourself.How about, you're a fucked-up lunatic?Get lost.You guys track down Andy and the hot scope. I'll pick you up in two hours.Dropping in on a friend.While in Long Beach today I checked in on Kim, an addict acquaintance who lives with dealer Dan Blake. My intention was to get the latest on Blake, but also to strand Barris and Luckman down here long enough for the scanners to be installed.It's me, Kimberly. Bob Arctor.Are you alone?He beat you up?Do you want him back?How long can you go without?Can't you get it anywhere else? Y'know the name of Dan's supplier? Maybe you could deal directly.Yeah.You should call the police.Kim, he'll kill you.Tires aren't...That's what he wants you to do.Thank you.Dog shit. All that misery and that's what really upset them.Shouldn't this locking ring hold the nut in place?For a second I couldn't figure it out.Maybe this is what's fucking us up, messing up our brains.Put the fucking snuffbox away!Dog shit! Do you smell dog shit?It's an illusion, right? There's no dog shit smell. How could there be dog shit in the eng...Dog shit! Dog shit! Oil. Spilled oil. Thrown oil. That's all. Maybe a leaky head gasket.Dog shit! Fuck! It is dog shit!What, Jim? What'd you say?What did Barris say just now? What the hell exactly did he just say?You goddamn Barris! I know you did it, screwed over the cephscope and now my car! You kinky freak mother bastard!I know it's him, man. I know.YOU FUCKING POISONED ME!Yeah, I hope.What kind of surprise? It's my house, Jim, you can't start rigging up --Well, what is it?You should've told me.Well, they're not going to expect it to be unlocked, so they'll go in the window.You're jiving me.We'll see when we get back. If there's a note on the door and it's unlocked, we'll know he's not jiving us.So what did you write on the note, Jim?Jesus, Barris.Strange how, now and then, paranoia can link up with reality.My God, who was here?What raid?Did you forget about the recorder, Jim?Forget to turn it on, did you?Sell the house?What reason should we give for selling?We'll just flat out say there's narcotics planted all over the place and since we don't know where, we decided to move out and let the new owner get busted instead of us.I say we tell them the truth. In fact, we can put an ad in the Times: \"Modern, three bedroom tract house, two bathrooms for easy flushing, with high grade dope stashed in all rooms.\" It's a selling point.They appear to have us.Did you smoke a joint? Before you crashed?How long have you been here?Shit, I hope it was you dreaming.How much you pay, Freck?Jim could've gotten it for you cheaper.Where's it located, Freck?What about the carb?Why is it bent?Freck bought a meth plant today.About a thousand pounds.That's a thousand pounds with passengers, a full tank of gas, and a carton of bricks in the trunk.Twelve.No. Eleven in the back and the driver alone up front. The extra weight is in the back so it doesn't fishtail.Unless you get eleven people in back.What is that, Luckman?To fix the engine. What else?The most dangerous kind of person is one who's afraid of his own shadow.I'll cruise the streets until I come across an Olds, then unbolt the carb. Like everyone else I know.The scanners will have miles of this tripped-out garbage. But it's not the stuff that happens while I'm here that matters. It's what goes on while I'm gone. So I'll split. Then I'll see what these three clowns are up to.What if I see some awful truth about the people I care about on these tapes? What if I see Donna climbing in the window and ripping me off, or destroying my stuff? Or some weird, nightmarish world beyond the mirror...I'm going out to score some beans. Luckman, is your Falcon running?Barris?I'll walk.Forget it. If I tried to drive your car, I'd press the wrong button and float up over the greater L.A. area.I just did a freaky number, not like a fantasy trip, but... So I'm kinda --My stuff?Fucking Barris. You know how he kills you? He doesn't. He waits until a situation arises where you die, and he just sits there. In fact he sets you up to die. I don't know how exactl --What?Sure. Yeah.I am?Donna, I know I can count on you to tell me if I'm getting weird or crazy or like that. Okay?Right on. Yeah. That sounds --I'll wear whatever you say.Oh, wow. That sounds good.Can a drive-in show movies in the morning?Do you ever throw anything away?How much of what you've got did you buy and how much did you steal?Like when you buy dope. Like a dope deal. When I mean by \"buy\" is an extension into the greater world of business transactions of what we have present now, with us, as dope deals.Like when you rip off those Coca-Cola truck you tailgate. That's stealing.Donna, look, you're gonna get caught, and if you got drugs in your car when they catch you, there's nothing I can do to protect you then.Nothing. I just... Please take care.Okay, cool.I love you, Donna.Hey, Donna, man, do you like cats?No. On the ground.Little spring flowers, then?Before. Before anyone.Yeah. You know me exactly, Donna. You can read me. No one knows me but you.What's wrong?Donna, can I put my arm around you. I want to hold you, okay?What?Ugly? Fuck you, Donna.Sure. Yeah. You better believe it.I'm taking off.You're too stoned to drive and you never let anyone else drive that little roller skate of yours.Too ugly.Okay.You'll have to save up for that.Who?You sure this'll happen?Hey, man, can I go with you? To Oregon? When you do take off finally?Here you go.Two of them do.I try not to be. That's why I've arranged this transaction with you.Hi.Fuck off, Barris.Where's Luckman?My axle jack?Either you pay up your back rent or get to work fixing my godamn cephscope!Barris portraying Arctor as coming off heroin.Barris up to something: pretending to be me... writing rubber checks on my account... representing me as a heroin addict. BUT WHAT IS HE UP TO?Hi, I'm here...... to pay for a check of mine the bank returned. It's twenty dollars.Yes, I am Mr. Arctor. Nobody else is.I'm sorry about this, but by mistake I wrote the check on a closed account.Also, I'd appreciate if you'd tell your husband --I'd appreciate if you'd tell your brother that I was distraught when he called and I apologize for that, too.Any extra charge?I was distraught because a friend of mine had just passed-on suddenly.He choked to death alone, in his room, on a piece of meat. No one heard him.Yes. That's true. Thanks. And thanks about the check.Yes. He was the best friend I had.Thank you. And thank Mr. Englesohn for me. Thank you both so much.Okay then, thank you.A perfect forgery. Barris has my handwriting down. How many checks has he written on my account? Evil genius bastard.What if I, Bob Arctor, wrote this check myself and just don't remember?I'm sorry to bother you again, ma'am, but I was just wondering what address do you have for that service call?Yeah, I lost my ignition key. 34881 Main Street, Santa Ana...So, Arctor's the forger, not Barris! Not deliberately, but because his brain is slushed on dope. All their brains are...... slushed and mutually interacting in a slushed way.But what is Arctor up to? Clearly the Sheriff's Office has some good reasons to focus their investigation on him. No doubt reasons I know nothing about. My job is to report, theirs to evaluate.Fucking waste of a perfectly good house. A family could live here, for Christ's sake. Oughta take it away from this fuck.Nobody home, I guess.What does a scanner see? Does it see into the head? Into the heart? Does it see into me clearly or darkly? I hope clearly, because I can't any longer. I see only murk inside and out.Any given man sees only a tiny portion of the total truth, and...Any given man sees only a tiny portion of Weh! steck' ich in dem Kerker noch? Verfluchtes the total truth, and very often, in fact almost perpetually dumpfes Mauerloch...Wo selbst das liebe Himmelschlicht he deliberately deceives trub durch gemalte Scheiben bricht!I'll be dipped.I drove by the Maylar Microdot Corporation building.One of the employees had evidently tracked the inventory out on the heel of his shoe. So they were all in the parking lot with many little magnifying glasses.They had a reward, but they lost that, too. It was a little tiny penny.About an inch high.They have a really big sign.Oh, just tell me.That's a decent idea.Right.You put a solar battery in it, it could keep walking for years. Forever.Imagine an Eskimo village. And this six foot block of hash worth... What would it be worth?More. Two billion. So these Eskimos are chewing hides when this six foot block of hash comes walking through the snow saying, \"No, I don't\" over and over again.Legends would spring up.But, see, legends build. So in a few centuries it would be, \"In my forefathers' time, a ninety foot high block of extremely good qualityAfghanistan hash worth eight trillion dollars came at us dripping fire and screaming, \"Die, Eskimo dogs!\" And we fought and fought with it and finally killed it with our spears.Kids never believe anything anymore.He got away with it? Never got caught?It's like asking what an imposter looks like. I asked a hash dealer who'd been busted once what the nark who busted him looked like --More so. The dealer dude told me the nark had longer hair than we do. I guess the moral is, stay away from guys who look like us.How could a guy do that is what I want to know, pose as a nark?Shit, I'm spaced. Pose as a nark.My brains are scrambled today. I better go crash.Do you have any hash?Just... like... the... rest... of us.Did... he say what it was like?What was on the other side?I've lost everything.He should've gone through while he had the chance. You only get one chance.That's what you're trying to do. With me now. Show me a trailer. So I'll hold out.I can't make love. My thing's disappeared. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.But what'll I do if my thing's disappeared? Will they still take me?Okay.Okay.I am an eye. I am dead. I can only look at what is front of me.Yes.Okay.Won't it wash off?Thelma.Don't you live here?Bruce.Are you leaving here?Semi-rotten vegetables.For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part......but then shall I know even as also I am known.I can't do that.Donna?!How long has Donna been here?Oh, then it's not Donna. I've been here a week. And Donna drove me here. And she was fine: sad-eyed, quiet and composed. So beautiful. Leather jacket. That purse with the rabbit's foot dangling. Just like always.Can I work with animals. I like animals. Can I work with them?I want to work with something living.I used to work in an office.Okay.Is this Jerry Fabin?! Is this Jerry Fabin?!My name is Bruce.Okay.I think I'll like it better here.I like mountains.I like air.Will I be seeing my friends?Mike and Thelma and Donna and Jerry Fabin and Luckman and Barris and --They had us memorize that as part of the New-Path creed.Thanksgiving.Mountains, Bruce, mountains.Echolalalia, Bruce, echolalalia.Why not for me?Gone.

of bread is this on the patty melt, anyway?If you go into New-Path, you'll experience symptoms that emanate up from the basic fluids of the body, specifically those located in the brain. By that I refer to the catecholamines, such as noradrenaline and serotonin. You see, Substance D functions this way: it interacts with the catecholamines in such a fashion that involement is locked in at a subcellular level. Biological counteradaptation has occurred. Nine-grain wheat.Say, is your name Patty?The waitress we had last time was named Patty. Same as the sandwich.Everything is super good.More people than you think have such problems. This is a world of illness, and getting progressively worse.Tell me, why the debate regarding turning yourself in for residence therapy at a drug rehab facility?Fabin was a special case.Oh, Bob's girl.No. He never got into her pants.It's possible Donna's on junk. Her aversion to bodily contact -- junkies lose interest in sex, you see, due to their organs swelling up from vasoconstriction. And Donna shows inordinate failure of sexual arousal, not just to Bob, but to... other males as well.But... I can show you how to lay Donna for ninety-eight cents.Donna does coke. Anybody who would give her a gram of coke she would undoubtedly spread her legs for.I, my friend, can derive a gram of coke for a total cost to me of under one dollar. From a product readily available at your neighborhood 7-11.That's a fine 7-11.Let's not forget the one on Katella with the foxy cashier to hit on.Oh, it's been sabotaged by person or persons unknown.Behold, what they've deliberately done is mix the cocaine with oil so it can't be extracted -- they cleverly call it benzocaine -- but my knowledge of chemistry is such that I know precisely how to separate the two.Now I'll freeze it, which causes the cocaine crystals to rise to the top because they are lighter than air.Than oil, I mean.The terminal step I keep to myself, but it involves an intricate methodological process of filtering.You give her a gift she gives you one. The most precious gift a woman has.There's a great deal about Bob Arctor you're not aware of. Your view is simplistic and naive, and you believe about him what he wants you to.In this day and age, with the kind of degenerate society we live in and the depravity of the individual, every person of worth needs a gun at all times. To protect himself.What it did was augment the sound rather than dampen it. But I almost have it right. I have it in principal, anyhow.Not much. Thirty bucks. I'll sell it to you.You really ought to have one to protect yourself, Freck, against those who would harm you.This one will be totally soundless.Hey, Bob. I thought you'd be sleeping.I am here to inform you, Bob, that I have formulated an initial theory as to who may have systematically damaged your cephscope with malice and may do it again.You.No, no. You... ... are looking at the person who did it. That was my complete, intended statement, which I was not allowed to utter.I mean it's my theory that I did it. Under post-hypnotic suggestion. With an amnesia block so I wouldn't rememberDon't you see, Bob, I've got the advanced, specialized, technical, electronic skills. I have access, because I live here. It all fits. What I can't figure out is my motive.I might have been hired by secret forces. It could be as big as that, Bob. As huge as that.Oh, hold on, Bob. I forgot something. I forgot my antihistamine capsules.And where are you off to?Mysterious Bob Arctor.What the hell happened, Bob?The idle screw has been turned all the way out. So when the linkage parted, the override went up instead of down.No. A special tool would be needed. A couple, in fact. I have the tools to fix this, but back at the house.So we'll have to get to gas station and borrow tools from them.It's hard to say. You should've cut the ignition as soon as you realized what happened.Dope can't screw up a carb-idle adjustment, my friend. You'd better take at least three of these. They're primo, but mild.Free theater tickets.Hey, Bob, want a lump of dog shit? To chew on?Hell, I took some too. And so did you. Didn't give us a bad trip. Besides it was so soon. Your stomach can't even absorb --Oh, I wouldn't worry too much about that, gents.But I left a little surprise for anyone entering the house. An electronic surprise, if you will.Easy. Be cool.If the front door is opened, my tape recorder starts recording.To increase the chance of them making their entry via the front door, I providentially left it unlocked.But I put a note on the front door.Yes.Of course I'm kidding, guys! Only a psychotic would leave the front door open with a note on it.I wrote: \"Donna, come on in, the door's unlocked. We...\" The note's to Donna.This way, we'll know who's been messing with us, Bob. And that is of prime importance.Interesting. Everything is exactly as we left it. They're very clever.Look at this!That roach may not be a slip-up. Maybe they were here specifically to plant dope, then phone in a tip later. Maybe there's dope planted all over this house. We're going to have to go through and get this place clean.Wait. If they see us scrambling around before the raid ---- then we can't allege, even though it's true, that we didn't know the dope was there. Maybe that, too, is part of their ingenious plan.Oh yes. The tape should be extremely informational at this point. Well, it probably wouldn't ultimately have proven that important.No. The first thing they did upon entering was switch it to \"off\".They made their move swiftly, before so much as an inch of tape pasesd through the recording head.You know, Bob, there is one thing you could do, although it would take time.I've got an acquaintance in the field.We don't know how fast they're gonna swoop down on us.No. I don't think we can afford to be that up front. Bob, you say you got a job transfer.Cleveland.Or how much. Prospective buyers might inquire about the quantity.Life is only heavy and none else; heavy that leads to the grave. For everyone and everything.How big?How big a plant?They're practically giving meth plants away.All that for ten bucks?Bent choke shaft. The whole carb needs to be rebuilt.You could put a four barrel on instead of a two, while you're at it.The idling jets could be replaced with smaller jets. And he could watch his rpms with a tach. Usually just backing off the gas pedal causes it to upshift if the automatic linkage doesn't do it.The tach needle would jump and he'd back off.Momentum would carry him past.What does this car weigh, Bob?Well, you're right then. It wouldn't have much interia mass. A thousand pounds traveling eighty miles an hour --This car fishtails?Be better, then, to have two three hundred pound bags of sand in the trunk. Then the passengers could be distributed more comfortably.If you bastards wouldn't rappity-rap on like a bunch of speed freaks, I could complete my computations and tell you how this car with its weight would handle a four barrel carb. So shut the fuck up, you assholes!What?I hear the phone ringing about the carb. I'll get it.It was a wrong number, man.Thought I would bring it with me, since I was indoors and noticed it.Especially Donna. That chick steals everything she can carry.At what individual price per stamp?That's twenty-seven hundred dollars, if my arithmetic is correct.You realize our taxes were raised by her stealing those stamps? It's one thing to steal auto parts, but when you steal from Uncle Sam --I wonder, Bob, if you can handle my car? By that mean there are --There are certain secret devices which have been incorporated --It's just that it has certain secret --I'm glad you appreciate my position.Operator, I need, I'm not sure, is it called the inhalator squad or the resuscitation squad?It is, I believe, cardiac arrest. Either that or involuntary aspiration of a bolus within the --The address, the address. let's see...Uh, thank you. No assistance is needed after all. Good morrow.You okay, Ernst?Not exactly. You did go into an altered state of consciousness for a few seconds. Probably an alpha state.You saw me on the phone, summoning the paramedics. I moved into action immedi --This is Jim.With the beard. Green shades. Leather pants. I met you at that happening at --Say, have I scored. Psylocybe Mexicana. A rare hallucinogenic mushroom used in South American mystery cults thousands of years ago. You fly, become invisible, understand the speech of animals --Five dollars a cap.How'd you make out with little Miss Big Tits?Bob, I'm sorry if I offended you.He left with your jack, so I assume he's off to knock over pay phones.Y'know, I have a sure fire way you could get into the pants of Little Miss Big Tits. For under one dollar.Yes. About that, Bob. I've already ordered resistors --Yeah?Yes, this is Robert Arctor.Oh, yes, I've been meaning to call you, but I've had a severe bout of intestinal flu, with loss of body heat, pyloric spasms, cramps...I just haven't been able to get it together to make that little twenty dollar check good, and frankly I don't intend to make it good.You heard me correctly.Think what you want. Turn out, tune out, and good-bye.We see imposters in our lives, now and then. But not posing as physicists.Looked just like us.I have evidence that Mr. Arctor is part of a large, secret covert organization, well-funded, with arsenals of weapons at their disposal, probably dedicated to the overthrow --No, I have not, sir, ever been in a --My evidence, gentlemen, which I mostly don't have with me today, consits of tape recordings I have made of Robert Arctor's phone conversations.I believe it to be political in nature, and against this country.When you examine my evidence, you will undoubtedly conclude that Substance D is produced by a foreign nation determined to overthrow the U.S., andA Miss Donna Hawthorne. On various pretexts he goes over to her place and colludes with her regularly.I've followed him in my car, sir.There's one more thing. Mr. Arctor is addicted to Substance D. His mind is deranged now. He's become dangerous.He's already having episodes such as occur with brain damage from Substance D. Deterioration in the corpus callosum.But, sirs --I might be murdered. Mr. Arctor is, as I say --That's not why I'm doing this. The man is sick. Brain damaged from Substance D. The reason I am here --Thank you, sirs.
