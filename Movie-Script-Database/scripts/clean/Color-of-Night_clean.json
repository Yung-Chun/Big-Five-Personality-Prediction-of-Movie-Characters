{"Color-of-Night": {"BILL": {"raw_line": "OK... Michelle, so you will become His Avenging Angel, and swoop down to finish me off. He stands up.Well, we are pretty much the same, Michelle. We all do it.Tend to view our lives as we were looking through a keyhole. I's a very limited view of the truth. So, we have to fill in the blanks. We invent things.You invent enemies to test your strength against. You invent gods to protect you from these enemies.Who is the enemy ? One minute you have friends, the next moment they've slipped away. You leave here and I wonder who is Michelle really hating this week. I try to remember and I can't bring it to mind. Do you know why ?Take a look in the mirror, MichelleAny mirror. Tell me what you see.Voice over. My God, it was the reddest blood I ever saw, poured around her green dress. And... Then the red disappeared...Christ, Ed. It was like a vibration of color broadcast from Hell. And then the red started to fade away.Hell, yes. It doesn't take Sigmund Freud to figure out I don't care to see the color of my patients' blood.Starts to stand up. Sure. You always thought I was a cold-hearted son of a bitch.Yes, that's right, that's right. But it's all too fucking glib for me, Larry. I cannot dispose of this woman that easily.No. I am still a romantic. I just don't have anybody to be romantic with. They want to fuck me or marry me... None of them want to love meShe loved me to death. Then she ran off and loved somebody else to death.Oh yeah !Yes, yes, I know. Very dangerous. I know and I have got something broken. I know it's gonna take some time to get fixed.I see you when I get back from Los Angeles.I'm not running away, Larry, it's just a little trip to Los Angeles. Besides, you can't really run away. It's all up here, isn't it... He shows his forehead and pretends he is shooting a bullet in it. Pow !... It's a package deal. The head goes with me.Hey Bob !I'm good...I' sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic on the freeway.You know. I'll just wait out here for a while.Oh no... Listen... I's the last thing I need right now...No, Bob... Not tonight...I'm a behaviorist.Same as Bob. We went to college together. We fought the battle at Penn State Mental Hospital, as interns...Fine, thank you, Sondra.No. I'm a psychologist and a psycho-analyst, not a psychiatrist. The Ph.D. is from N.Y.U.Very sorry. How did they die ?Well... I have plenty of problems... the biggest of which right now is jet-lag. So I think I'll pass for now, Bob.Yeah.No, I haven't.\"Way to go\"... I'm glad to hear you liked it.Bill holds his hand out, but Clark does not take it. He just nods in a friendly way and goes out. Good night. Alone, Bill flips through the books.Alone at last !...Well, nobody jumped out of the window. So maybe I am making progress...Hu-hu !He laughs. No !What's Buck's story ?How about Casey ?Well... I smell money... Lots of it... Maybe an abusive father... How am I doing so far ?Daddy pays for the expensive loft downtown, and the very expensive artistic life style, as long a junior stays in therapy.Yes, I'm a psychic when it comes to masochists. Five'll get you ten he likes to whack now and then.I was born with it. Like a tuning fork.Genuine nut-case.Volatile ! Don't fuck with a trapped rat !Yes, you may. Takes notes, there'll be a pop-quiz later !...All right, if I diagnose a schizophrenia, what do you recommend ?Now, you got it.It's all one place ?... They come near a door shaped like a giant keyhole. Goddamn... A metallic gate slides behind the door to let them in. Like peeking through a keyhole... They get down a few steps and reach a lawn. You get a very limited... view of the truth....\"Way to go\" must have gone really well !Oh, men... He laughs, looking at the luxury that surrounds him. The best and the most expensive in modern furniture. Large expensive paintings hanged on the walls. Leather armchairs. Bob types a secret code on a keyboard. Then he switch on a small TV set that shows the pictures from all the security cameras. So, how are we as we approach forty ?He takes off his jacket. I don't detect a woman's touch.She's too young for you.He sits behind the bar. Always get the clich\u00e9s and you won't be disappointed.Thanks... They clink the two bottle and drink the beer from the bottle. Good to see you, Bob !Ready to what ? We see the distorted face of Bill through the \u00abpiece of art\u00bb, or rather several distorted view of Bill's face seen through each of the individual square of glass. Bob pivot the object to have a better view of his friend. So hard to talk about... So hard to talk about... Bill pivot the object again to hide behind it. I's just a game... dumb, deceitful game. So I quit my practice. He gets up.He takes a big book on a shelf. There is a picture of Sigmund Freud on the cover. Well, I certainly lost my belief in the scriptures. He puts the book back, and with his hand, makes a masturbation gesture.There is a distinctive absence of pain. I... I cannot feel the pain that I know that I'm supposed to be feeling right now. And I think I'm going crazy... We feel that Bill is ready to cry. I'm lost, man, I think I'm going crazy. He has tears in his eyes.Do I get to warm up ?Ten ?I dunno... I was thinking of maybe twenty. He starts full speed. They are now on a minor dirt road. We can see Bob's house in the background.Wouldn't be civilized...You'll be sulking !What ?What are you afraid of ?That's not what I meant... What with the security systems, the security gates, looking over your shoulder.What do you mean ?... Death threats ?Monday night as in last night ?No... No hunch, Bob. What make you think it's somebody in the group ?Call the cops ?...He laughs. That makes sense.Yeah !About me... what ? We see them going very fast on the minor dirt road. A horse rider rides near them. What would you give a suicidal patient that's got everything ? They ride even faster while clowning, like riding on the back wheel.Out here already, huh ?Oh, shit ! You may have to... You may have to carry me in.Yeah ! Well, you know... Practice and all... Hey ! How about that : \"Learning to loose\" by Doctor Bill Capa !They are making those seats smaller, huh ? Whoo !Yes, I'm Doctor Capa.Yes...There's five patients in the group. I Can't really remember their names right now.No. Four neurotics of varying degrees and one killer. At least, that's what Bob thought.Good. Yes, Bob Moore.Right.Yes, I did.He blows on the cup. You were probing me about the patients. And I was about to tell you that I really can't help you at all. I don't really know any of these people.I really don't have a clue. I'd like to help you, but even if I could, there is an issue of confidentiality.Yes.Similar to the Miranda oath.Oh, look ! I'm sorry I can't help you. I've only been in Los Angeles four days.Yes.Usually a colleague will offer to take over the group... continue the treatment.No.Because I really can't handle that right now.He pauses before answering. I was at his house, Bob's house.Jesus Christ !... Are you going to arrest me, Lieutenant Martinez ?Do I need a lawyer ?All right !... All right !... Hold on !Oh shit !Yeah...What do you want ?You got a search warrant ?All right... Come on in...Yeah... Right... How's that ?How about that ?Jill... his wife... his ex-wife...I'll tell you said so... He walks to the shelves and put the album back where it was found. He looks at Hector. I'm sure it will mean a lot to her...I do not like guns.What's that ?Me ?...Why ?I just can't handle it right now... OK ?...What does that mean?You are one sinister piece of work. All right, I'll do it.No, you listen to me. You don't understand, Gene. Don't lie, just give the family what it wants... No... No, you don't understand. We see Bill from the back. In the rear-view mirror of the car, we see another convertible vehicle approaching with also its roof open. A young girl is driving. She comes a bit too fast and bumps into the back of Bill's car. Bill jumps and stops his car. I have to call you back. Christ ! He puts the telephone back on his hook and gets out of the car. He goes to Rose's car. She is leaning on the steering wheel. Hey !... You're right ?... Hey !... He opens the door. She stands back. She is wearing a large beige sweater.Hi, Rose !... I't nice to run into me like this !... I'm Bill Capa...Got a pen ?I just moved here... From New York... I wrote my address down, because I am not sure about this number, and how long I gonna be there, so maybe you can call me sometimes for the next couple of days.Bye !You could lie.Hi !... Who hasn't arrived yet ?If it's all right, I'd rather wait till you're all here. She's always this late ?There's something I want to tell you.You should prepare yourself for bad news...Bob's been killed.He was murdered.He was locking up here late Friday night.Yes, right here in the office.It was easier if you were here together.He was stabbed to death.He takes Sondra very gently by the shoulders and brings her back to her seat. Sondra... Sondra... Sondra... Sondra...It's OK... It's OK !Many times, Clark... More than thirty... It's all I can tell you...He sits down. I think Casey is suggesting that I... may have some plans to replace Bob... Casey sits down.No... I can't do that... Not right now...One reason is that I am more screwed up than you people are.During the following reply, Richie comes and sits behind Sondra. I know what kind of force a group can become in your life... You tell things here... intimate things that... you wouldn't tell your best friend. I'm very flattered that you would... He stops. He seems ready to cry. But the truth is : You are the people that make this work. I would be more than happy to try to find someone for you to continue this, but I cannot help you.No, that's not it, Buck.Six weeks ago, I spoke harshly to a patient. And she committed suicide... Right in front of me. Clark puts his handkerchief on his lips. Perhaps she would have done this, anyway. That's what my colleagues say... But I don't know...He is crying with big tears. And my patient... Her name was Michelle... She jumped out... of a window in my office... Ohh... So much blood... And so red... And in right time, before my eyes... the red just disappeared... it's turned to grey... So I don't see... red now... Then I failed... so I can't help you... I don't think that you want someone like me around right now...Thank you.No.Listen, maybe it was not one of the groupHey... Why... Why are we staying here shouting at each other for ? What's this place ?Makes sense. Look, I'm sorry I haven't got anything for you. I'll see you around.Yeah.NOWho say I hadn't ?They ask me to take over the group. I couldn't say no.Stop. You sent me over there.Come on !Well, it turns out that I handle it now.I appreciate your concern for my dick, Hector, thank you.No... I can't do that.These sudden irrational outbursts, Hector... Did they begin in childhood or in puberty?Am I in your face ? What an interesting choice of words ! Would you like me in your face ? You're married, Hector ?... If you wanna deal with any of these problems, I'll give you special rates.No, unfortunately I am color... Did you bug the office ?Who's there ?There she is, a little angel, dancing on the head of a pin.No.And wet !Cold or tasteful ?I can't tell you if your eyes are bloodshed.What is that ?That's right. You showed a remarkable restraint.But what if I am ashamed of what I do.Who told you I was a shrink ?How did you know ?How I look at you ?So, you have a tuning fork too.We seem to be playing the same game.Because you're the fantasy girl, aren't you? Quicksilver? The face glimpsed across a crowded room?You'll be whatever they want you to be... no substance, no rules. Light as air. So your feet never have to touch those burning hot coals the rest of us walk around on.Yeah, sort of like that.Yes, but that was part of my plan. I mean, I wanted to. Bill gives a ticket to the car valet. Thank you.No, hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait. What are you being so tough for ?I am thinking you should just let me take you home and forget about this stupid taxi.Give me your phone number and address.She floats away on her sweet young legs. Waves to him once. Drives away without a backward glance.What exactly is that?Well, it could be worse.How long have you been his guardian?So, what can I do for you ?Why would you want to take Richie out of therapy now ?Well, normalcy... Bill gets up and keeps on talking while walking in the room. Normalcy can be interpreted in a lot of different ways.Well, he's got legal problems. Richie was sentenced by the court to mandatory treatment.You know, Dale, it's hard to tell when someone's feeling pain... but I want you to know...Let me check out Richie's status. Then, uh, I'll give probation a call. Bill gets up.You're welcome, Dale. You either lift weights or work with your hands.Really. Bill sits back, but not Dale.No kidding.Chrysler.Yelling to the driver. Hey !He yells to the city worker, but, with the loud noise of his power blower, the man does not hears him and remains concentrated on his work. Hey ! Hey !... Help !... Shit ! Bill crawls back a little, then he eventually stands up. He crosses the road, and takes a big shovel in the pick-up truck. Fuck ! He crosses the road back. The snake is back in the mailbox. Hello ! Bill hits the box very hard with the shovel. Snake and mail fall on the road. Bill laughs and throws the shovel on the side of the road. I am not goin' back to New York, you hear me ? You're stuck with me ! Bill stoops to pick up the letters scattered on the road. He looks at the envelopes. Fuckin' bill. Great.He comes back to the car. He looks very angry. Oh, that's perfect ! That's really perfect ! Just like a cop ! You're never there when you need one !Somebody put a rattlesnake in the mailbox, Hector !Oh, I scared you, huh ? What the hell are you doing here ?I'm really flattered.Yeah ?What does that mean ? He dries his arms with a dishcloth.He's a good kid.Should we analyze that statement, Hector ?You're the cop. Figure it out.That's right.Yeah, that's right. There was. I admit it. He was on the way up... and I was on the way down.I bet you've seen every episode of Columbo, huh? Sound of a buzz. The two men look at the security screen. Who is it? Bill taps on the remote control, and Rose appears on the screen.Here she comes. Weightless, hanging from the sky... wearing a short dress of indeterminate color.Thank you.I can recommend someone.God, I missed you.Right now ?I'd like your food five inches to the left.Yeah, okay.He tries to read above her shoulder. Does it say why?What do you mean, \"lost track\" of them?Hi, Sondra. Someone just let me in.I didn't just walk in on my own.Bonnie. Yes.Thank you very much. Thank you. He enters the sitting-room, followed by Sondra. This is a really lovely place you have here. Yeah. He sits on a cushions-covered sofa.A lot of nice, nice things. A lot of nice art.Well, I feel like I have so much... so much catching up to do with all of you. And I know that you're very close with Richie. And I was wondering if you could tell me anything that might help me... understand him a little better.His brother Dale thinks that your \"little baby\"... should be taken out of therapy.He gets up. I think it's a mistake too. He goes to the window and looks at the children playing in a park.But he obviously seems to care for Richie a great deal. There's a big gap in Richie's life up until about a year ago. Did he ever mention a Dr. Niedelmeyer to you ?No, I didn't know that. He comes back to her. It's sticking out all over. He sits on the bench of the piano.That was quite a show he gave us in group. You think Richie has a violent streak ?You really think that I don't care about Richie ?Clark ?Hi. Chris just nods his head. Bye-bye. Bill gets out. As soon as the door is closes, Sondra literally jumps in Chris' arms, and starts giggling.Hey! Is this Dale Dexter's shop here?Excuse me.Yeah. Nobody was home. I would have phoned a... Dale shuts his blowtorch off. I would have phone ahead, but, uh, I don't have your phone number in our file.After Dr. Niedelmeyer, did Richie get another psychiatrist ?Well... that's the problem, Dale. I look at Richie, and I don't see that everything is fine. I see a kid that's on the brink.What's the bullet ?You want to talk about that ?You think he's violent ?I think you're making a mistake, Dale. This is not the time to take Richie out of therapy. If you don't like me, let's get him someone else.Yeah.Mrs. Niedelmeyer?Hi, I'm Bill Capa. I'm a doctor. I tracked you down through the Psychiatric Institute.Actually, I was wondering if I could speak to Dr. Niedelmeyer.I'm treating a young man that was a patient... of Dr. Niedelmeyer's when he was a child. His name is Richie Dexter.If I could just ask you a few questions.Just a few questions. Mrs. Niedelmeyer...He just came in and is standing by the window. He is wearing his glasses, jeans, open shirt and a light grey jacket. He turns around to speak to the group. Okay, let's get started.Today I'd like to focus on a most enlightening... and challenging topic.More or less. You see, the primary romantic relationship... in our life is often a symptom of our illness. He has seated himself in the hand-shaped armchair.We keep making the same neurotic choices over and over every time we choose a new mate. So... If you had a magic wand... if you, uh, had a wish list... and could change your partner... Sondra, how would you make them different ? What's wrong ? What's missing ?You need a minute to think about it ?He was jealous. He gets ups, walks to a cupboard, opens its door and takes a cup.Well, there's a good chance that he was the one that was sleeping around... and projecting his fantasies and desires onto you.He comes back with his cup in his hand. Fair enough. Casey, what do you got for us?How does this woman feel about you?Do you think she loves you ?Do you care, Casey ?Very good, Casey. That's good stuff.Buck, what do you got?It's not a contest.He has taken his glasses off. Anything else you'd like to tell us?Good, Buck. Richie. How 'bout you ?Okay. You want to talk about him?What would you like to be ?Have you seen a doctor ?He cuts him very curtly. Thank you, Buck. Anything else you'd like to tell us, Richie ?Very good. Hi, Clark. What would you change about your partner ?Well, it's not a total loss. He left without counting everything. He puts down the file he was holding in his hand.So you were fired.You're screwing Sondra... aren't you?It must be difficult to find someone... to measure up to your keen sense of order.Bill sneers. Nice. And what does Sondra think of this woman ?Hello ?... Hello, this is Bill Capa.Does your mommy know you escaped from the straightjacket?Goddamn it !Fuck you ! The red car hits him on the right side twice in a row. Fuck you! Bill hits the red car on its left side and remains stuck to it. They move together, and Bill tries to bring the red car as close to the curb as possible. Get the... You... Ohh! Get the fuck... The red car is so close to the curb that it snatches away the open door of a parked car, and then knocks down the shopping caddie of a woman. Fortunately, the woman is able to move away, but all her shopping items are scattered on the pavement. The two car bump again into each other and arrive into a main road. When the red car wants to hit Bill's car again, Bill stands on the brake and the red car hits a big truck carrying cars. The truck honks and start zigzagging in the traffic. The last car on the upper bridge of the truck gets loose and falls on the road. Bill barely avoids it. Another car gets loose from the truck and causes a pile-up on the road. Bill zigzag out of the pile-up, and comes to a crossing with a railway. A train is approaching. The red car is still behind Bill. Bill brakes suddenly just after he has crossed the railway, then starts moving backwards. He hits the front of the red car, and keeps on moving backwards until he brings the red car on the railway itself. The train keeps on honking to move the cars away. Hey! You wanna die ! Huh ? You wanna die ? We see the driver of the train working madly on his brake, and looking to the red car with terror in his eyes. Just before the train reaches the crossing, Bill jumps his car forward and the red car quickly moves backward. Bill stops a few feet after the crossing to get his breath back. We see the train moving behind him.I almost killed somebody out there. I mean, I had that car wedged right on the railroad tracks. Christ, man. It's a spooky feeling.Yeah, sure. Can stand a little more pain. He takes a plate and starts helping himself at the buffet.What'd she do ? Spill some wine on the rug ?Probably lost some body fluids.I think it's good. They should learn to assert themselves.If I had known it was your birthday, I'd have come by tomorrow.How come you didn't mention Buck ?Can we get in out of the rain?I don't like guns.Was it raining like this that night ?Did they ever find out who did it ?I need to talk to you. MAIN POLICE STATION - INTERIOR NIGHTOkay.How did you get in here ?What about the alarm ?It didn't go off ?No, goddamn it, there isn't someone in the car ! People are getting killed around here ! You walk around like it's goddamn Disneyland ! What if something were to happen to you ?He waits a few second before he cools down. This is my happiness mode. I'm sorry.I'm sorry. Baby, I'm sorry. This is a very nice surprise. He gives a quick look at her naked body. She laughs. Really nice. I'm sorry. They kiss.Why don't you take the biggest risk of all and give me... your phone number.Voice over. General Patton comes out of the foothills. The tank moves on Rose's pubis, then on her stomach. Oh, he's in the swamp. Oh, oh, he's in the deep abyss. The tank skid on Rose's naked skin and doesn't succeed in climbing on her breast. We then see she is lying on her back on Bill's naked body, who is also lying on this back in the bathtub. Ooh! Ooh ! And now... Oh, he's having a problem. He's up in the Swiss Alps, ladies and gentlemen. They both laugh. We see Bill's hand holding the remote control. Fire one. Fire... Oh !... A direct hit ! The tank skids into the water and stops.Oh, our, our tank fleet is crippled.It's goin' away.Hey, hey, hey, hey, please, please. I gotta get some sleep.I gotta be up...I gotta be up at 6:00 in the morning.\"Nobody,\" like Martinez ?That's the same \"nobody\" who didn't tell me Buck was a cop.What about Buck ? They enter the market.Why ?Okay.Holy shit.He follow Anderson between the stalls. Jesus Christ ! Was there an investigation ?What do you think ?He yells. Casey ! CASEY'S LOFT - INTERIOR DAYHe puts his hands around his mouth to make his voice louder. Casey !Oh, Jesus Christ. Bill succeeds in forcing the window open. A big cloud of smoke gets out of it. Casey ! Hey ! He walks through the open window. Casey!Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Shit !Who is it ? After two unsuccessful pictures, Rose appears on the screen. She is wearing very short pants, a flowered blouse knotted under her breast and a small backpack.Here she comes. Wearing a backpack on her back... making her look even younger than she is. Rose enters the room, puts her backpack down and falls in Bill's arms. She falls into his arms. And they kiss. They kiss.I don't have to be anywhere until this evening.Oh, God, this is better than normal. This is much better than normal. It's just driving me crazy, that's all. I mean, I don't really know you... who you are... what you do... if you're safe, when you're coming by. You have all the power. I just sit around here and wait for you.Yeah. I mean, other things happen, but... in the \"what I wait for\" department, you're it.Bob's wife. My ex-wife.Pretty fucked up. Rose flips the page. A picture of Bob. Oh, God. I forget that he's dead. She kisses him tenderly to comfort him.Ten years ago.Maybe. Hold on. He gets up and goes to the shelves. He start looking for another album. I don't know why he kept this hidden back here except maybe... because it had a picture of his wife naked, which leads me to believe that... the relationship wasn't as dead as they were pretending. He sits back next to Rose, and start looking at the new album. I don't know who these people are.One of my patients was killed last night. He was murdered.The painter. Casey.A little bit after.You don't want to know. He takes off his sunglasses and start getting up, covering his crotch with the towel. About a half hour before group. I'm gonna get a shower. You gonna be okay out here ?Rose.Rose ! Rose !He jumps into his car without opening the door. Rose ! Jesus !2ASB... 185...He has just come into the room. What ?He turns toward Sondra. Which one, Sondra ?He moves rapidly to the shelves. Which one, Sondra ?Hi.Hi, Buck. Buck sits down. Casey, uh... is not gonna be joining us tonight, so I think we should get started.He reads what is written on the back of the photo. \"The sociopath, lacking the restraints that... hold a normal character together, can become anything. Amorality frees her to be universally perfect. A charming chameleon with a scorpion's tail.\" Do any of you recognize... recognize this woman ? He gives the photo to Sondra.Well, you should know something about sharing, huh, Hector ? I mean, you and Buck must have shared some very tender moments... discussing his wife. Huh ? Why didn't you tell me the truth ?Why didn't you tell me Buck was a cop... not to mention a suspect in a murder case ? Not to mention you, goddamn it.He jumps on Hector. Bucks tries to take them apart. That's right, you don't have to tell me shit ! Fuckin' tell me anything, do you ? Why won't somebody tell me some fucking truth ?One fuckin' thing ! Can you do that, Buck ?I know you can't... you lyin' sack of shit ! He wants to jump again on Hector. Buck holds him back. You can't fuckin' do it !Dr. Ashland from New York with the psychiatric convention.I don't think she is a sociopath.She's been acting this thing out as if... it's the only way for her to have a life.Yes, I want to see her.In every sense.Is that what I'm doing?Anderson ! I need your help with something.I'm sitting in a restaurant last night, and I'm looking out the window... watching this woman trying to back out of a space right in front of mine.Stunning. Anyway, the next thing I know, she busted out the headlight on my car.I don't even think she knew what she did.He gets a piece of paper out of his shirt pocket and gives it to Anderson. Yeah. Thanks, man. All right. Thanks.He yells. Damn !Mrs. Niedelmeyer ! It's Dr. Capa again.I need your help, please !Mrs. Niedelmeyer, please !I need you to listen to me ! My best friend was killed. He was stabbed with a knife...... 38 times in the chest !He follows her through the sitting room. They arrive near a bay window, behind which we can see a large swimming pool. Another patient was bled to death ! I think that I might be next !I don't have anywhere else to go, Mrs. Niedelmeyer ! What are you hiding from me ? What is it ?Why won't you tell me the truth ? Edith picks up a cordless phone on a table. Bill tears the phone away from her hands. Put that phone down.Put the phone down ! Put the phone down !My patient Richie is involved...If you just help me...Why ?What about the family ?Richie. He gets nearer and puts the piece of wood down. Jesus Christ ! When he is close to Richie, he sees that his T-shirt is badly torn down and full of blood. He wants to touch it, but Richie starts moaning. Bill kneels near him. What did he... What did he do to you ?Richie... Richie... I have to see Rose. He takes off Richie's glasses. I need her. He takes off Richie's wig, and Rose's face appears.Where's Dale ?He is also crying. Was this your idea, to become Richie ?What? What happened, Rose ? Please. I need to know.What happened to Rose ?And you had to come to group.But then what ? Rose started coming back ?Oh, honey.Jesus! Oh, my God ! Bill stands up. Oh! Jesus Christ ! Jesus Christ ! He goes to the table where he had dropped the piece of wood and start looking for an appropriate tool. He finds a big hammer. That crazy bastard ! With the forked end of the hammer, he raises the nail.He feels that she is going away from him. Rose !Rose, come back ! Richie ! Richie, leave her alone !Rose. Come on.I know. Come on, let's go. He helps her to stand up, and then to walk. Let's go. Here we go. Come on. Shh. Come here. They start going down to the workshop. Here we go. Here we go. Let's move.Get back ! Get back !What are you doing here, Martinez ?Go ! Get over there ! Get over there !Let's go!You fucking son of a bitch ! Dale takes a small electric saw, switches it on and tests it on the bars of the cage. Sparks spring up. You really fucked it up, didn't ya ? Got your little brother killed.You let old Niedelmeyer do it to him.You knew what was happening...Because it happened to you before !Could have saved your little brother, but he killed himself.You failed, Dale. And you made Rose become Richie !Yeah, you did. He coughs. Why'd you kill Casey, Dale?Why'd you do it, Dale ?He snickers. The inspiration of madness, Dale.He runs after her. Rose ! Rose ! Come back ! Rose !Rose ! Rose ! Stop ! Rose ! Rain is soaking both of them, but they keep on climbing. Thunder is rumbling. A long distance shot shows the whole chimney, with Rose and Bill climbing on it. Wait ! Rose!For God's sakes, don't jump ! Rose !Rose ! Stop !He reaches the platform. No ! No. No !Wait !Rose ! No ! Stop, please ! Rose jumps on the very narrow ring which circles the platform. Just stay there !If you go, I go ! I swear to God ! I swear to God.Please, God, just come over here. I don't want you to die. Just give me your hand. Take a risk ! There's no risk in dying.

Nobod... Nobody wants to say no... I'm Sondra... How are you, Bill ?Oh, that's helpful. Very macho of youShe simpers a lot and makes strange faces while she talks. OK... My name is Sondra Dorio... and... I always marry older men but... Richie looks at Bill's feet. Bill is wearing a red sock and a green sock, which makes Richie smile. ... I am single now... and I keep... I... I want sex all the time... Clark looks embarrassed. Casey sneers. But I mean... I really do... want... a real relationship... and... sometimes, I steal thing... I mean, they're little thing... Richie put his walkman earphones back on his ears. ... It doesn't make any sense. It's hard to... You know, I... Is that OK !THANKSRichie !You are an asshole !Why don't you stop feeling responsible for everyone.She seems a bit shocked. Oh ! That's very nice !Can't you ever be serious ?...I can't stand smoke... OK ?How come you don't listen to Clark ? How come you don't do anything about this, Bob ?You smell like an ashtray.Hi, Richie !Come sit down here....She's like a daughter to me... We hang out... Meaning that... It's wonderful...Bye...She enters very rapidly through the corridor door. She seems very happy. She drops on the armchair next to Casey. She is wearing an very close-fitting overall, which is generously open on her throat. The top of the overall is very colorful and the bottom is black. On top of it, she is wearing a pink sport jacket. Oh, I'm sorry... Class was really, really really late.Where is Doctor Moore ?What's the matter ?I'm trying to pay attention... Shhh !Why ?...Her face is distorted by the pain. She puts her hand in front of her mouth. Ohhhh !Here ?...She jumps up. She goes to Clark and hits him. This man was Bob's best friend. Do you really needed exact numbers now ?Get your fucking hands off me...She is crying. What are you saying ?It's not the robbery he's an expert on, it's the rage.Maybe you should.Why ?...I have a librium...She gets up and sits down in front of Bill. She takes the cushion which was on the armchair and hugs it. You were Bob's best friend... You... you seem kind of like him... I'll be so much easier to trust you.Oh, I'm sorry.That's for sure. That's for sure. Bonnie takes one of the parcel, a large white box. Okay, okay, okay.I know. It's incredible. Look at all these bags.She seems very moved. I think... you look beautiful.Oh, yeah.Okay. Okay. She gets up from the bed to zip up Rose's dress. Oh, this is so tight.I need to find a new husband. They both laugh. Sondra goes back sitting on the bed and looking through the parcels. I need some more money.She waves the earrings in front of Rose's face. Yes, I've got them.They're so gorgeous, yes.Sondra doesn't move, feeling very embarrassed by the idea of undressing in front of her friend. Okay. She eventually gets up, an starts taking off the belt from her suit. Rose is putting her jacket on. A long silence : Sondra looks more and more embarrassed. She snickers stupidly. Rose looks at her without really understanding what's going on.She sits back on the bed. I feel embarrassed.'Cause... the way you're looking at me.No... Yes... But it's different.She takes the phone. Hello. Oh, h-hi. Um... Oh... She seems embarrassed. Rose is making funny faces. Um, mmm, okay. She stammers a little. N... My trainer's coming at 2:30, but that's... Yeah. You are? Okay !... She goes to the window and moves the curtain aside. We see Bob's car in the street. Um, oh, there you are ! Okay, okay. I'll see you in a minute !That's my analyst ! He's coming to visit me.Oh, my God. He's coming over.What's the matter ? What ?She puts the telephone back on its stand and takes Rose's arm. Well, we can. Oh, don't worry. Don't be upset. You can stay here. Really.I don't.Oh, don't be upset. She turns to Rose to look at her face.Oh, my God.Hi.She closes the front door, which had remained open. Oh... no. That was my, um... That was my girlfriend, Bonnie. Yeah.Please, come in.You think so? Thank you. She sits on a small sofa without back.She simpers a little. What did you come here for?Richie's... my little baby.That's insane!That Dale is a dangerous bastard.I don't have much to tell. Richie's okay. He's sweet. Did you know that he was... molested as a child ? She has tears in her eyes.It's fashionable. She laughs nervously. I mean, it pays well. At least, you know, you can write a book, go on Oprah.She sighs. Oh. Let's cut to the chase. Richie did not kill Bob Moore. You know... it's really swell. Snooping around here... She gets up. ... sniffing for blood on other people's hands... while pretending to help your patients ?She gets upset. Richie wouldn't hurt a fly ! Why don't you take a look at someone dangerous. Why don't you take a look at someone who could do it ! Why don't you take a look at Clark !She gets more and more upset. Clark ! Clark ! Clark is a sneaky, lying, button-down son of a bitch... who pretends to be this gentle creature ! I heard him screaming one night at Bob. It made the hairs on my neck stand up ! Anyway... I hope that they fry... whoever did it, and it takes a really long time. And then... And then a fuse blows. They have to start all over again. She sits back. Bill has been listening to her outburst without reacting. We hear the front door chimes, and Sondra's expression changes immediately. Her angry face becomes suddenly softer. She snickers and puts her tongue to her lips. Wow ! That's my trainer. She gets up and sniffs a bit. I gotta go. I gotta get the door. She goes to the front door and opens it to a very muscular young man wearing a sleeveless T-shirt. This is my trainer, Chris.I don't feel like lifting weights today.Let's do something else. She bursts laughing. Through the low window, we see Bill going down the stairs to the street. He stops for two seconds to look at the tender couple !She is - a bit lasciviously - sprawled in her armchair. Sex.Now ?Well, I don't have an attachment in my life right now. The last one sort of went to pieces. If you enjoy sex... A man thinks you're doing it with everybody.That's right. And I was as good as gold.This guy had a major projection, and he couldn't keep it in his pants. The whole group laughs. Bill smiles while pouring himself a coffee.Anyway, I do have this girlfriend. She really makes me laugh. A wish list. I wish... she was a guy.I agree.Excuse me. You think you're gonna pass today ? Don't you think that's kind of a betrayal to the rest of the group ? I mean, we're all sitting here sharing our most intimate thoughts... and you're just gonna pass today ?Your \"little problems\" ?Ah, I see. You're smiling. Is that a smile ? You think this is funny ? She gets up from her armchair. Look at you. Just look at you. Look at your hair. Buck snickers. Who do you think you are ? Huh ? You think you're God's gift to women ? Let me tell you something. You are nothing. Nothing but a shallow, rigid... self-protective, anal coward ! And I'll tell you what your little fucking problems are...I know.Hi ! Hi !...What are you doing ? Rose takes Sondra's hand and guide it under her skirt toward her crotch. Wha... No! Sondra bursts laughing and takes her hand away. Rose keeps on cuddling Sondra who tries to concentrate on her driving. Don't ! Don't !Ah !Oh, I'm gonna go change the music.She comes near Rose. Oh, my God !They do this all the time.Oh, wait. Watch, watch! No!Oh, I don't believe it !Oh, my gosh !Believe me, they can fuck. They laugh. Oh, I can't watch this anymore. I didn't see anything.Yeah.Oh, what are they doing now ?Are they gonna do it ? No !Ow !Mmm.Why ? It's wonderful.No. We can cancel each other out.Look, the sky isn't falling down.No. Let's get that silly thing off your head. There. I love your brown hair. She strokes her hair.She is very smartly dressed too, in a white suit with black collar. She sighs. I didn't read any of it. Really. I felt so bad when I got it home. I couldn't help myself.It... The Van Gogh. But I didn't read any of it. Honestly, I promise !You know, I can't stand this arguing. Really.She laughs and brings the picture to her chest. Oh, my God ! Oh ! This is my girlfriend. This is Bonnie.Yeah. Yeah.Shut up.Shut up !What are you getting at, Buck ?That's right, that's it. That's right, That's right.She bursts laughing, but she has tears in her eyes. You're lying. You're lying. You're lying. You're lying ! I don't believe you !You're lying to me ! Why are you lying to me ?You're making it up ! You're making it up !Stop it !Where's the picture ?Don't !

I'll bring the money to you, if you just get an estimate. She stoops, picks up a piece of red plastic and gives it to Bill. OK ?... Just give me a break !Oh, poor old brain can't remember its own phone number.I will.Hey !... Don't you want my address ?Hello !Hi !... Remember me ?... Fender-bender !...So... did you get that estimate ?Waow !... Nice place you got here. It's a little cold... but it's kind of tasteful, right ?You too, I guess.So...

In respect for your infirmity, I'm gonna give up wearing lipstick. Close-up on Rose putting her lipstick in her glass of water. There is something about me that I bet you find a little strange. Right ?Well, I haven't asked you what you do.Well, it's because I'd rather guess. You know, I actually get upset if someone tries to tell me before I can... figure it out for myself, you know ?Why... Why should you be ashamed of being a shrink.Well... Are you ?The way you looked at me, you know ?You... you have this kindness in your eyes. But I think you're using it to keep me away. You know, you're trying to play safe. You're trying to think of a case instead of thinking of a female.I guess we have a lot in common.Why do you say I'm playing a game?Yeah, that's... That's exactly what I am.Yeah. Sort of like... not seeing red?I was afraid during dinner that you had taken a room here... and I might have to decide whether or not to go up with you. BIG HOTEL - HOTEL MAIN ENTRANCE - EXTERIOR NIGHTOh, I need a taxi. Taxi !I'm just beginning to think that maybe I'Il...Rose walks to her waiting cab. Well, I'm thinkin' you should stay exactly where you are, 'cause... She smiles and looks at Bill's crotch. In that condition, you'd get arrested. Start another riot.Why? You want to make me fall to earth and burn my feet ? Whatever happened to quicksilver and light as air? She opens the cab's door and climbs inside. She waves to Bill.Hi. It's me, Rose. The old fender bender.It's red, poor thing.I was thinking. Maybe I should see a shrink.I feel better already.This time you won't miss.Still holding the bedposts. She speaks with a breathless voice. I want you to get dressed up... Get dressed up... All right ? She turns around to face him. I want to get dressed up.Uh-huh. BOB'S RESIDENCE - DINING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHTYou're not eating. Don't you like my food?Okay. Rose moves the plate to her left, showing her naked body though the glass table. But if you don't like this... I have something else for you. She laughs.I think it's ready.She shamelessly takes off the dress, and, as she wears no bra, she stands naked, save for her panties, in front of Sondra. Oh, the man that was staring at you in the shop... was so funny. She laughs. Sondra freezes watching the naked body of her friend. I think I should have got it in green or something.Oh ! Oh ! Lush ! She has put the white dress on. What do you think?You sure ?Come zip me up.Thank you.Oh, men. Who needs them ? Have you seen my earrings anywhere ?Oh, sweet ! Rose takes off the large rings she is wearing to replace them by the earrings Sondra just gave her. She sighs. Oh, my God. I love these. Aren't they pretty ?Try yours on.What now ? Sondra, what ?Why?Sondra... Do men look at you like that ?She bends to her. You know, Sondra... it doesn't have to be any different at all. The phone rings. Rose starts laughing. You better get that.She is looking at herself in the full-length mirror. Who's that?When she hears Sondra's last reply, Rose's carefree face becomes very anxious. He what?Sondra, thanks. Oh, thanks a lot !Nothing ! She starts gathering her belongings. If you don't know, I thought we were just going to have a nice afternoon together... maybe have dinner.She closes her purse and puts it over her shoulder. You just don't understand, do you?Nobody appreciates you the way that I do. People just use you, and you don't even see it.Rose kisses Sondra tenderly on the lips. That's more like it. Ciao.Hey. She snickers. The only piece of clothing she is wearing is a hotel room-maid white apron. Busy day ? Can I get you something ? Bill doesn't react at all. He looks shocked. No ? Okay. She crosses the room to get something in a drawer, showing her naked buttocks. All of a sudden, she seems to remember she is naked and put the two square fireproof cloths she is holding on her buttocks. Oh! I forgot about that ! She laughs then comes back to the stove, where she moves a dish. Bill's face still looks very shocked.Last time I was here, I stole the key. It was by the door.Oh ! I never thought about that.No. Um, did I make a mistake ? You have someone in the car ?She seems not to understand Bill's anger. I just thought that it would be a nice surprise, that's all. You don't look too happy to see me.She is crying. Bill comes to her and takes her in his arms. I'm sorry.I'll never take a risk like that again.She laughs and goes away from him and back to her cooking. Christ, Capa ! I can't have people tying up the phone lines. I'm trying to run a business here.Voice ironically disappointed. Oh.Yeah ?She turns around and we guess she is grabbing Bill's penis under water. How's the submarine fleet ?They kiss. Oh, you're chicken.You're chicken.She turns around to kiss him. You're chicken, chicken.I love this song.Sondra, go !Sondra, come here. Oh, come here. My God !These are your neighbors !She bends down under the window sill and get Sondra down too. They're gonna see you !Oh, this is the part ! This is the part !Oh !Oh, Sondra, go. I love this song.Sondra, through the window ! Look ! Look !I can't tell.My God ! It's gonna happen right now.Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. She sits on the bed and picks up a champagne glass. Oh, champagne.She moves her face away from Sondra. No, no, Sondra. I can't. I can't.Sondra, I'm a jinx.She sobs a little. No. I'm not who you think I am. Oh, God, I'm in love with somebody and it's all falling apart. I'm sorry.Yes, it is.Oh, God. I'm so glad that you're here. I didn't know if you'd be in.Yeah ? She opens her blouse. She doesn't wear a bra and her nipple appears. So, what color are my nipples ?Oh, God. To be normal like this all the time.She cries. You do ?Oh, my.She's pretty.She flips the page. He looks so young here. God, how long ago were these taken ?Really ? Do you have anything more recent ?She seems very worried all of a sudden. No. It's morbid. I don't want to see anymore. Let's go outside. Let's pretend it's Sunday. Yeah? You wanna?She seems very disturbed by the news. What ?She has tears in her eyes. Were you there ?What did you see ?Yeah.She jumps. Oh ! Oh ! She drops the envelope, picks up her backpack and runs out of the room.She has gone back to Rose's voice, and doesn't stammer anymore. Get away from me, please ! You'll make it worse !She cries. L-I don't know, but he'll be back ! L-I don't know where he is.No ! No ! L-It happened. It just happened.When Richie died... Dale buried the body and then he said, \"Richie, come here.\" And I told him, I told him, \"My name is Rose !\" He slapped me so hard, I couldn't get up. A-And he, he made me dress in these clothes... and h-he did things to me that made me not want to be a woman anymore. I was Richie from then on.After a while, I forgot about Rose. Then Richie got busted.They were our world. They were our family.No! Rose, Rose was too scared, so Bonnie came out. Bonnie was first.Help me, please ! Help me. Rose moves her eyes down and Bill follows her eyes. He discovers that Rose's hand has been nailed to the carved armrest of the armchair.She cries and yells. Oh, God !She goes back to Richie's voice and face. She starts stammering again. Get away f-from me!Still talking like Richie. I never get to be out a-anymore.Rose's head stands up : she is gone back being Rose. And then I met you and the fog... Started to lift. Bill takes off the other nail. It did. It did.Oh !She yells and holds Bill tightly. No ! No, Dale, don't !Dale, no !No ! No !No ! Get out !My name is... My name is Rose. He rushes on her. She shoots and sticks a nail in the middle of his forehead. Dale falls down. Rose starts screaming. No ! No ! Bill tries to get the belt off his neck. Rose raises the gun to her throat, and presses the trigger. But it doesn't work. She tries again. It still doesn't work. The gun must be empty. No !

I can't go back.Why would you do that ?Oh, Capa.She puts her hand out to Bill's strutted hand. We hear the sound of a high gust of wind, and Rose looses her balance and starts falling backward. L...
