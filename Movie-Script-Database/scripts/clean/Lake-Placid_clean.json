What was that last part?Yeah, that part. There's... somebody who's um...Oh. Oh. That's okay. Well. This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know. I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, you... you're y'know...Oh... No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm... I actually have an early lunch, so...Yes, well... famished.What do you expect, mugging me from behind?Well you shouldn't have. How did you even know where I was.I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.Really? I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?You?You?You and Kevin.You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.I'm not upset, Myra, okay. I just never thought of you as a y'know...No.Myra.I really... I should get back.Don't fuck with me!Kevin. How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.A tooth?Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?Sorry?This is what we do?Are you on drugs?I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--I'm not even a field person.This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until--I never do field work and even if I did, Maine, to look at a tooth of a dinosaur who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--I am not going to Maine. That's ridiculous.Did he say anything?And you didn't see anything?There? That's the morgue.Is the dead guy in there?Um. No, no. Let's go.I need to get a microscopic look at it.Maybe I should see...I'm fine, thank you.Well. At wakes.I can look at dead things.Wait.Okay.This... how long did this attack go on for?And this is how he came to the boat?Okay. And is there a place nearby I could go to vomit?You talk to the married couple?What kind of backup do we have?What?You have a thing against museums?Ever even been in one?What is that?And you stock these things for what, to fend off Russia?It's just that--Mosquitos. I have a thing about mosquitos.Kelly Scott.Are we all museum bigots in Maine?Yes, it did seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck. Not that it worked, obviously. It probably somehow got lodged into his body.Why are you staring at me? Do I have a smudge on my face, it would be so you not to have told me.Excuse me. One other thing, it's a small point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by him, but you seemed quick to join in.Please.What was the cause of your husband's death, Ma'am, do you know?We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?Sheriff.What is with this lake? It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.Gee.We're staying in tents?Yes, camp, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard \"tents\", will there be toilets?What?It looks like a branch.You threw it at me!!Don't throw heads at me, and stop calling me \"Ma'am\"!How big do the bears get?And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?It really is beautiful, isn't it?I was told they discriminate against people with hygiene. I never believed it.I told you.How would you know, what--So I don't like tents, why--I am a paleontologist. I also was dating my boss he turned out to be involved with a co-worker who was also my friend and for the sake of comfort, theirs, I was shipped off to Maine. I don't feel like going back yet.I'm not making it up.I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks.Oh my God.If this is who I think it is. It is.Hector Cyr. He's a rich kook mythology professor. He's done some work with our museum. He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles.Crocodiles. He's an expert on them. And if he's here... then he must think that's what's in this lake.There have been Northern sightings. But not this North.It couldn't be a crocodile.Hector. The big one has no sense of humor. And since he's the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.I never had sex with you!But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.Hector.They look scared.My hair.None of us actually saw anything. I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker.U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.Something's in that water.Oh God, worms. I got a thing about worms.Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.I'd be able to see something.Oh that's funny. That was real funny.Skipping stones. Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.I beg your pardon?I am not staying on shore.I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--That was an awful thing to say to me.I do know crocodiles and I won't get in your way. I really do want to be a part of this.Good.Hey! What is going on?You hurt his feelings. I think you should go apologize.Look. The thing about Hector... he takes this crocodile business very... he thinks they're Godly.In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.It's to make you understand him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.I'm sorry.You should take a flax pole.I'm just saying last resort.They respond pretty quick. I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.Good luck.What? Oh as if I'm interested.I asked you to be nice to him.He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them. He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.What? I don't even know the guy.Well Hector's a giant cracker.What is this?Well. He's probably rugged handsome I guess. Yeah.It shouldn't be taking so long.That was a bust.What was that?Hurry up!!Shit!! Hank!!I think. My hair. Where's Hector?! Where is he?There's bubbles over there! Look!There he is. Here he comes!Yeah. Nobody saw anything?That's probably good.Um... y'know... Yeah.I'm fine. I uh... I'm fine.Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.Excuse me?What are you talking about?Gee, that was so poetic, Jack. I'm all moist.Nice? Nice would be \"you look pretty,\" nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.You did, you--A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.Hank?Are you okay?You're cut.He was an Indo-pacific.Scales were oval. It was an Asian crocodile.He had to be thirty feet long.Why he's that big, I don't know. Why he's here... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving. Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.Hank!Yeah. I got some stuff for your cut.I wonder if he's some kind of mutant. That bear had to be surprised.It's okay.Just gotta pull it a little tighter.Father's a surgeon. I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.Keep it dry. No swimming.What? Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would... Does it show?This is the first time I've actually... y'know been in the middle of anything. I've never really even gotten dirty before, with me showers have always been preventative.Maybe. I've always read about what's happened. I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace while something is actually... y'know... happening.We should probably go to bed. Get rest, get some rest. Go to our separate beds, get some rest.Night.We seem to say goodnight a lot.Night.I'm gonna get ticks. I know it. They're drawn to me. I got a thing about ticks.What?Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.Thing we can lift it?I'm not mushing it.I'm not mushing it.That is it!!No. I keep getting hit with heads!You calm down!I'm being very calm. I'm composed. This is the second time I've been hit with a severed head, I'm entitled to complain.What?What is she doing now? Mother of God.Look ten feet into the water.How long have you been feeding this thing?A mistake.Alright, Jack!Jack!Did you want to be killed by it?Hector. What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.Excuse me?I'm no psychiatrist. But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--Oh, bullshit.No.Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?What?Okay.Good idea.They could try to tranq him on land.And how would we neutralize him?Well...He has been going after everything. It could work. But this is not a happy cow.He's floating. Take it home.If he gets close, you go up, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.He's mooing.Such a simple idea and it's working. What does that tell you?Watch out!!Hector!!We gotta get to Hector!!Did you get him?Wait.I think the drugs are kicking in.He's through fighting. Look at him.You're not okay, your leg's a mess.He heeds a tourniquet.You're gonna be okay.Yeah, you got bit. I'm gonna fix it.We need to get it some medical help. And him too.Okay. That's where they're taking the croc, Hector, they've got some big tank there.Yeah. Thanks to you.I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?Well...No, no, I'll be a while anyway. I'm gonna say goodbye to the lake.No, I actually want to stay for a little while.I'll miss you most of all scarecrow.Yeah.But we do.

A museum sent you?Did you make anything of the tooth?Let's go.Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake. Do you know how your husband died?You killed him.You gonna dig up that lady's husband?What is going on here?Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in water. On land maybe. But...Hank says he's sure.Never been to Maine before?Why are you here? Really.The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--And even if they did, I doubt he or she would have problems with tents.You don't like tents, mosquitos, look at your fingernails, you have about as much business being in the woods--They sent you out to examine a tooth, why are you out here on the on the lake?Well. You don't have to stay out here, why don't--What?Who?In Maine?If we're gonna go we better go.What's that?Are they feeding?They look like they're jumping.Same thing from Fish And Game.Well until we see it, we're not gonna be convincing too many people.Baby crocs?If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?Listen... if you really do know crocs, you should know how stealth like they are. I wouldn't be standing a foot from the water.He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.What are you doing?Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore.Whatever's out there did flip over a canoe--It's too dangerous for--You flew up here because your boss--I'm beginning to see why you were shipped off.I'm sorry but you're...Okay. We're up at six.'Night.He thinks they're what?Let's just all get some sleep.Alright, let's just drop here.Good. See ya soon.We went in different directions. That water is thick, you can't see through it!You okay? Kelly?No. U.S. Wildlife is on their way.Police want to keep it quiet, if the press gets word... lake monster. They just want us to sit tight.Are you okay?A man died. You don't have to be so tough.I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's... in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake and a monster that bites heads off... you look good.Forgive me for trying to be nice.I didn't say it like that.I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.Just forget it.You cut, we'll hold him.Hank. The little cannon you brought, get it. Guard the shoreline. Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.But why Maine and why alone? Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?Get your big gun and guard the shore. Hector. Go to your tent.Get the gun.Like little children. You okay?I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?Let's get away from the shore.Sorry.Ow. Shit.Who taught you be be a nurse?No thanks.Thank you.You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?That's why you're here.

Okay.Really--Calm down.Calm down.You gotta be kidding.Look.He just appeared.

You might think they're Godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and--'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game. They should be here by four.We might as well pack.Well, you can try talking them into that, if--Forget it.No way.So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--Even if we could tranq him-- how would we get him on land.And again. How would you get him on land?We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.Are we crazy?We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter.Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.The more he thrashes, the better.We're ready.If he tires, lift him out.It can't work.He looks like a giant tea bag.He doesn't seem to be swimming. Is he swimming?Hector.You do?Where? Where?Can you confirm visually or just radar?Okay. Lead him in. Okay, everybody up on the trucks. We aim for the stomach or side... there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide. Everybody up on the trucks.Nice and slow. Let's get ready.You wouldn't?Almost here, Hector. Don't forget to lift up the cow.You shoot on my order. If he charges, I'll be yelling \"go\" which means drivers take off. And drive fast, they can move on land. You set?Little closer. Three, two, one...Fire!!Keep firing!Shit!!Take him.Where is he?!Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!Tranq guns down, rifles up!Do not go in that water! Back us in!!If you get a safe shot...Hector. Do not move.You see anything?Go!! Drive!!Take him!!Hector, you see anything?I don't think we really want to wait for him to catch his breath.I don't care. Hank. End it.Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--Get him onto shore.Don't count on it. We better take him out.Thank God.You take care.She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.Just those two.Okay.Well... I got stuff to pack up and...You too.You wanna ride in my truck?You sure? I don't mind...If I'm ever in New York...Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and...It was... something meeting you.I thought I should say goodbye to the lake too.Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world. You found anyone in yours?So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in my world who was good for you and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.Worth a try.
