{"Dear-White-People": {"SAM": {"raw_line": "Dear White People. The minimum requirement of Black friends needed to not seem racist has just been raised to two.Sorry, but your weed man Tyrone does not count.Dear White People, apparently Morgan Freeman in \"Deep Impact\" wasn't enough. Despite two terms Obama could cure Cancer and somewhere White folks will be embroiled in protest. And he's only half Black.Talk to me.No need. Mass media from Fox News to reality tv on VH1 makes it clear what white people think of us.Dear White People I am here to burst your post-racial little bubble.Yes Oprah may have her own network, but Ann Coulter is still writing best sellers, Black kids are still getting shot for wearing hoodies, and even here the few vestiges of Black culture are under attack by conservative groups, trustees and yes our very own President Fletcher.Dear White People, thanks to the new process of randomizing housing assignments for Sophomores, some of you may be jarred by an assignment to Armstrong/Parker house.When encountering a Black person try and stay calm. Don't say things like \"what's up\" and \"my brotha\" That's not how you normally talk.Dear White People, this just in. Dating a Black person to piss off your parents is a form of racism.Oofta is as Oofta does.Just because we're colored don't mean we run on colored people time.Hate this shit.Troy we live in a world where there's a Big Momma's House 3. I don't have a chance in hell. Thank God.Troy my brother, it's broke.Troy's a legacy kid. And yet it's under his watch that Armstrong / Parker, the bastion of Black culture here was gutted. By the Randomization of Housing Act. Second years of color no longer have a say in where they go. The culture that's been fostered in this house for two decades will be wiped out in two years.This wasn't motivated by a desire to mix things up. Bring about racial and socioeconomic harmony. No, the Black kids are sitting together in the proverbial cafeteria and they must be up to no good.We sit together to protect ourselves. Over a century of houses grouped by sports affiliations, political leanings, majors, you name it. Black folks get their own house, suddenly we got a problem?This Act doesn't affect the other houses like it does ours. There are plenty of trustees, former coaches, and presidents watching out for the others. All we have is a Dean who'd rather please his massa ---- then stand up for his own. Look, I know ya'll ain't voting for me. Ya'll ain't ready and I didn't come here for that. The Black Student Union and I have brought a petition to repeal the Randomization of Housing Act. I plan on bringing it to the President and together we can bring Black back to Manchester. It'll be by the door.Event requests for the year?That's absurd.Troy. I didn't think I was going to win.Because they all have a legacy of rich and powerful allies on the board who will make sure that \"random\" works out to their advantage.The Armstrong / Parker dining hall is the epicenter of Black culture as it stands at Manchester. Only here can you commiserate, celebrate and discuss everything from Kanye West lyrics to theoretical relativism all in one sitting. Not to mention find someone who can actually do your hair.You call me the minute there's an update. Love you too mom.I always forget passwords.Good thing the one evil techno- genius thinking like that is on my side.So this is what the revolution looks like? Office hours and paperwork.Lynch mob is still there. Just re- branded itself.Want to know how this world sees you? Go to a Young Republican's meeting and bring up Welfare.What are you doing in here?On behalf of the colored folks in the room, let me apologize for all the better qualified white students whose place we're taking up.You get lost? Bechet is that way.On Pastiche? Your uninspired humor magazine?What gives you Clubhouse kids the right to come to our Dining Hall?You don't live here.You can't eat here.I'm the Head of this house. And I'm doing things my way.-- Yeah, I know who your daddy is. The same one who's been pushing to break up this House for a decade. What's wrong? Is he scared letting the Negroes gather in groups might start a rebellion on the plantation? You tell him from me...he should be.You too.Is this your house?Dear White People, stop dancing.What?Before you say anything might I remind you that I sat through Birth of A Nation, Gone With The Wind, and Tarantino week without protest.The Gremlins are loud, talk in slang, are addicted to fried chicken and freak out when you get their hair wet.I've been getting footage.I've got Radio, BSU, this Head of House thing ---- Look this thing might as well be my right hand Professor. I was busy this summer that's all.My dad. He's sick. Had to go home.-- I do --Thematically dubious?You're thematically dubious!Since when do TA's give critiques?To invoke the same feeling I get when I turn on the TV and see some so-called reality star shuck and jive for ratings egged on by no doubt white producers. Or the sassy Black secretary with no backstory or character development aside from their skin color.Blackface is alive and well in our culture. Who primarily buys hip hop? Watches Housewives of Atlanta? The same homogenized images of Black people over and over again? White people Gabe.We're an underfed community. None of this changes the fact that the vibrancy, the complexity of Black culture has been distilled into commodities and marketing schemes to be bought and sold--I am indistinguishable from the so called \"urban\" images used to amuse and market to white America.On your knees.My hair was so straight. My sweater so big. I told you about that?Yeah, it's...it's.Yeah, well...Fucking.Dear White People. Please stop touching my hair.Does this look like a petting zoo to you?Dear White People, knowing Lil' Wayne lyrics no longer earns you an Honorary Black Card. It just reminds me how often you say the word \"nigga\" when no one Black is around as is required in reciting said lyrics.The Paper Bag Tests.The Tip Test. You hit up Jelly's for a snack. Your waitress mistakes you for someone who looks like you who once ran up a thirty dollar bill and left a dollar tip.You watch all the other customers order before you do......then proceed to wait no less than forty minutes for your food.How do you tip? A...B...Or C...Dear White People in a shocking reversal using the term \"African American\" is borderline racist now.Turns out if you're too worried about Political Correctness to say \"Black\", odds are you secretly just want to call us niggers anyway and truth be told I'd rather you just be honest about it.Like, can we have a movie with, you know characters in them? `Stead of stereotypes wrapped in Christian dogma?How come the only Black movies Hollywood wants to make are ones with mammies in fat suits or Black women in pain man?How `bout you stop stereotyping yourself and put that shit out? This ain't \"Friday.\"Demonstrations can get shut down if a House doesn't sponsor them.You want me to break it down?Only a few ways colored folks survive at a place like this.\"Oofta\" is the jazz age term for Bojangle types who Blacked it up for White audiences.An Oofta modulates his Blackness up or down depending on the crowd and what he wants from them.Sort of. Nose-jobs smooth their Black edges and try to blend.Dear White People using Instagram. You have an iPhone and go on hikes. I get it.A Nose-job's worst fear is that their \"Blackness\" might cause a fuss or draw undue attention so they apologize for it or use it to self deprecate.Like I said...There's only a few ways a person of a color can survive at a place like this...Use your head Reggie. You think a rally is going to change things?We? I didn't see you running for shit Reggie.Don't \"one word\" me.Don't call me that.I'm taking my ass home.How am I supposed to know how you feel about me?I'll set up the rally.Forget your sign Dean?The role of the counter culture is to wake up the mainstream to --What about my show?Black people can't be racist.Prejudice? Yes. But not racist. Racism describes a system of disadvantage based on race. Black people can't be racist since they don't benefit from such a system.Is the New York Times a school paper?Warm milk?It's not my fault your son couldn't beat me in an election.If that's true, I'm not the only one Dean.I told you I had class.No. I mean how long do I have to talk anyway?Yeah but...you know I think the whole Malcolm X thing is your lane Reg. I'm just not --Hey. In the middle of-- -- Okay. Okay. Okay.You're so tough.I want you to wait until they've gone and then head home.Can you be somewhere else for me?The only eligible single brother on campus.I get it. Your parents owned in Harlem or something? You watched \"Do The Right Thing\" in high school and you want to prove to the world you're down?Reggie I will call you later damn! You don't know what you're talking about. Girls like me--You can't say Mulatto.Window. Go out the window.That's not a real African country.No? And who am I?Perceptive.And I was so careful...Yeah? Yeah? Yeah. It's okay. Get some sleep.His condition's stable.Gabe!I'm sorry.I wouldn't even begin to know how to do something like that.You're trying to frighten me, but I think you're the one who's scared.You damn right it is.For a genius dude you're a fucking idiot.I didn't ask for it Reggie. I look like I betrayed this house.What do you want me to do? Go over there and yell at them?This house is filled with folks willing to take up after a cause Lionel. Believe me. Never would have guessed you'd be one of them but...If I'm caught being a part of anything like this...it wouldn't be good for me right now okay?I'm done being everybody's angry Black chick.But you'd welcome it? A shot for school president.Even though I'd been expressly forbidden to do so, I wanted to do one last show. Something to sum up the moment. To savor in the pop of the post racial bubble just burst.Dear White People...I wanted to react....Know what? Nevermind.Why am I even here?As much as you hate him, you will stop at nothing to protect your master and his boy.That invite, whoever sent it should've been met with derision and outrage. Instead, a hundred people showed up and they pulled out posters and decorations and costumes they'd made for just such an occasion.Yeah. Prez made an executive withdrawal. Armstrong stays Black.Getting too dramatic man. Thinking about getting an apartment off campus. We'll see.He's recovering.We were actually on the phone last night for hours. First time we talked since the bypass. He was putting up a strong front. Teasing me about being so worried. Then came the stories about me as a little girl I'd heard a thousand times. About how independent I was.My mother worked nights so he would take me to school. And it pissed me off because he would follow me all the way to homeroom. Every time he tried to hold my hand I'd scream and pull away. He thought I was just being...difficult.But it was the kids. And the parents and the teachers. They'd see this Black girl and this white man and wonder what we were doing together. Even at nine I could feel their eyes on me. Especially at nine. It brought tears to my eyes.I was just a bratty girl, didn't know any better but-- The thought of losing him-- You know? I just feel so bad. How awful am I to do that to him? To anyone I love?Think so?So anyway. I didn't mean to say all of that. I don't know why I did.I don't know. Lunch?Think they'll let you in?Hey Lionel. With me out and Troy moving on - A/P's going to need a new head of house.Yeah.
