{"Departed-The": {"COSTELLO": {"raw_line": "I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product...of me.Years ago, we had the Church. That was only a way of saying we had each other. The Knights of Columbus were head-breakers. They took over their piece of the city.Twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get a job, we had the presidency. That's what the niggers don't realize. If I got one thing against the black chaps it's this. No one gives it to you. You have to take it.Get him three loaves of bread. And a couple of half gallons of milk. And some soup.Do you like comic books?Jeez, she fell funny.School's out. You earned it. Yeah, no more teachers, no more books.Wave to your girlfriend.Cut 'em here.Bye, bye.Do you know who I am?You met my friend, Mister French the other night.No. Come with me. I'm not the cops. I'm not askin' you.You know something, they just do not stop having the Mafia in Providence, and this can cause problems for me.Those guys you tuned up are connected down Providence. What they're going to do is come back up with some guys and kill you. Which, sure as you're born, they will do unless I stop them. Do you want me to stop them?I'm going to have my associate search you.Contra-fucking-band. Take your fuckin' shoes off.I knew your father.I'm sorry. How did he go?That was his problem.I just said he had a fuckin' problem. There's a man could have been anything.I'm saying he worked at the airport.The arm.It makes me curious to see you in this neighborhood. Regressing. And, if I can slander my own formative environment, it makes me sad, this regressing. Plus, I don't know if it's beyond some cop prick like fucking Queenan to pull you out of the Staties, and send you after me. I just can't know. I don't know what they do in...that department, anyway.Are you still a cop?You swear on your mother's grave that you're not a cop.You stop doing coke deals with your jerk-off cousin?Take it easy. Get your hand taken care of. I'm sorry. It was necessary. As for our problem with Providence...let's not cry over spilled guineas.What's this IRA motherfucker doing in my bar?Only kidding. How's your mother?We all are. Act accordingly.Do you trust him?His Uncle Jackie was.You don't trust a guy behaves like he's got nothin' to lose.Well, you're one in a million.What about your wife?She wasn't.\"Another county heard from.\"Who's the lead detective?...Good, he's a moron.I want you to get the cops to look at Jimmy Pappas for the hit. Of course he had nothing to do with it and will say so. You look inhis car...and find...the gun that did it.Have a seat, Billy.You know John Lennon?Lennon said `I'm an artist. You give me a fuckin' tuba and I'll get you something out of it'.Smart mouth. Too bad.The point with John Lennon is a man can look at anything and make something out of it. For instance, I look at you and I think what can I use you for?Get rid of this. Maybe we can work something out. Let me get dressed.So?Well, you know what the fuck a bookie does?Bingo. Anyway, I like a guy who goes around knocking guys teeth out for no reason.Here. From now on call the bar and ask for Mikey. Just Mikey. You ask for Mikey because there's no Mikey. Wait. We'll call.They don't have directional microphones.They don't have directional microphones.People looking at you make you self- conscious?Why? They're minuses. They can't tell the difference between a rock star and a career criminal.What are you soft? That's not what I said. Eat something, Jesus Christ, we got a nice day by the water. Sun's shining, gulls are up...Nice smell of ozone...You know if your father were alive and saw you, sitting here with me, let's say he would have a word with me about this, in fact, he'd kill seven guys just to cut my throat. And he could do it, which is something you may not know about William Costigan, Sr.He kept his own counsel. He never wanted money. You can't do a thing with a man like that. Your uncle Jackie needed a lot of money. But even though he got his money from me, he also would kill my entire fucking family if he saw me here with you. And I think about this.Fact is you're not a guy fresh from the zoo who wants to run a spring water distributor and I don't see you up the dog track as a general manager.You ever think of going back to school?Well that's your problem. Maybe someday you'll wake the fuck up.Good day, Fathers.You recall our chat? \"I am as God made me\", was that what you said? May I remind you, God don't run the bingo in this archdiocese.What comes before the Fall is the Summertime.How is Sister Mary Theresa doing? We had a tasty relationship before she took her vows. Enjoy your clams, cocksuckers.Yes?Too bad. Your mother worked all goddamned day. We'll just have to sit down without you and your friends.Turn off your cell phones.Check your weapons...Fitzy has the chicken...How you going, Robert?Tell him light on the starch.Government man. I'm concerned about Chinamen who think it's wise to bring automatic weapons to a business transaction.For his own good, tell Bruce Lee and the Karate Kids none of us are carrying automatic weapons because here, in this country, it don't add inches to your dick. You get a life sentence for it.If these chinks want to nuke Taiwan any time in this century, you tell them they better shape up fast and show me one million dollars.What we generally do in this country is one guy shows up with the items, and the other guy pays him. No tickee...no laundry.In English, thank you, also.The expedition continues this way.See, no surveillance here. They didn't figure we had a navy. Always figure an exit for your business partners. What with everything all dug up, you can't trust a slant to find the Mass Pike and, with or without Staties out front, frankly I don't approve of orientals driving to begin with.We depart. We didn't commit no illegalities.What the fuck is it with your phone?Was that that shrink cunt answered the phone?You better get organized, quick.Are you listening to me?Are listening to me, son? Do you like Little Miss Thing sucking your cock?So earn it. I'm gettin' the feeling we got a cop in my crew.He's one of yours. Inside. Have you seen anything?Your best? What do you think we're in, the fuckin' haberdashery business?Get you? Give you? Who the fuck do you work for?Collie, calm down or you'll shoot in your pants. I'll get you the records and whatnot. You'll have 'em but listen to me son, don't disappoint me on this, or some other guy will be putting their cock up Little Miss Freud's ass.My mother called me Francis.Oh, what did your father call you, Charlie? Oh yeah, I forgot, he wasn't around.Microprocessors...oh yeah, I heard that story. You arrested some Chinese government guy at the border carrying some light sockets or somethin'.Wouldn't you rather wipe my ass for me?If you could've you would've but I guess you like to go at your own pace.Excuse me, I've got a date with some angels.Oh yeah, be dirty.See anything you like?You're not indulging in self abuse are you?I hope you're not turning into one of those sob sisters, who wants to get caught. You're not crackin' up are you?Pick a place where any cop could see you...I own the place.You're gettin' reassigned.Where'd they put you?You're telling me, sonny boy.With everybody looking up their own ass and you looking for yourself, I put my money on nobody finding nothing.Laying low is not what I do.Okay. But Colin, I hope I won't have to remind you, that if you don't find that cheese eating rat bastard in your department so we can give him a halo, most likely it won't be me who pays for it.Maybe it's because it's always been so easy for me to get cunt that I never understood jerking off in a theatre.Who knows what's easy? Collie, take care of business.You got a girlfriend?Depends. I'm sure you know by now there's an informer in my crew. Cop. Staties or Boston Police department, I'm not sure.It ain't. Trust me. The ex-wife, an old friend or stupid...that's what brings you down in this business.Past days, case like this...I killed everybody who works for me.On the other hand, back then, it was only five...or six...and French.Give em up to the Almighty. Like that.You got something you want to say to me, William?I haven't needed \"the money\" since I took Archie's milk money in the third grade. Tell the truth, I don't need pussy any more,but I still like it.Point I'm making...you see...I got this rat...gnawing, cheese eating fucking rat...questions come up...questions...see, Bill, you're the new guy...and the girlfriend. Why don't you stay in the bar when I get the numbers. Your numbers. Everybody's numbers.Start with, you agree there is a rat?Sure, sure, all that aside...but you Bill, what would you do?Only one that can do what I do is me. You want to be me?Heavy lies the crown...sort of thing.Thank you, Jimmy. See you tomorrow.There's a boat coming in, up in Gloucester. French will give you all the details.You heard nothing?Nothing about drugs. Nothing about new guys, nothing about Gloucester?You're sure. No other departments, no codes, like that...Okay, Collie. I will.It ain't Bill. No way, he says. Thank God for Billy.You can get out of here. This is the crew for tonight.I changed my mind. Take the night off. Jimmy, get the mop.Now, when I hear Lucia, I can't stop thinking about the cocaine curtsy you did on that nigger broad's face. What?One of us was going to have to die. With me it tends to be the other guy.I don't give a fuck about Dignam.Don't get your balls in an uproar, Collie. That Irish piss-ant won't be a problem. He's so hot for me, we give him a whiff of my ass, he'll crawl right in it. Let's give him a whiff.Don't worry. I'll take care of it.Sweetheart, you're giving me a hard- on.Hey, watch your fucking mouth.The cops are saying he's a cop so I won't look for the cop. Are you soft? The next time I tell you to dump a body in the marshes, put it in the fuckin' marshes, not where some guy from John Hancock goes every Thursday to get a blowjob!Proceed.Jesus Christ.What?Get rid of them.Get rid of the fuckin' tail!Tails. Fuckin' rats. This rat shit is wearing me thin.Load it.Were you in the fuckin' car?Load.Cocksucker.Jesus Colin, grow up. Course I'm talking to the FBI.I never gave up anybody who wasn't goin' down anyway.Nobody knows nothin'.I know you, Colin. You know I'd never give you up.

And I didn't take this job in order to fuck it up, or to let anyone else fuck it up, whosoever they may be. I hand picked this group. You are my A-team so I want you to conduct yourselves accordingly.Hi, Captain. And our primary target is obviously Frank Costello. But we don't communicate with anyone else in this shop. Queenan is compartmentalizing everything in SIU. It's the right thing to do, personally I don't trust these fucking troopers either. We think we might have a problem. We think Costello's got a rat in the State Police.Yeah. Really.No. Ah...not presently. Not presently. But I'm hoping to get things...reorganized. That's it. Congratulations. Don't disappoint me.Hello Dad. I have a new job.I'm not making enough progress with Costello?Jimmy Pappas.He had a heart attack in jail and got knifed in his bed at Boston City Hospital. I believe it's been in the papers.It's a result.Cui gives a shit. It's got a bow on it.What have you got?At least one. He's one of Costello's crew.Who's the lawyer?Did he beep him?All right.Give me your phone. Turn the camera off. Turn it off.Give my your phone and turn the fucking camera off. Who's is this?

I don't know where they are going, but they do. And so do you. Call your mum.I think you need another attorney, after all, Mr. Fitzgibbon. Have a nice day.Run the last number called. That'll be his house. Whatever the location is I'll swear I surveilled him at it.

Costello, Mister French, Fitzy, Delahunt, Billy Costigan the new guy...Time is 10.46.Good morning.How was the last night in the, ah, old establishment?I'm glad to hear that. It sucked here, too.Uncle Alphonsus is in heaven. So am I.Yeah. Hey, can I...Well, we're not having this out.You don't see any pictures of where I came from. Look, I respect who you are, but not in the living room. We might have company.Why work for the state?Not forever, and you don't have to. You've got degrees...you're a hot shit... I mean, what you do, why make as much as a guidance counselor?Now you're just being ridiculous.Yes I do.Answer it. You live here.Who is it?Hello?Something for work.Nothin', nothin'. It doesn't have any power, that's all. It just happened once.Yes. Yes. As I said, she was gonna move in, so she moved in.Last time I checked, I tipped you off and you're not in jail.Yes.Yes. Yes I do.I been gettin' that same feeling.Look, I have no access to undercover files in Queenan's department. It's locked up. Queenan and Dignam run the snitches. They don't give anybody a peep. I'm doing the best...Please Frank, if you don't relax I can't relax. Let's start with this...get me all the information on the people around you last night. Everyone that works for you. Get me real first names. Get me...Okay, Frank...I'm sorry...could you please get me social security numbers, ah, I need drivers license numbers, full names, dates of birth, anything like that. Bank account numbers, everything that you don't get from a criminal record or, or a wrap sheet or a...What?No, no, no. That was a guy who works for me.Not exactly. There are certain things I will not be able to talk to you about. I cannot allow you to jeopardize an ongoing investigation. There really are things connected to my job that you can't ask about. That you don't want to know about.I will. Thank you.You still wanna stay?All right. All right. I'm coming.I don't get it.Right.Well, that's just a dream job for a cop.No.Everything's great. On schedule. She's a doctor.Oh, it's working. Overtime.Jesus Christ, Frank, I almost shot you.Frank, we got problems.I don't crack up.Why did you show up then?Why am I not fuckin' surprised. Look...How the fuck did you know that?I have to find myself.I have to find the guy you have in the department.Frank, for me, you've got to lay low.Yeah, big fuckin' daddy Frank. Lookit, Frank, what good am I to you if you don't listen to me? Queenan's compartmentalizing. He's fuckin' smart, you know that. I will find this rat if you let me do it my way. If you let me do my job.Why would you need to remind me of that? I didn't know that would I be any good at what I do? Trust me, I know how to do this.It involves lying, and I'm pretty fucking good at that, right?No.No, Frank, not a thing. And I promise you I would have heard about it.Morning.A problem?The day you wouldn't take a promotion, you let me know. And I wouldn't even have a job if you did yours.I need to know the identity of your undercovers.Morning, Captain.They are not happy with me. Especially Staff Sergeant Dignam.Fair enough. Well one of them has to be dirty, We know that, right?Who is that?Fair enough.Really? Did he get a look at him?Nothing that could help us?Any advice? Generally?This is Sullivan. I need constant surveillance on Captain Queenan, starting right now.If I wasn't with the Mass State Police. If I did it full time,law school, I'd be through in a year. I'm thinking that. If I wasn't a trooper.Nothing. Nothing. There's nothing going on. Just thinking.I got some money. Another city...I'm thinking that.I want you to know you don't gotta stay. If we're not going to make it, it's got to be you that gets out. I'm not capable I'm fuckin' Irish, so I'll deal with something being wrong for the rest of my life.Yes, go ahead.I have to follow every lead, however unlikely, however fucking painful it might be to your delicate fucking sensibilities.I have reason to believe that Queenan is Costello's informer. Follow him, and don't get made.I think I've got him. I think Queenan is meeting with him right now.Yes.What came off the roof? What do you mean something came off the roof? Go again with that information.No. Stay where you are. I need some fucking information here. What came off the building?No.I told Internal Investigations to follow him.That's internal Investigations business.I have to investigate everybody and anybody. I don't have to justify anything. Nor does anyone have to like it. I now have information...from a very good source...that Queenan may have been killed by his own undercover.Captain Queenan and Staff Sergeant Dignam here have information on this undercover, and other informants, in a locked file. I need those files unlocked.That's a lie.What?I need those codes.Your shouldn't have killed Queenan.You're crazy, Frank. You killed the guy who has all the information. And Dignam's not in the office, he's gone. He resigned.He's fucking gone. They took his papers in. He's not talking. I don't know where he is.I will.Yeah.So it is you. Thank God you're all right. We were very worried.You're talking to Sergeant Sullivan. I'm taking over Queenan's unit.Staff Sgt. Dignam has... taken a leave of absence. He's very upset. We're all very upset. The best thing would be for your to come in. We need you to come in.Don't go. You've got a tail. Two cars. Not very subtle. They won't be subtle from now on. That's what I've been trying to tell you.There's no need to go yourself, Frank.I will. All right.Stop. Stop. Pull these guys off. Tell your team to stop following Costello. We don't need to surveil him.I have it from an undercover: Costello knows he's being followed. Let our UC take him in.Queenan's guy. He called me when he found out Queenan was dead. I'm running him.No. But I can give you Costello's destination.Yes. And what he's about to do. Call off the tail, and get Special Ops. Get them on standby. We meet him where he's going. Suit up. We're gonna take this prick tonight.It's the heavy equipment warehouse Costello owns on Sheffield. He must have a container or a truck in there. Go.There's an exit on the other side. Cover it. We'll take him when he comes out.You're an FBI informant.Do they know who I am?Did you give me up?Frank, Frank, do they know about me?A son...to you? Is that what it is about, all that murderin' and fuckin' and no sons? What are you, shooting blanks?I got Costello! I got Costello here!It's not any reason for, ah...Thank you.Caller ID. On Queenan's phone. You know that guy?I'm gonna go talk to him.Good to see you Trooper.Colin Sullivan. We spoke on the phone. How long have you been undercover?I can't begin to tell you what a debt we owe you. I want you to know I'll be recommending you for the Medal of Merit.It's the highest honor we got.You want to be a cop again?A police shrink. Was that... helpful for you?I'm gonna find him. Don't you worry about that. You got anything? Did Frank, ah, say anything...Fair enough. You've given a lot. I can get you your file. I just need your password.All right, Bill. Just give me a minute. I'm gonna go in the other room. This computer's gone blooey on me.I was dreaming...I was dreaming I was dead.What's this?Really?Really?You're joking...What?Your guys shouldn't have done that.I'm now in charge of everything here. Including Queenan's informers. Theoretically. I can't unlock the files until after the brass squeezes Dignam. If the brass squeezes Dignam.He's fucking resigning. He put his papers in. He's not talking.I can explain.What do you want?Where are you?Did we not talk about this? This is my job.Put the fuckin' gun down.I came here to talk some fucking sense to you. You get a hold of yourself and put down the fuckin' firearm and act professional and I can get you your money.I can get you your...Fuck, shit...Arrested? Arrested for what. So you got tapes of what? Costello was my informant. I was his rat? Fuck you. Prove it. I say he was my informant.What is this, a citizen's arrest? Blow me, prick. Only one of us is a cop, here, Bill. Nobody knows who you are. Nobody knows who you are.I'm a sergeant in the Mass. State Police. Who the fuck are you? Nobody. I ERASED YOU.Go ahead. Shoot a cop, Einstein. See what happens.Watch what happens.That's the stupidest thing you could do.Help me.Shoot the fuckin' prick.Shoot the motherfucker!I can't wait for you to try to explain this to a Suffolk County grand jury. This is gonna be fun.Just fucking kill me.All right. Give me that.At that time, Trooper Barrigan, who I now understand to have been Francis Costello's informer in SIU, intercepted us in the lobby and shot Trooper William Costigan once in the head. At that time Barrigan retrieved Trooper Costigan's undercover weapon and shot Trooper Brown as he was approaching our location. I attempted to subdue Trooper Barrigan and in the ensuing struggle was struck several times with the Walther pistol. I was able to wrestle the weapon away, at which time Barrigan drew his own weapon and took aim at me. I was able to get off a single shot, striking Barrigan in the head. I then checked for vital signs of Troopers Brown and Costigan and discovered that they had expired.I'd like to go on record that I am recommending Trooper William Costigan for the Medal of Merit.What

Your mom must be a wonderful woman.Look at it this way, you're a black guy in Boston. You don't need any help from me to be completely fucked.To where.Rage issues and lower median IQ.Sir, I was agreeing with you about our obvious superiority to other forms of police, sir.Sir, yes sir.Sir, yes, sir, I have an idea...Uncle Jackie was a carpet layer for Jordan Marsh.That's right. I remember his funeral.That's right.What's this got to do with me?And one priest. Since you seem to know everything.You a psychiatrist?Well. Families are always rising or falling in America. Am I right?Hawthorne.I'm all set without your personal job application, Sergeant.Sir, with all due respect, sir, what is it you want from me?You sure of that?I don't have any family.You mean Stephanie who was the only one who came to my father's funeral? That Stephanie?Nothing much to it Uncle Edward.When you say \"family\", what do you mean? You?Yeah, well, maybe it would have done you some good to have a question from time to time. \"Am I an asshole?\" \"Are my kids a mess?\" \"Is my wife a money-grubbing whore?\" Those are questions. \"Have I been good to my dying sister or am I just pretending to be?\" Too late now, right?When my mother dies we don't have any connection. You got it?So what do I do?Every weekend...Sergeant.Who wants to know?My cousin.Aunt Cathy?I got kicked out about four months ago.Well. So you know.I brought your mother some pictures of my father.My mother had them. My mother's dead.No.Not for a long time. Down the cape after Rose's wedding. I think.Listen, I got twenty thousand dollars when my mother died. Insurance.In your line of work, if I gave you ten thousand dollars what could you give me back?That's what I'm saying.You fuckin' moron. What are you talking about? I'm not a cop. I'm your cousin.Why would you even think of stopping drinking?Who says?A cranberry juice.Get your hands off me.No.Yeah. Excellent. Fine.Yeah.Yeah.Cranberry juice.You guys from Providence?No.Is his real name Mister French?Is it something I can't do personally?Search me? Search me for what?Yeah. He's dead.He didn't complain.Who said he had a fuckin' problem.Are you saying he was nothing?No.I am not a cop.Yes!Thank you.Yeah, he was president before Lincoln.I'd like to squeeze some fuckin' money out of it.I won't do it if I have to wear a wire. No wires. Ever, ever, you understand me? You don't know what this is like. Micro what?What the fuck. I didn't know....Yeah, well. Fuck.He was...Okay! You gonna give me shit, it wasn't no reason----he put his hand in his coat! I don't know if he's a bookie or what the fuck he's doing...Pays you.I got it.I got it.Don't look. There's a white van across the parking lot?What, do you got x-ray vision?I don't know.Anyone not a criminal is a minus?He never, ah, I mean never?So what are talking about here?Look at it this way. It's like a tuba. I want to see if I can get something out of it.With all due respect, Mr. Costello, school's out.I'm going fuckin' nuts. I can't be someone else every day.I'm not them.Maybe I'll fucking kill you.When are you going to take Costello? What's wrong with taking 'em on any one of the million felonies you've seen him do. Get him for pissing in the street.What, are you waiting for him to chop me up and feed me to the poor?There's something wrong.Are you serious?Jesus H. Christ.Okay.It's like confession. Isn't it. This sort of thing.People make things up in confession. You know that?People are liars. They want to be stars of their little films.Do you lie?I'm asking if you lie.You lie. So, is it to do some good, to get somewhere personally, or just for the fuck of it?So, you had a parent who was a drunk?No.There was a cop leaving when I came in.Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight air of scumbag entitlement. You see cops?You should get a better job...Do they all come in and cry...your cops?Let me tell you something. They signed up to use their fuckin' weapons. Most of them. But they watch enough TV so they know they have to \"weep\" after they use their weapons. No one's more full of shit than a cop. Except a cop on TV.You want to hear about the showers?No. You sit there with a mass murderer, your heart-rate jacked, your hand...steady. That's one thing I found out about myself in prison. My hand doesn't shake, ever.I have to come here.You want the truth? Valium.What's that say about what you do for a living?I'm having panic attacks. You didn't even ask about that. Last night I thought I was having a fucking heart attack. I puked in a trash barrel on the way in here, I haven't slept for weeks.Yes. I said something true. I want some fucking pills and you close my file? I thought I was supposed to tell the truth here.If only fuckin' here.Guy comes in in pain, against every instinct of ...privacy, of, of, self reliance... that he has, and you don't help him? You send him off to score smack on the fucking street?!Two pills.Why don't you just give me a bottle of scotch and a handgun to blow my fucking head off. Are we done here with this psychiatry bullshit?What if that was a legitimate threat? .Because you're bored and tired and don't give a shit. It's not supernatural.What's this?Is it enough to kill myself?Thank you.You wanna get a cup of coffee?What about us, Frank? What're we gonna do?I'm gonna get on a plane unless you put Queenan on the phone.Why shouldn't I get on a fucking plane? Meet up? Do you actually want me dead? There's a rat in your unit. That's a fact. You just don't know it. Where's Queenan?They knew you had cameras in the building. You have a leak from the inside. It's real. Smoke him out.Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you're getting a sealed wiretap warrant for Costello's apartment. Don't tell anyone in our department but tell SIU. Flush it and see if it comes out of the pipe on my end. That's first. Narrow it down. Where's Queenan.It's me.Confucius say that?\"Something radical,\" huh?So how long you been with this guy?You love this guy?A head case or anything? I'm just curious...Then you're lucky. Considering the odds, right?Good, give him a shot.Yeah, that's because of vastly superior intelligence. Godlike, really.What would you do if he was standing right there and saw us?You take off an armored car at the Dedham Mall and what do you do. Do you pay guineas in Providence?What the fuck do you do.FBI? What the fuck are you talking about.What the fuck did you just say about the FBI?Whatever's going through your very poor, very limited, brain...I'm not going to hurt you. Just tell me what you just fucking said.Tell me what the fuck you said.Let's go.Hey, it's me.Come here.Costello is giving people up to the FBI.He gives information to the FBI. He's a protected informant. Aren't they trying to make it a Federal case? And it never gets made?No, I...I don't have a bank account.What's he doing, setting up IRAs?No, no, no. Jesus Christ.I'm not sitting in this room without a tetanus shot. I'm not staying.Why can't Ellerby's guys? SIU.Your name's on the pill label. I thought you weren't supposed to be in the book, in case of obsessive patients.Medium.I really liked our conversations. I've been...regretting that we didn't continue...our conversations.Thanks. If this is inappropriate... I can leave.You moving in or out?Yeah, I know.Yeah. Yeah I would. Thank you.Sugar? No...Hedging your bets?Decision.Move in with your boyfriend?Yeah, I think so.You don't have cats.I like that. That's good.No. No. What does that matter?What about the FBI.Stupid...Well, that leaves me out.Better safe than sorry, I suppose.I look around at your guys. They're all murderers right? I think \"could I do murder?\" And all I can answer myself is, \"what's the difference\".Yeah, that's my point. You accuse me once, I put up with it. You accuse me twice, I quit. If you make me fear for my life, I put a fucking bullet in your head as if you were anybody else.You're seventy fucking years old. One of these guys is going to pop you. As for running drugs, what the fuck. You don't need the pain in the ass, and they're going to catch you. And you don't need the money.Is there something you want to ask me, Frank?You said there is one. I base most of what I do on the idea that you're pretty fucking good at what you do.How many of these guys been with you long enough to be disgruntled? Who needs more money than you pay them? You don't pay much, you know. It's almost a feudal fuckin' enterprise. The question is, who thinks that they would do what you do better than you?I probably could be you. I know that much. But I don't want to be you.I thought I was on for that.Huh?Right. I'm going home. He's playing with his new boys.Later.He's moving something with all new guys. I don't want to tell you what or where. It might be disinformation. It probably is. Just keep following him. I need to see you today. No. Today.Look down the car.Got me?Any reason you'd have a tail?I'm watching a guy...Okay. Get off at South Station. You wait there for ten minutes. After I leave I'll text message you the address where we'll meet. I'll make sure you don't have a tail.I told you, he's got dope coming in, I don't know where. He's getting spooky, Captain...He's crazy. I just saw the man. He had blood all over him. I can't get any more information for you. I can't trust it. He's not including his regular guys... I'm telling you, he's gonna find out who I am. He's gonna fuckin' kill me, I know it.Yeah? What about the FBI?What?You were fucking followed.Costello's people.No. One of the cops he's got inside tipped him.They'll be on the elevators, too.What'll you do?What the fuck happened? I came to meet you.Boss told me to go home.I was in a fucking grocery store with no signal. When I got a signal I got the call. What the fuck do you want. Was I there or was I not there? Huh?Jesus Christ.When you're dead it makes no difference where they put you.What's that?Yeah, so?He's dead. I'm going home.I tried to call you a few times.It's okay, okay, I know.You called this number on a dead guy's phone. Who are you?Who are you?Let me talk to Dignam to confirm it.How do you know you don't have a tail?What if they took one off and put another one on, Frank?Frank told me to check out the back. You guys go ahead.Yeah. \"Trooper\".Long time. Long fuckin' time.I just want my identity back.No, being a cop's not an identity. I want my identity back.You'll have to excuse me. My only contact has been with a police shrink.What are you gonna do about the rat in this building?I'm all done being a cop. I just want to get my money and go home.The password's my name, William Costigan, Jr. They gave it to me in case something happened to them and I had to explain myself to someone like you.I know. I'm not here to...I'm not here for that. I've got something to...to give to you...something I need you to keep. For me.I need you to be my friend here and not ask any questions. That's for you to hold.Only you. Open this if I'm dead or if I call you and tell you to open it. Please do exactly what it says. Exactly what it says, please.I'm sorry to show up here like this. There was no one else I could give it to. I'm sorry. There was no one else.Whatever you have to say, really think about it, and if you still want to tell me, tell me in two weeks, all right?Costello recorded everything. He put all the tapes in a little box and kept them with his lawyer. That was his insurance. His lawyer came to me. Costello trusted me the most. Imagine that you rat fuck. Sound quality good enough? I was a little worried.I want my identity, you two-faced rat prick.Three o'clock. Where Queenan died. You keep your cell on.Get your hands up. Hands. Hands.What did you say?You didn't come here to talk, you fuckin' maggot, you came here to get arrested.Get up and shut your fuckin' mouth.Would you shut the fuck up.You erased me?What would happen is the bullet would go right through your fuckin' head.What, you think you're gonna get the parade? The bagpipes and bullshit? Fuck you. I'm arresting you.Shut up, shut up, shut the fuck up. I don't give a fuck if these charges don't stick. But I'm still fucking arresting you.[You are what you do.] Get up. I said get the fuck up.I called you. You specifically. You know who I am. I'm not gonna shoot. I told you to meet me downstairs.Where's Dignam? I told you to bring Dignam!He was Costello's rat. I got evidence. Tapes.
