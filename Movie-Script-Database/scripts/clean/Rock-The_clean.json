Things I couldn't do while you were here. Maybe you would have approved. Hell, I know you wouldn't have. I've tried everything and I can't seem to get their attention. But now they'll learn how it feels on the other side. Let's hope it elevates their thinking.Held better be. This is a security inspection.That's the idea, Colonel.Ten men who could have been terrorists are out there doing whatever they damn well please to your compound, Colonel. Here you sit with your ass chained to a fucking radiator. This is not a tight ship. I would not want to be in your shoes in the morning.Not today. You go ahead.I think so.Deploy as planned, Captain.Hello Ladies and Gentlemen. You are my prisoners. I have no intention of harming you. You will be fed regularly. That is all you need to know for now.First: I am holding eighty-one civilian hostages on Alcatraz Island. Make an excuse to their families and do not alert the media or there will not be eighty. Second: fifteen guided rockets armed with V.X. poison, are currently aimed at the population of San Francisco. I will call again at 0-hundred hours and state my demands.Brigadier General Francis X. Hummel.At ease, Gentlemen. It is traditional for me to meet with my officers before an operation. The heart performs one thing, the legs another, the brain another - all better function together or the body becomes ill, is prone to disease. Major Baxter, Gunny Crisp and I have been on the front lines since 'Nam.' Captain Hendrix was my adjutant in the Gulf. Get a haircut, Pete, you're lookin' like a beatnik. You and your men are new to me.I'm well aware of your service records, Captain, they are excellent. I want to be clear on why you - why all of us are here. You both stand to profit from this.This country has places where wrongs are redressed, Captain Darrow: They are called courts of law. In the military, they are called Courts Martial. This country has places where lessons a-re leaned. They are called schools. Am I confusing you?The only accurate term for what we are doing here is treason. Plain and simple. An insurrection against a government to which we have sworn allegiance. Everyone in this room must understand that.The question is what kind of traitor are we. Coward or lion? Benedict Arnold, or Thomas iefferson? I have posed that question to myself, have answered it, and my conscience is clear. Have all of you?Within thirty-two.hours you will leave this country and not return. All of you can live with that?Well, I cannot. So, regardless of what happens on this island in the hours ahead, I will stay. The men exchange surprised glances.Yes, Captain. And I plan on conducting my own defense. it will make the O.J. Simpson trial look like an episode of \"Perry Mason.\" Take your posts, gentlemen. Semper fi.Hello Al. Howlre Judy and the kids?I'll come straight to the point, General Kramer: Eighty-three Force Reconnaissance Marines have died under my various commands. Forty-seven in northern Laos and southern China ...Who is that. Identify yourself.How old are you, white House Chief of Staff Sinclair.Well White House Chief of Staff Sinclair, by your ninth birthday I had led over two hundred incursions into China and personally killed that many of the enemy. General, put some duct tape over Mr. sinclair's fat, ignorant mouth. He has shit for brains and he is wasting my time.Eighteen others died in covert, illegal operations in Chile and El Salvador. Remember the Gulf War. Those pretty \"smart bomb\" pictures on C.N.N.? My men lased those targets. Ten were left to rot outside Baghdad when the conflict ended - and let's not even mention Mogadishu, gentlemen. No benefits were paid to their families; no medals conferred. These men died for their country and they weren't even given a coddamn military burial. This situation will not stand: you will transfer 100 million dollars from a Grand Cayman \"Red Sea Trading Company\" account to an account I designate. From these funds, reparations of one million dollars will be paid to each of the 83 marines, families. The rest of the money will pay for my outfit's expenses. Am I clear?Identify yourself.You'll be particularly interested: It's a slush fund where the Pentagon keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales.If you want the money back, you'll have to tell the attorney General and the boys down at Justice where it came from. Good luck.Someone please gag that man. Alert the media, I launch the gas. Refuse payment, I launch the gas. It is just after midnight. You have 36 hours - all of today and half of tomorrow, until 12 noon - to transfer the money. Don't even consider the standard counter measure, General.Hummel.Don't tell me your problems, tell me your solutions.Well he'd better give me a goddamn assurance ...That you, Sinclair? What exactly do you do at the White House? Answer the presidential phone? Wash the presidential limousine? Are you his golf caddy, Sinclair?You want respect, you child, you coffee server? Let's talk about Dave Ridgeway.A twenty-two year old marine tortured to death by a communist death squad in the El Salvadoran jungle. His mother and young wife were told by the Pentagon that he went A.W.O.L. Let's talk about the respect he got.Then let me tell you what is: The most lethal poison gas known to man into San Franciscols business district. You have twelve hours to deliver the money or be prepared to reap the whirlwind, gentlemen.Royce, Scarpetti, Gamble, Starling: get to the west end of the island on the double. Think we have visitors.Tell 'em to stay out there.Drop your weapons.Commander Anderson, if you have any concern for the lives of your men, you will order them to safety their weapons and place them on the deck at their feet-Your unit is covered from an elevated position, Commander. I'm not going to ask again.Don't do anything stupid, Commander. No one has to die here.That's a nice speech, Commander. I heard plenty like it in the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill. They all added up to zero. Pretty words aren't gonna get you out of this, Commander. Now abort this mission. Goddamn it, abort.HOLD YOUR FIRE HOLD YOUR FIRE ....I never wanted this. Jesus christ.CAPTAIN, HOLSTER THAT SIDEARM.You have a made a terrible mistake and more of our brothers have died in vain. Let's not repeat this.Rodent problem, people. Let's flush the pipes.Gamble, Starling. Come in.Privates Gamble and Starling, come in.The morgue. Hummel and Baxter exit quickly.Hendrix! Take Royce and Scarpetti!Attention Navy Seals, attention.Congratulations. You've taken some things of mine. I can't convince you to return them so I'll put on someone who can.Tell them your name and age.Good Mr. Henderson, continue ...Convinced? Mr. Henderson hopes so. You have two minutes.I thought I'd been in the service a long time. Name and rank, sailor.You're a long way from England, Commander Mason.How's that?Do you have some unique knowledge of this prison facility, Commander Mason?How's that?Well you're some kind of joker, Mason. Maybe you're a lunatic. Are you of sound mind, Mason?Give me the guidance chips.That was stupid of you.You seem like a bright man, Commander. Bright men understand necessity.\"Where there is no law, there is no transgression.\" The Bible. Romans, Chapter 4, Verse 15.The American Constitution was written by traitors, Commander. Traitors against a government founded on injustice and tyranny and stupidity. I see little difference in my motivation.Do you, Commander Mason?Frye, Crisp, go!Time.I heard you Captain.Not yet.I'm aware of the time, Captain.They're going to call.I... I don't understand this.Atom?Seventy thousand peqple... I didn't... i didn't ever...Launch coordinates 675 dash 439.Fire.Careful son.

What's your education?Excellent. What do you know about V.X. gas?No Goodspeed. It's not a training exercise.The following is a state secret. Disclose it to any party and you will be subject to prosecution. His name is John Mason. A British national incarcerated on Alcatraz island in 1962, escaped in 1963.I'm telling you facts, Agent Sanchez. Do not argue and do not question. He was recaptured and sent to San Quentin, from which he escaped in February, 1976. He's been held at Wolfburg since. He has no identity. He does not exist. Understood? I want one thing: how he escaped Alcatraz - specifically the route he took through the island's tunnels.Don't even entertain it. This man laughs at strong arm tactics. dodium pentathol doesn't work either.Because I'm willing to give him what he wants, GOODSPEED - a full pardon.Sanchez - try subtlety.I ask for an interrogator and what do I get ...Real subtle, SANCHEZ...Impressive, Sanchez.He's already had you for the first course. Go.Don't answer that, GOODSPEED ....Don't give away the farm, Goodspeed.No. You'll give it to me. Give it to me, Reynolds.Show Attorney Reynolds outside there's a car waiting for him. And SANCHEZ - I'll handle the next stage.I'll decide what's legal, Goodspeed.You're out of your depth, Goodspeed. You are on a need to know basis and you do not need to know.I personally picked this suite. Only one exit.That's all you get.without these he can't stab you in the throat.You cocksucker you dislocated my shoulder and cost the city of San Francisco ten million dollars. You try to escape again and Agent Chaney here will break your legs.He knows every inch of those tunnels, Commander.What if he went with you?I'll handle that. Chaney.You're not cooperating, John. Maybe this will help. I'm sure you're curious about what's happening on Alcatraz. Twelve United States Marines - a terrorist rogue force - have seized it. They've aimed fifteen poison gas rockets at the city. Enough poison gas to kill every man, woman and child in San Francisco. Yes, John, including your daughter.Get him some gear. He's going to the Rock. Goodspeed!If mason's still alive, it's not over.1962. J. Edgar Hoover is head of the F.B.I., some say the country. It's no secret the esteemed Mr. Hoover kept microfilm files on prominent Americans and Europeans. de Gaulle, British members of Parliament, even the Prime Minister. The man had dirt on everyone in the world,The British sent over their best operative, John Mason, to steal it.Our agents caught MASON at the Canadian border but with no microfilm. It's never been found. So Hoover held him without trial. The British claimed they didn't know him.He died in 1972. She wasn't born yet Today it's a different Bureau and no one wants to touch this.John MASON has been incarcerated without trial on American soil since 1962. He knows our most intimate secrets of the last half century. The alien landing at Roswell, the truth about the J.F.K. assassination.John MASON was an S.A.S. trained killer, one of MI-6's best operatives ever - John MASON was one of the most dangerous men on earth.Goodspeed, this is Director Womack.
