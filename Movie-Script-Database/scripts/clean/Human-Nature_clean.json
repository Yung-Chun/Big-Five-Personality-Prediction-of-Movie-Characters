{"Human-Nature": {"LILA": {"raw_line": "I'm not sorry.I'm not sorry. So I spend the rest of my life in jail. So what? I've been in jail my whole life anyway. A jail of blood and tissue and coursing hormones......a jail called the human body.My soul held prisoner in this reeking, stench-ridden bag of bones and entrails. A bag of feces and piss and fibroid cysts in my tits and precancerous moles on my sun-damaged back...At least now I'll be able to blame the state, not God, for my incarceration.My story begins when I was twelve.Something terrible happened when I was twelve.Oh, I had sexual urges. I had the urge to merge, officers. Inside I was 100% Grade A female. But what self-loathing I felt! Who would have someone as repulsive, as unladylike as me? I did everything I could to shield the world from this repulsiveness.Nothing! I'll be out in a minute!It's embarrassing, okay?Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?At sixty dollars an hour, electrolysis was not a feasible solution. I explored my alternatives.I remember once coming across a painting of Mary Magdalene entirely covered with fur. I guess that's where I got the idea that maybe the Catholic Church might be a place that encouraged excessive hair growth in its women.So I became a nun.Heavenly Father... ...please let this hair go away.But my prayers were always so selfish.I tried being a lesbian separatist.But I guess I just wasn't attracted to women, even hostile, man-hating, hairy ones who wore sensible shoes.For a while I was a professional circus freak.During the holiday season, they made us wear costumes.Ho ho ho.Ow! You little fuck.Aside from the great dental, this occupation was not pleasant.They say the holidays are difficult for a lot of people.I decided there was something poetic about killing myself with a razor blade.The way that mouse looked at me. There was no judgement. It didn't care if I had hair all over my body. I was just what I was. I felt so free. Do you understand what I'm saying?Birds and squirrels and rocks and trees didn't seem to judge my hair. I felt at peace when there were no humans around. I figured out a way to spend as much time as possible with no people around. I became a nature writer.Last night I almost died on this mountain top, and the irony is I had never felt more alive.I knew it was coming when in late afternoon, a thunderhead drifted over, sneaking in like kids through the back door of a movie theater, forced casual. It turned the sky a queer shade of green. A green that said \"watch out, baby, this is gonna hurt like hell.\" I could've hightailed, but that would be cheating. Part of the Nature experience is recognizing its mastery over you, your smallness in the face of it.As Nietzsche said, what does not kill me makes me stronger, and that goes double if you're a woman.I became a successful nature writer.Then I became a famous nature writer. I said to myself, fuck humanity......and I became a recluse. I had a menagerie of animals at my house. They loved me because I was me. They loved me on the days I shaved. They loved me on the days I didn't. For a while this was enough.By the time I was thirty I was very, very horny.I had to have a man in my... life. At any cost. I would become what I needed to become to achieve this. I would become a hairless lie.I was rich enough for electrolysis by this time, so I began the long arduous process of having each inappropriate hair burned out of my body at the root.This is when everything changed, and this is where my confession really begins.Ouch. Yeah?I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.Always. Ow.Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.Shut up and tell me.Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.What do you mean?Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?Won't he be able to tell?God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, \"Ewww. A slug.\"You've got to respect that.Where?That's not necessarily a bad thing.I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.You are a therapist, right?I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.How's it going?Paper or cloth?What's the larger experiment?Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?I'm not sure.We are animals after all.I really like him, Rose. He's so... ...passionate about his work.Really?It looks wonderful.Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish...I'm sorry?Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.Boy, this is good!No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.You do?You really enjoy my company?I like you, too, Nathan.Yeah But I have some peculiarities also.Like nothing.I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something. Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.One night stand?Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.I have a friend you might like to meet.Three foot one.Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.And I think I'm going to.It's lovely to finally meet you, Mr. and Mrs. Bronfman. I've heard so much about you and I've seen you in photographs from Nathan's childhood, but it's nice to meet you in the flesh. I must say, you look exactly the same as in the photographs.Nathan!Goodness, you two look exactly as you did in those old photos.I'll be out in a minute.You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.Do you?Do you? Oh do you, darling?Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!I don't think so. Why?Yes, darling.Of course.Fifteen.Yes, darling.Yes.Absolutely.That's very funny.It was a flash of white. I ruled out deer immediately. Too... upright.Did you see that?I don't know. Something.No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.Come on.He bolted.Who are you?You don't understand my language, do you?I take it back, you do understand my language.Oh God.I think he's feral.He looks perfectly fine.I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...What?Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.Oh God, I have no one. Nothing. You give me this beautiful gift, this glorious sunset. But with no one to say \"isn't that a beautiful sunset\" to, it becomes meaningless, just another stupid sunset. They happen everyday. So what?All right.Nothing. Be right out.Who is it?Who is it?Who from work?Who is it, Nathan?Nathan, I...It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!Oh God, why... do... I... have... to... be... like... Oh, no! Oh, shit! Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? Who's there?You are an animal.I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.So, how's it going today?Honey, can we talk tonight? You know, about stuff? Things have been so strained for the past three weeks, since you know, and I just want to talk.Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.It would just be helpful to know.Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.Do you like my new look?I'm trying, you know. I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.Really?Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl!Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!Oh! I didn't see you there, sneaky boy! You're like a boy sneaking in...You remember that from my book? I'm touched! What's wrong?I'll make it. I'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's going to be so great! Scotch on the rocks, right? Just kidding. I know what you drink, mister. I know what you drink. Voila!How's work?No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this project, but I've come around.Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...Such as my man and how to please him! Such as making wonderful dinners for my man! Such as looking pretty for my man! And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!I had sold my fucking soul.That was wonderful!Well, I'm tamed, Dr. Bronfman.Oh boy!It's okay, Puff.It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.You just have to control it. We're not apes.Very well.Absolutely!Should I come with?Ummm. It's good.You were gone a long time.So he's doing okay?That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his \"mad\" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore! Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?And what did you do tonight, honey?And what did you do tonight, honey?Do you know what I gave up to be with you?I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?How's that for ladylike, Nathan.For two weeks I holed myself up in a motel room. I didn't even know who I was. My world had crumbled. There is nothing that makes you feel dirtier than finally deciding to sell your soul and finding no buyers.No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking \"do not disturb\" sign on the fucking doorknob?Go the fuck away, Rosie.Rose, please go away.How'd you know where I was?Your brother should have his license revoked.Why didn't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair?Oh, Rosie.Yeah. I gotta get myself together. I want to look good. If I'm gonna fuck with Nathan, and I am, I want him to want to fuck me when I do it.Ready!Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.Eat shit, thumbtack dick! Thank you, Frank. You're the best.See, Frank and I are kindred spirits. We both know what it's like to be shunned because of our appearance. We both know how easily that turns into self-hatred.Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.Oh, Rosie.Shut up, you.I'm really glad you two found each other.I'll be in touch.Gotta go.Stay.Out.Bad.Get up.Take off your clothes.We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.You what?Good. I'll show you how, apey.Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason.You lose. Any answer is the wrong answer.You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you.It was paradise. At least for a tiny little while.Ugnh.Oook. Oook.Ooka.Puff, don't.Then I shot Nathan.He's dead.No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.That's what I'm counting on.Okay.

It's odd. When I was alive I knew -- maybe it was all I knew -- but here sorry is meaningless. Love is meaningless. Jealousy is meaningless. Ambition is meaningless. Everything that motivated my every breath while I was alive is meaningless now. I guess that's how I can be sure I'm really dead.I have to say I always hated apes. Of course I don't any longer. I don't even know what hate means now. But while alive, I hated apes. I blame my parents. I mean, I don't blame them. I don't know what blame is, really, anymore, but I think they influenced me in my ape-hating tendencies.Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.As do I.They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.I have to say that I'm not there yet.Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing. I've been seeing someone. A therapist.No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.Ergo if I can teach table manners to mice, I can teach them to humans. If I can teach table manners to humans, I can save the world.I began going to a therapist when I was in my thirties, because I felt that I wasn't enjoying life the way my friends were. After a time my childhood came up.I don't think so. No.Why do you ask?You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...My God! The fork! The fork!Tell her, Harold... It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.No biggie.I'm sorry that I became so upset.It's only that I really enjoy your company and...Yes, and...Yes. Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty and it only mars your... I'm sorry. I'm being critical.It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...You do?I don't care. I don't care! Like what, for example?Lila moved in with me. Did I love her? I thought so. But from my new vantage point I realize that love is nothing more than a messy conglomeration of need, desperation, fear of death, insecurity about penis size, and the self-involved, ego driven need to collect other people's hearts. Not that I judge it. Listen, I don't want to be dead yet. Is there any way to...No I suppose not. No biggie. Anyway, Lila moved in. We had our problems, but we both wanted love so badly, we turned a blind eye.Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.Lila's a nature writer, mother.Of course she does, mother.What are you doing in there?I'm sorry about my parents.I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature.Of course. I simply love the... naturalness of it all.Why certainly!That's a great idea.Terrific. Can't wait!Shaving cream?Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?Oh, and the sun block?What SPF, sweetie?Perfectomundo! We are ready! Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that. Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?Flares?We could call it \"Quit Bugging Me, Sunny.\" Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.I love you so much.What?A deer?It might behoove us to turn back at this point.If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person. Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.This is the way to get ticks, Lila. This is it. Bingo! Lyme Disease! You've hit the nail on the head here.Oh for God's sa...Oh my God! Is he dead? Please put something on.You'll catch cold. It's cold. What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.Actually, I just had an amusing thought.Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?It's perfect!Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote Janet Jackson.Belonging to something, a person or a society, is a basic human craving. We are communal creatures. This poor soul has no one, nothing......what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon...Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw him in the trunk.Good morning.Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?Good morning... We need a name for him, don't we?You decide. Today is your day.Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?Good morning, Puff Bronfman. I'm Dr. Bronfman and this is my assistant Gabrielle. We're your mommy and daddy while you are here.How about some salad, son?Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...No. Don't be silly. It's just...Not at all.Of course not.There there.Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.What are you doing in there?Hello? Oh, hi... Gabrielle!Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.Absolutely, Gabrielle. Someone from work! Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly.Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?Look, Lila, when I'm on a work...Your entire body?You have to shave? Like an ape?Don't quibble. You know what I mean.Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!I have to think! I have to think!I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. How could I find myself in this mess? This is a mess. This is not a situation I understand. This is a mess. How do I extricate myself from this mess? Is my girlfriend a man? I don't understand. This is not part of any plan. She deceived me. She has hair. But am I being fair? So what if she has hair? Who am I to judge? I have hair. But I'm supposed to have hair. I am a man. Men are supposed to have hair. But poor Lila. Think of what she's had to go through. The courage she's had to have in the face of this abomination of nature. I should love her all the more. I should love every hair on her body. I mean, she doesn't mind that I have a mortifyingly small...Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think. God, Did I hang up on you?No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.Oui. Now you've got me talking French.I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?Our...? Oh! He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.When you were a little French girl?That would be good.Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.Yes. Happy happy.I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all.I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.It's true. I wouldn't lie.So soft. So smooth. I'm sorry. It's just...Was that okay? I mean, was I able to... satisfy you?Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.I'm glad you're female. Do you think our boy witnessed the primal scene?Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.Excellent, Puff. Now, the lady you're with excuses herself to go powder her nose.Perfect. Perfect, Puff!Shit. Hi, honey.Good. Making progress.Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.Okay, we'll have dinner tonight.Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye. What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.Funny. I still feel guilt. Even dead. One would've hoped... But alas. You know, I really did love Lila. But with her... problem... and then when Gabrielle revealed her feelings. And Gabrielle was so... conventionally female. And she had an accent. I was lost from that moment on. But Gabrielle was right. I couldn't admit it to myself, this shallowness of character, let alone to Lila.Of course not.No.I'm just preoccupied.Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.Shh. It's okay. It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.Sure. Of course.That's great.That's great. It's a great color for you.So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.No, why?Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha.I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?Bravo, Puff! Bravo!Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?Gabby, what is it?Fine.Very well.My little French.What is it?Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.I love you so much, Gabrielle.But I don't know how to leave Lila.Now there's a butt, Nathan....the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.Thanks.Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.I guess.Have you?Really?How come?Such as what womanly things?I let her sell her soul. I stood by as she did it. It's inexcusable. At the time though I thought it might help.Bravo to you, Puff!Unnhh.Urgh.I'm glad... my assistant.I think he's ready.Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.No, Puff! Bad!This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.Puff, no!Lila! Tell him.Thank you very much for that.Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.Lila?Good. You're doing fine.Excellent.You're doing very nicely, Puff. I'm pleased.Great...Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.Tomorrow, the acid test.Very well.Puff, why don't you order first?Puff, I'm proud of you! You did remarkably well under difficult circumstances.And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.Even better.Free to come and go as you please. There's some \"mad money\" in the night table drawer.I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.Nah. You just relax. How's the book?I won't be long.Hi. It's Nathan.I just want to talk.Please. Just one minute of your time.I've got some things to tell you.Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.Well, I think...What?Well, look, I'm sorry to have bothered you.God, you're beautiful.No. You look so beautiful.I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.No!That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts! I love you, Gabrielle.Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.Can you ever forgive me?Hey.Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.Shit.I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.Yes.Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.Lila...Thank you. Let's get right to it. Here we have Puff the day of his capture.And here he is today, a scant three months later.Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage.Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?Come on, you two. Let's go celebrate!Now the tango.I think it went swimmingly today. You two make an excellent team.Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.No, Puff. This man is a midget. In actuality, they prefer to be called \"Little People.\" Isn't that correct, my good man?This Little Person is actually a fully grown adult man, Puff, believe it or not, who, due to a genetic anomaly, is miniature but perfectly proportioned. Turn, please.Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for you?What is this about? We have no money on these premises. Please if you are from some little person terrorist fringe group...Lila?Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?I don't know. Something's missing.So, Mother and Father, how's Godspell going?I'm glad.I don't know.I want our boy back.That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.You better believe they're dirty! And smelly! And messy! And they don't know their forks from their assholes!I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.A little resistance would be nice, damn it.No.Aha!No luck yet, my sweet.Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur.Look at you two. You both disgust me.Shut up! I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.Don't worry, Lila. You can stay. I don't have any interest in you anymore. C'mon, monkey boy.Now!Puff, put the gun down.Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.No.Then Puff shot me. Then I died. That's all I know. That's the end of my story. Do I get to go to heaven now? Or is it... hell? Or... what? I just stay here, is it? I just stay here and tell it again? And after that? Again? And after... Yes. Yes, of course.I don't even know what sorry means anymore. It's odd.
