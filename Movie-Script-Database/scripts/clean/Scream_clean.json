{"Scream": {"SIDNEY": {"raw_line": "Billy? What the...What are you doing here?My dad's in the other room.Can you knock?No you didn't...out at the airport...Got it.Have a good trip.What are you doing here?Now that it's out of your system.Oh it did?So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have little bump- bump.Time to go, stud bucket.You know what my dad will do to you?I appreciate the romantic gesture.Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?Get outa here.What happened?No way.Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.Do they know who did it?They think it's school-related?Sheriff Burke. Dewey.Good.We're fine. Thanks.How do you gut someone?Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.Tell your mom I said thanks.Uh-huh, it's just...you know, the police and reporters...it brings it all back.Thanks, Tatum.It's past seven.I'm not worried.Whatever. Just hurry.Tatum?Hi. Who is this?I have no idea.Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.Because they're all the same. It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl-who can't act-who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. They're ridiculous.That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.So who are you?So where are you?Why would you call me from my front porch?Oh yeah? Well I call your bluff.So where are you?Can you see me right now?What am I doing?Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.FUCK YOU! YOU CRETIN!Oh Billy...Please...God...He's here. He's trying to kill me.....yeah...It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.Did you reach my Dad?At the airport.I don't know. I guess.It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?How's the book?I'll look for it.Any word on my Dad?Just another sleepover at the Riley's.No, nothing's like it used to be.He was there, Tatum.My Dad?It's alright. I'll get it.Hello?NOOOOOO...LEAVEMEALONE!Who are you?I'd rather be around a lot of people, Mama Riley.It's never gonna stop. Is it?Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.And my Dad? Any word on him?Just a sec...I need to talk to someone.I'm not here to fight.I want to talk to you.Off the record. No cameras.Please. You owe me.You owe my mother.And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.Do you still think he's innocent?During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.Have you talked to Cotton?Has his story changed?He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.I saw him leaving wearing it.No, Cotton murdered my mother.No, it was Cotton.I'm sorry I mangled your face.But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now.He promised me he'd be back.This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.I bet he's pissed.Why are they doing this?Jesus, SHIT!No...I don't...it's just...Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.I'm so sorry...please understand.You know that's not true.No...No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.I'm glad to know you're coping so well with life, Billy. But some of us aren't so perfect. Some of us are just trying to hold on.Pathetic.Is someone there?He's here...I saw him...he's here...It was him, Tatum. I know it.Are you serious?I don't know...Yeah, okay...whatever.So you think my mom was a slut too?If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.And you believe it?If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there.You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.Oh, god...Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.Is Billy going to be there tonight?Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?What do you think about when you're having sex?Who?How does that get you in the mood with Stu?No way.What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?TATUM!Deal.Yeah.THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT --How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?Have they found my father?Should I be worried?Billy? Jesus, you scared me.If Tatum sees you--she'll draw blood.It's okay. We need to talk.So...No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.But you're right--enough is enough. I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.But this is life. This isn't a movie.I wanna let go. I do...Why can't I be a Meg Ryan movie?Or even a good porno.You heard me.Yeah...I think so.\"Eight is enough to fill our lives with love...\"Who did you call?When you're arrested-you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.Uh-huh.No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you.BILLYWATCHOUT!!!!DEWEY!NOOOOOOOO!!!!!Help! Please! I'm at Stu Maker's house on Turner Lane. Please, HE'S GONNA KILL ME!Stop. Right there.Don't come any closer.Stay away.Fuck you both.Please! God! Help me!NOOOOOOOOO!!!GOAWAYLEAVEMEALONE!Oh God. Billy!I thought you were...He's out there.NO! Don't believe him.Stu...please...help me...Daddy!Why are you doing this?Fuck you.You're crazy--both of you.You'll never get away with this.Why did you kill my mother?I don't understand...What?Stop it!You sick fucks--you've seen one too many movies.I like that ending.Are you alone in the house?Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.Not this time.This is for my Mom, asshole.And this Billy stud-bucket is for having an incredibly small weenie.Oh Daddy...Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.", "clean_line": "billy dad room knock airport got good trip oh thought sneak window little bump bump time stud bucket know dad appreciate romantic gesture settle pg relationship outa happened way casey becker sits english know think school related sheriff burke dewey good fine thanks gut hey stu use date casey sure stay dad won til sunday tell mom said thanks uh huh know police reporters brings thanks tatum past seven worried hurry tatum hi idea aha randy gave away calling work tatum way like thing voice randy sexy start know watch shit stupid killer stalking big breasted girl act runs stairs going door ridiculous unoriginal disappoint randy porch oh yeah bluff right good try randy tell tatum hurry bye fuck cretin oh billy god trying kill yeah okay supposed pick reach dad airport know guess okay tatum job right gale book ll look word dad sleepover riley like tatum dad alright ll hello noooooo leavemealone lot people mama riley gonna stop somebody called dewey making dad word sec need talk fight want talk record cameras owe owe mother lies bullshit theories think innocent trial stories called liar talked cotton story changed lying wouldn touched raped butchered blood coat saw leaving wearing cotton murdered mother cotton sorry mangled face wasn billy anybody school right promised mistake shouldn bet pissed jesus shit oh god billy tried kill know called night tatum house sorry understand know true billy need time adjusting mom tomorrow year tomorrow parents split thing mom left town coffin glad know coping life billy aren perfect trying hold pathetic saw tatum know know yeah okay think mom slut having affair come cotton couldn prove court created little tabloid twit gale weathers believe wrong cotton right cracking ignore god look place town dreaded sundown oh god thanks dewey luck cast tori spelling billy going tonight billy right touches relax patient tatum know sex stuff guys girlfriend sexually anorexic think having sex mood stu way secret meaning like satanical thing tatum deal yeah fog terror train prom night come jamie lee curtis movies father worried billy jesus scared tatum sees ll draw blood okay need talk billy selfish self absorbed post traumatic stress right wallow grief process forever lying mom think weird analytical psychological bullshit way scared gonna turn like know like bad seed everytime close mom know sense life isn movie wanna let meg ryan movie good porno heard yeah think lives love arrested allowed phone sheriff burke called dad saw uh huh clever way throw track phone wouldn think billywatchout dewey noooooooo help stu maker house turner lane gonna kill stop right come closer stay away fuck god help nooooooooo goawayleavemealone oh god billy thought believe stu help daddy fuck crazy ll away kill mother understand stop sick fucks ve seen movies like ending house fast gonna play little game called guess called police reported sorry motherfucking ass stu motive billy got police way going tell gotta pansy assed mama boy time mom asshole billy stud bucket having incredibly small weenie oh daddy nice meg ryan movie"}, "TATUM": {"raw_line": "Do you believe this shit?Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.Fucking clueless-they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...They don't know. Dewey said this is the worst crime they've ever seen. Even worse than... Well it's bad. They're bringing in the feds. This is big.Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?They didn't ask me if I like to hunt.That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female-BASIC INSTINCT.Or a man's mentality.I thought you dumped her for me.Stu was with me last night.Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?I thought Blockbuster fired you.Randy, you goon-fuck, I'm eating here.No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.Yeah, yeah...are you okay?I'll be there by seven. I promiseLater.Practice ran late. I'm on my way.Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.Bye.What happened? Oh God...Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.Yes, you doofus.I don't know.I'm not talking to you.Hey...Dewey. Can we go now?Goddammit, Dewey!I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go.She's not answering any questions. Just leave us alone, okay?God, I loved it. \"I'll send you a copy.\" BAM! Bitch went down. \"I'll send you a copy.\" BAM! Sid--SuperBitch!Yeah, yeah, yeah...Just like old times, ain't it?Do you really think Billy did it?I knew this guy was too perfect. He was destined to have a flaw.Who is it?Take a message.Hang up, Sid.Your objection is duly noted.Come on, Sid.Nice welt.Yo--let's rock.Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here.Serial killers are smart by definition. They minimize their risk. They plan and pre-calculate everything. Showing up here would be the most lame-brain move he could make.I wouldn't put too much stock in a psycho's promise.I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?Shit, what is he doing here?Just ignore him. You had good reason to think what you did.You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.Stay away from her, Billy.It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.You are not to be alone again. Is that clear? If you pee--I pee.For once, Stu, drop it.This could be good. What do you think, Sid?Come on. Pathos has it's perks.Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.Well...you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out--we've got a long night ahead of us.Come on, let's rock.Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out--we'll be perfectly safe.Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.Two minutes tops.You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.Billy and his penis don't deserve you.With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.Grant Goodeve--the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing \"Eight is enough to fill our lives with love...\" He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. \"Eight is enough to fill our lives with love...\" It's a real turn on.Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, \"Eight is enough...\"Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.Shit.Caterer's here.That's mature.Tits--see.What am I? The beer wench?Shit, Dewey!What is she doing here?So you did--now leave...and take your media muff with you.SHIT!Hey, Shitheads!OH, SHIT PISS!What the...Is that you, Randy? Cute.And what movie is this from? I SPIT ON YOUR GARAGE.Lose the mask. If Sidney sees it, she'll flip.Oh, you wanna play psycho killer?Can I be the helpless victim?Okay, let's see. \"No, please don't kill me, Mr. Ghostface. I want to be in the sequel.\"Cut, Casper. That's a wrap.Randy--will you stop?You little shit.Who are you?NOOOOOOOO.....", "clean_line": "believe shit oh god know casey becker steve forrest killed night killed sid talking splatter movie killed split open end end anymore parents hanging tree insides outside fucking clueless interrogating entire school teachers students staff janitors know dewey said worst crime ve seen worse bad bringing feds big hunt ask like hunt ask like hunt sexist killer easily female basic instinct man mentality thought dumped stu night fuck nut case night thought blockbuster fired randy goon fuck eating prob ll pick practice yeah yeah okay ll seven promiselater practice ran late way worry casey steve bite til way good cause wanna swing blockbuster video thinkin tom cruise right moves know pause right penis bye happened oh god oh god sid sorry late dad town staying yes doofus know talking hey dewey goddammit dewey sorry deputy dewey boy ready answering questions leave okay god loved ll send copy bam bitch went ll send copy bam sid superbitch yeah yeah yeah like old times ain think billy knew guy perfect destined flaw message hang sid objection duly noted come sid nice welt yo let rock relax school serial killers smart definition minimize risk plan pre calculate showing lame brain wouldn stock psycho promise want meet right class okay shit ignore good reason think know accused carving people opportunity skip school stay away billy sick fuck having laugh clear pee pee stu drop good think sid come pathos perks maybe cotton weary telling truth maybe having affair mom sid know rumors dad town business maybe mom unhappy woman prove rumor rumor goes sid talk men hear richard gere gerbil story times start believing sid starting sound like wes carpenter flick freak ve got long night ahead come let rock self righteous little blow ll perfectly safe hey sid think movie gonna play better told stu mouth shut think live everybody american night minutes tops intimacy issues result mother untimely death big deal ll thaw billy penis deserve stu little time stop reflect relax mood think grant goodeve grant goodeve oldest brother remember lived come guitar sing lives love brain dead sisters idiot brother charles charge god love grant hot came day school right puberty years grant goodeve instrumental maturing woman foreplay sing theme song lives love real turn grant wrote song convinced lyrics secret meaning watch sid basket bigger pushing oh sidney guy talk tits til dead minute mention inch weenie watch sense humor knew existed ohh sid let fun tonight dewey ll ruin night shit caterer mature tits beer wench shit dewey leave media muff shit hey shitheads oh shit piss randy cute movie spit garage lose mask sidney sees ll flip oh wanna play psycho killer helpless victim okay let kill mr ghostface want sequel cut casper wrap randy stop little shit noooooooo"}}}
