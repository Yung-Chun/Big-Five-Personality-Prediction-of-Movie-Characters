Like \"Mom, Dad, my black boyfriend is coming up for the weekend\"?Yeah...?Baby, it's fine. My dad would legit vote for Obama a third time he could. Yes, he will want to talk to you about it, and that will be embarrassing, but they're gonna love you. I promise.See you soon.Shut up. I'm very sanitary at work.You ready?Oh, wait.Ready.10 months, so a year basically; longest I've ever been away.You shouldn't have bought them.What?Hi, Rod.I don't even know what that means but yes I promise.It's not too late for us is it?What..? Settle down. You know I'm yours.No!Fuck!Yeah. You?Fuck!!!What are you doing?Chris...?Be careful!Do you see it?I'm from here. The Lake Pontaco area? We're going home.I was driving.My boyfriend shouldn't have to show you his I.D. because he hasn't done anything wrong.No, fuck that!It's bullshit, and you know it.What? I'm not gonna let anyone fuck with my man.We're here.That's the grounds-keeper... I think his name is Walter.Hi!Hi!!!I miss you guys.Chris, these are my parents. Mom, Dad, this is Chris.Can we get inside before you guys start embarrassing me?We hit a deer.I don't know. Down around Lyons road?I think we'll manage, Dad.You think they wish I was still a kid?So...Yay.I told you they'd love you.\"The Crucible.\" I was Abigail.There's a lot you don't know about me.\"The tour?\" Are you serious?Who gives a fuck? Be disrespectful.Mom.Remember when I volunteered at the community center?I know!Now, all you have to do is just quit smoking.Oh God.You guys, normal people don't want strangers fiddling around in their heads.The party tomorrow? I told you.--No. Mom.I hate you.You did.You realize you're coming off like a total douche right now, right?He cornered me and shoved his tongue in my mouth, so yeah.Yeah, great story. Thanks for making it totally uncomfortable.Oh God.Awww.More ramblings from King Awkward.And that's my brother.Hi. Where have you been?Wait, what?Okay. Well then that's good, right?That happened to me too.The nightmares. When I was a kid. She hypnotized me once for stage fright, and I had the craziest nightmares, but it worked...Like... The iced tea thing? Yeah that was weird.Why? Did he say something?Yeah, something about them seems... different.They're here.Extremely.We'll talk later.\"Advantageous?\"Really? `Cause you have yet to say anything that's not a blanket statement about race.Where's your drink?Shut up Jeremy.Yay, baby!Where are you--Hey! You okay?I'm sure it was an honest mistake.Chris...You think my family's housekeeper gives a shit who you're with? That's crazy bae.Look, I get it. This whole thing is stressful.

I just don't get why you're taking it out on George and Walter.Fine.What the Hell was that?A seizure?Yeah seizures don't make people attack people, I'm sorry.Let's go.We're going on a walk.Honestly? That was one of the strangest things I've ever seen in my life.What? Wait, no.You mean with us?It is a big deal. It's my family. I wouldn't even know what to tell them.Yes, it's weird. There are a lot of ways I wish this was going different. I wish my brother wasn't a cock. I wish my parents friends were chill; but just because it's tough, it doesn't mean you run away......I'm late.I should've got my period like last week.I mean, I did change my birth control, so it could just be that, but...So...?Okay... Try any emotional response whatsoever.If you wanna go then go. I'm not going to force you to stay but I'm not leaving.BABY--It wasn't your fault--You were just a kid.Fuck it. Come on. Let's go back home.Yeah. I mean, you're right. This sucks. I'll go back with you. I'll make something up.I love you too.Yeah.What are you doing?Walter can do that.I was just looking for them. I'm such a mess, will you help me?Chris... What's wrong?Oh, I know where they are. In my bag. Duh.His dog is not well. He needs to go to the vet first thing in the MORN--I'm looking.Oh baby... You know I can't give you the keys.It's just a bump. He's fine.He already knew.It doesn't matter any more does it?Hello?Chris?Hi.He left like two days ago.We got in a fight. He got all paranoid and flipped out; He took a cab home. He forgot his phone. Wait... You haven't seen him?Oh my God.What did you say?Uh huh...I don't know. A local one I'm guessing. Maybe uber? Wait, I'm so confused...Rod, just stop.I know why you're calling.Come on. I mean, it's kind of obvious.That there's something between us.We'd all go out drinking...

I didn't know.Yeah, you too.My cousin is epileptic. That wasn't a seizure.Also, this is gonna sound weird, but when he got up in my face like that, I got the feeling like I knew that guy.Let's go back home tonight.I'm just... Something doesn't feel right.No. With this whole situation! I just... I can't explain but I need you to trust me. Let's just go.

I just watched TV.I found out later she had survived the initial hit.She laid there bleeding by the side of the road all night, cold and alone. And that's how she died in the early morning... Cold and alone. And I was watching TV.There was time. If someone was looking for her, there was time. But no one was looking.Yeah... yeah. So, I'm not gonna leave here without you.
