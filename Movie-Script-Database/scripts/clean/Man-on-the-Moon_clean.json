It took me an hour and a half to get here!Thank you very much.Tank you veddy much.No. Caspiar.It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea. It sunk.Mr. Shapiro, it's an honor!!You see, I want to be the biggest star in the world.I'm not a comedian. I have no talent. I'm a song-and-dance man.I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall.See, I don't want easy laughs.I want to thank you, your Holiness. My heart is radiating with pure energy.Yes. TM got me focused. In fact, my manager got me a TV gig! It's just some new show with no budget, but I'm still excited.Um, yes. I haven't fought with them, since I started here.I stopped drinking. I gave up drugs. And I'm meditating three hours a day. It's the center of my life...Oh, wait! I have a question. Is there... is there a secret to being funny?The stewardess let me keep my headphones.Sitcom...?I'm -- Fonzie?George, I hate sitcoms.No.No to the whole thing. None of it sounds good.I told you, I'm not a comedian. And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.I'm not interested. I want to create my own material.I refuse.Okay. Fine, I'll do it. But I have a few terms.Writing down my terms.Those are my terms.He's a Vegas entertainer. I used to do impressions of him.

Now make it roll!And now... in her television debut, the incredible Chubby Rosalie!!It'll be great. The viewer will think their TV is broken. They'll get out of their chair, they'll twist the knobs, they'll hit the TV, but they won't be able to fix it!But it's funny! It's a practical joke. They'll get frustrated!But it's only for thirty seconds!Twenty!Deal.... Yes, it's Andy Kaufman!... Really! ...I got your fan letter... So you like the show? Your letter said I was silly. Did you think I was too silly?... Oh good. I'm glad.Oh.Do you wanna wrestle? It's a good way of breaking the ice. That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.No no no, it's not sex! I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.What do you mean?I've never understood that. It's just... getting dark. But I like you! Hey! Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and GET MARRIED???You know... I was once in your gallery. I was just sitting there and I wanted to touch you. I was kind of depressed because I could see what everyone was like, and I was wondering if, now, maybe I could... touch you.Howdy, I've been watching you ever since I was a little boy... You're the first friend from television I ever had. I always wanted to meet you... and now ...I finally am.Yeah, yeah, in a sec'. That was decaf, right?Yeah, I get that all the time.NO! I'd rather work here, than at ABC. There's no lying in a restaurant. They don't promise you a job as a cashier, then suddenly make you a frycook!The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!Yeah, we can have a garage sale. \"Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!\"Okay... I'll go back. But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka. They're gettin' Tony!Thank you. It's great to be here. We're going to have a very nice time. We'll sing some songs --Uh, we'll play with puppets --Excuse me one moment.Give me the book.They're asking for it.Since you're such a special audience... I'm going to reveal, for the first time ever, the real me.

'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages you've had.'\"Tank you veddy much!!!!\"When I came back from the East last autumn, I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart...\"Chapter Two.\"Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy's running around alone, for on the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby's party. Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness...\"Look! I don't have to tolerate this impoliteness! Forget it -- I'm gonna stop the show. GOODBYE!\"His presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness - it stands out in my memory from Gatsby's other parties that summer...\"\"Tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning - So we beat on, boats against the current borne back ceaselessly into the past.\"Let's get some breakfast.I'm sorry, George...But George, I like to push the boundaries...How long would they let me sleep?I dunno about this... What will my mother think?It's so dirty.Okay.I vill haf both! I vill haf dat fraulein... unt... the vun vith the big strudels!You let me win.Hey. If I give you three-hundred dollars, will you come to LA and help me destroy a TV show?Hi, George! Good to hear from you!Oh, you know the Bay Area! Always foggy!Oh no! Did he get hurt?Oh dear! George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break.I guess I understand. But Ed -- please... let him down gentle.You were brilliant.You were in the moment. You became a producer losing his mind. It was the best improv I've ever seen.Okay. See you next week.This is great! It makes Tony REAL - - three-dimensional! It's very good for his career.Boy, they totally fell for it! I'm only acting crazy!But wasn't it funny?Uh-huh! See, with all these articles, people think they're insiders. They see Tony Clifton, and they say, \"Ah, that's really Andy Kaufman.\" But that spoils it. So NOW, Tony denying being me is the truth! Tony's not me! But maybe he is! The audience will never know... They'll think they're laughin' at me -- but actually I'll be laughin' at them, because they're wrong and I'm right!George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them. But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do. 'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.George, it never was. Didn't you know that?Look at this! An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty! Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...Maybe I'll pick on someone smaller than me...!... And I vow to continue wrestling until I am BEA TEN, in a three- minute match, with my shoulders pinned to the mat!!Yes! BY A WOMAN! I'm doing this because I feel that a woman cannot beat a man in wrestling. Even if they train with weights... it requires a certain mental ability -- And, uh -- I just don't feel they have that...I'm the winner! I've got theGosh, you scored! Look at all those goodies!Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously. It was just part of the show! It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.It's what I'm good at!That means it was a success. I woke up the audience -- like punk rock! (he hands him aThey're having a laugh...That's because they've only seen it once. But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN... They'll catch on!I am the Intergender Wrestling Champion of the World!!!Two, please.Hi...No, I'm sure we'll be fine.Popcorn?I really want one.

I was promised creative control!\"Gee, that bathroom is so colorf--\"I can't, um...I can't play stoned. I feel really stupid.You didn't have to do that!I said I didn't want to do the sketch.DON'T TOUCH ME!Right...During the commercial, the people at ABC asked me to apologize... and to tell you the truth. They wanted me to explain that this whole fighting episode was staged...And... um... I can't do this. I-I can't say it. It's a lie! A cover-up!These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials. Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis...Before we begin this event, I just wanna say a few things to you foul people. This city is filthy! You Southerners live like pigs! So I'm going to teach you some lessons in hygiene... bring you out of your squalor.People, this is a bar of soap. Does it look familiar to you? If you wet it, it'll clean your hands.Don't worry, Mom. I'll make you proud...!I'm fine, Mom, you can calm down.Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing. It didn't hurt at all. It was just a yoga move. I tucked my head in.I'm fine, Mom, you can calm down.Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing. It didn't hurt at all. It was just a yoga move. I tucked my head in.But that's it. I needed you to believe! Our family will be in the newspapers. People will look, and they'll be touched. Because your emotions were honest!Geez, I'm sorry. Maybe I shouldn't have put you through all that... Well, from now on, you'll always know the rule of thumb: Anything that happens to me... IS NOT REAL.Are you sure?But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.It's a rave! Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.George, let's not drop the ball on this. I've made some kind of cosmic career move.I apologize for all the wrestling I've ever done. I'm sorry for all the abuse I've ever given... I was just playing bad guy wrestler. That's not me... it's just a role. But Jerry took it personally.T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!And you're just poor white trash!T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!And you're just poor white trash!This is bad... I only got 28 percent! I'm like McGovern in '72...We were just trying to push the envelope --Jer', it's not your fault. You were terrific. But maybe George is right...We'll stay in touch. Next time I'm in Memphis, I'll stop by the house, and Noreen can make me her double chocolate cake.Maybe I can turn it into a bit. I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged. Demand a recount...Open your eyes... close your eyes... open your eyes... close your eyes... open your eyes... close your eyes...Yes, your Holiness?Why?? I... I attend every year.\"Philosophically\"?Of course I do...Please! You've GOT to let me take the classes! It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!So HELP ME! All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!Go away.Oh, it's open.I don't deserve Haagen Daz. I'm a horrible person.You don't know the real me.You're probably right.Do you wanna move in together?Hey! Our first phone call! Hello?Um... no. Uh, I'm sorta busy right now. Thanks. We'll get together next week.Actually, Budd, you're wrong. I found out today that Taxi's been canceled.I made six bucks. That's good money.... but one ting I do not like is too much traffic. Tonight I had to come on de freeway, and it was so much traffic... It took me an hour and a half to get here!T-take my wife, please take her...H-her cooking... Uh, cooking is so bad, is terrible.Sir, do you have a problem?I, I was asked to do this material -Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --I was very original!The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...I'll come up with something.I have cancer.No, it's true. I have lung cancer.I -- I got some freaky rare kind. It's called large-celled carcinoma.They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.No, NO! Not yet. I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times.George -- it's true.Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.Okay. You're probably right.Dad...?I see them... I see the white cells...It's visualization therapy. He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.Uh, yes... that's true. But he's also ordained in holistic medicine.Of course! But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support! I can't be surrounded by negative energy.Y-yeah? Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead.I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show. The best show anybody's ever seen!No clubs. I wanna reach the TOP! Carnegie Hall...!This is great. The crowd's gonna love this! Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?Well, call SAG. It'd be cool to get one on the show. I want the evening to build and build. It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the \"Hallelujah Chorus\" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!No! NO NO NO! None of that! I want this show to be positive!I don't care about the money. I just want the show to deliver.Tony Clifton.Then he'll borrow it. I know Tony better than you do. Even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off, he'll do it!Abbu daba, abi abbu daba! Abbu daba, abu dabu do!

I'm pleased to announce that we have with us the one surviving cowgirl from that 1931 film, Eleanor \"Cody\" Gould!!Well, it's gettin' even better! 'Cause we found one of the original hobby horses!

There's enough cookies for everyone!!I don't want this to ever end...Okay. Let's try two of those... and one of the pink ones.It's okay, Bob. It wasn't really working. We'll find something better.I can't move my arm.My hair is coming out.I've got an idea for a new TV show for me to star in. It's called \"Uncle Andy's Fun House\" -- it'll be a Saturday morning thing where I can goof off with the kids. You know, puppets, magic tricks...Hey... thanks for always backin' me.Ehhh, you know those guys. If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day. And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.Yeah! He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing! He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!No... this guy's special. He performs miracles.Well... My show is over. I did my best, and I just want to say, until we meet again... please remember: \"In this friendly, friendly world... With each day so full of joy.

What's the story with this guy?He does a hell of an Elvis.Hey, I really enjoyed your set.So I understand you're from Lithuania?Caspiar? I haven't heard of that.Oh. Hm. I'm uh, sorry. Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting. If you ever need representation... we should talk.Caspiar, huh?!People love... comedians.You show a lot of promise... but... my concern is I don't know where to book you. You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself?Yeah, ha-ha. That's funny.You're insane. But -- you might also be brilliant. Alright, Andy... let's do it.Sammy, opening for David Brenner is a fine gig. You'll be on the road... get some exposure...Who?Oh. Sammy, think about it. I gotta go. Hello? George Shapiro here.Er, yes. Speaking.Can I help you with something?Who is this?Look... I don't know what your problem is...Andy, c'mon IN! Thanks for flyin' out here!!That's... terrific! But I got something better. This is BIG... You are getting a once-in-a- lifetime, unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on... a PRIMETIME NETWORK SITCOM!!!!And this is a CLASS ACT! It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows! It takes place in a taxi stand! And you're gonna be the Fonzie!NO! The Fonzie! The crazy breakout character! The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part! ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into -- \"Latka,\" a lovable, goofy mechanic!!!\"No\"? \"No\" to which part??Andy... this is every comedian's dream.B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--You have to do it.LISTEN, you arrogant putz! I've been in this business for twenty years! I know! If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it again!!!!Of course! That's what negotiations are for.Are you makin' fun of me --? This is RIDICULOUS!They're IMPOSSIBLE!! Jesus! I mean -- \"two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton\"??! Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!This Clifton called me up. He's a loon! He HATES you!Mr. Kaufman will only appear in half the episodes. Mr. Kaufman requires an undisturbed 90 minutes of meditation prior to filming. Mr. Kaufman won't rehearse. Mr. Kaufman gets his own network Special.Tony Clifton.I don't know.Andy?Eh, hi, Andy. Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?That's alright. Where...?Alright, I'm here. What do you want?I... I-I don't understand this act.Yeah? Well tell that to the poor schlub who you humiliated!So your name's not Gorsky.This has to stay in the room... but here's the thing: Andy is Tony. And Tony is Andy! They'll deny it up and down, but I swear to God, they're the same person! It's smart business! You'll get two Andy Kaufmans for the price of one!Andy!Andy... THEY SAID YES! They agreed to it all! They thought your terms were a shining example of your \"irreverent wit\" -- and precisely why they want you! You're getting EVERYTHING!No... eh, the Special isn't all like this... just wait... it will be hysterical.No, um... it's part of the snow.Hey! Could you clear this table and bring me a piece of poundcake?Look, I'm sorry. They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like --Tell you what. I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --You signed for five years -- So four years, seven months.What kind of show was this??! There were three-hundred walkouts! The promoter wants a refund!You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry! And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude. If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse! You give 'em Elvis!!And that's great. But do it in LA and New York! There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage! I don't care!I don't know! Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain? The audience... or yourself?I'm worried about Andy. His stress level is affecting his work.Bob, Andy needs to RELAX. See if you can get him away from all this. Take him to Hawaii, or Bali... Find something special. Something nice...I'm not sure how Andy's gonna take this...But that's Tony down there. That's not Andy. Trust me, it's like \"Sybil\" -- Andy's nowhere on the premises!Okay. But we'll have to warn Andy first. I think he's up in San Francisco, doing a concert.Hi, Diane, this is George. I'm trying to reach Andy up in San Francisco. Yeah, I'll wait.Hi, Andy. How's the weather up there?I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.There'll be other shots.Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos. The audiences don't work well for him.Really?! You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.No, I'm serious. If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.Fine, be my guest! Book him.Gene, you misunderstood!! You're not getting BOTH of them! It's physically impossible!Yeah, I KNOW what I said! But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!You're so proud. You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: \"Look, Dad, I got an F!\"\"Funny\"? I dunno. But \"intriguing\"... \"mindboggling\"... perhaps \"headache-inducing\"... sure. Like, that moment, when you both came onstage...So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe. You... and you.But what's the POINT? How will any of this make you the biggest star in the world?But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life. It's obsessive. Nothing's ever on the level anymore.Merv Griffin has received 2000 pieces of hate mail. Andy, Merv Griffin doesn't GET hate mail.No, I'm not gonna take it. If I take it I'll break my back.WRONG! You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!Andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore? Where's that sweet guy who used to do \"Here I come to save the day!\"? Please, enough with the wrestling! You've lost touch with reality!He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion. He'll kill you. First, you piss-off women. Then you piss-off the South. Then you get killed! And I did the bookings.Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback. God, listen to this! \"It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual...\"Thanks for seeing me on such short notice. I... I wanted to talk to you about booking Andy on \"Saturday Night Live.\"We agree completely. Andy has to reconnect with his core audience. So I got him on Letterman tonight. He's gonna apologize to Jerry Lawler, then repent for all his bad guy shenanigans.He's very sincere. And he needs your show...And this wasn't \"Merv.\" This was the hippest audience on television. They've turned on you.You're BLIND! There is no envelope anymore!! It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution -- I don't want you two to ever work together again.Andy! You don't get it! They don't want you back.Andy... it's me. I've got some crummy news. Taxi's been canceled.Hey, what's going on here?Why...? Andy, why...?Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.Excuse me -- but could Andy tell us why we're here???FORGET IT. It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.That's ridiculous. You don't even smoke.Andy... you look me in the eye, and tell me this is true.If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you.Exactly. That's the sort of thing you guys would work out to fuck me up.What was that all about?He's an actor. I remember him in \"The In-Laws.\"You must take a little pleasure in it.Andy, you're surrounded by what you create. You are the KING of negative energy.So how can I help you...?Do you wanna tour the clubs?That's great... but this show's gonna cost a fortune. Even if it sells out, you'll still lose eighty grand.So who's gonna pay for it?You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.Okay, Andy. Will do.You've got good days and bad days.Yeah...I think we can sell that.Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?Really?The Philippines? I dunno...
