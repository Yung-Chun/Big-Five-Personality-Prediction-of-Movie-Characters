{"Margin-Call": {"PETER": {"raw_line": "Yeah.Excuse me?No.I'm not Eric Dale.He's my boss, he's down that hall.Eric, I am very sorry.Jesus Seth.I just wanted to say thank you.Well it is... You were the person around here that I...Yeah. Just a little freaked out.Nah, I need to clean up a few things around here.Nah, I'm fine.I will.Where are you going?I'll call you when I'm done.I am.Come on, come on.Fuck.I can't hear you.Go outside, I can't hear you.Where are you?Are you with Will?Yes.You have to go get him, and get back up here.The office.I'm serious.Our boss just got axed, so technically he is our boss, and yes.Just do it Seth.Will, I am so sorry to call you back but I really think..Look at this.Dale. And he told me he couldn't quite figure it out, then the last thing he says as the doors on the elevator close is `be careful'.So I'm obviously a little curious. So I get into it a bit and I realize that all he was missing was...well it's not good.Go to model four, and it makes more sense.This is basically everything that we have on our books at any given time. But what Eric was trying to do here is work it for levels of volatility that fall outside the limits of our standard VAR model.Well it's a fairly complicated...The volatility boundaries are basically set using historic patterns then stretching them out another 10-15%... roughly.Today.Monday, last Friday, last Wednesday and Monday.Yeah...Projected losses... projected...Yeah.Yeah...I can't find him, they cut off his phone.They turned off everyone's phone who they axed today.No.I tried, it's been turned off.You're going to call his house?It seems pretty fucking right to me.Now?What are you going to do?Fuck me.No.I haven't gotten laid in so long that's not possible at this point.Look at these people.We are in here stressing our fucking heads off that the world as we know it is ending, and they've got no idea what's coming.I've noticed that about you actually.Twenty-Seven.You do know it's a little more complicated than that?Tell him that we haven't found him.What now?Yeah.Seth.I have no idea?I don't know what year?Three quarters of a million bucks?What?More?A million?Fuck you.How do you know that?He just told you that?Do you think that's true.That's fucked up.Does that seem right to you?Jesus.I have no idea.Will?Where are we going?Mainly Mr. Dale's...Yes. Again, derived from Mr. Dale's original model. But yes.Background?I have been with the firm for two years working with Eric that whole time... But I hold a doctorate in engineering, specialist in propulsion, from MIT, with a Bachelors from Penn.Well... in laymen terms my thesis was a study in the way that friction ratios effect steering outcomes in aeronautical use under reduced gravity loads.Um... I was... yes.Well it's all just numbers really, you're just changing what you're adding up... and if I may speak freely the money is considerably more attractive here.1.215 Trillion.No one... besides us here.Yes.How does that happen?What are they talking about?Wow.Careful.A trillion bucks??How would they even do that?What do you do with all that money?Eight hundred.125 left.76,520?Sir.Yes sir.I'm twenty-seven sir.Yes sir.Well, sir. As I guess you may or may not know I work for Mr. Rogers here as an associate in the risk assessment and management office at MBSSorry...Yes... Well as you probably know over the last 36-40 months the firm has begun packaging new MBS products that combine several different traunches of rating classification in one tradable security. This has been very profitable as I imagine you noticed.Well the firm is currently doing a considerable amount of this business every day. The problem, which is I guess why we are here tonight, is that it takes us... the firm... almost a month to layer these products correctly thereby posing a challenge from a risk management standpoint.We have to hold these assets on our books longer than we might ideally like to.But the key factor is these are essentially just mortgages, so that has allowed us to push the leverage considerably beyond what you might be willing, or allowed to do in any other circumstance, thereby pushing the risk profile without raising any red flags.We have pushed it to 1.215 Trillion dollars... at MBS alone.Give or take.Actually not taking place today but what's already taken place over the last two weeks.Sort of.Well, that's where it becomes a projection. But...Well... sir... if those assets were to decrease by just 25 percent, and remain on our books... well... that loss would be greater than the current market capitalization of this company.Well sir, I'm not sure I'd put it that way but let me clarify using your analogy, what this model shows is the music, so to speak, just slowing, if the music were to stop, as you put it, then this model would not be even close to that scenario. It would be considerably worse.Yes.Eric Dale.Would you shut the fuck up.Really?Was?....I think I'm going to go get a coffee, does anyone need anything.I need a little real air.Will, is that alright?If I get out of here for a minute?Thank you.Hi. It's really good to see you.I am.I never left work. Just had to get out for a walk.Yes, of course...How are you? Are you happy? You look happy.Well, I should get back... How's your father?OK. Be safe.Sell.Hello.I don't smoke.It's kinda beautiful out right now.How long have you been here?I think it's beautiful. The whole place. Forty years, that's something... Are you tired?That's not true.Are we all getting fired after today?They're going to fire you?I don't really want to go back in there just yet.I think I know your son.Yeah. Not well... but, he always seemed like a nice person.Have you told him what's about to happen?This whole thing.I guess it's illegal anyway?He's already pretty rich anyway though right? He doesn't need the help.He works with a friend of mine.But you are taller.He's a doctor.Eyes.Yeah... it is.No, never.He was always a pretty miserable guy actually...Have you ever done anything like this before?Oh...Do you really think this is the only... or the... right thing to do?I'm not sure.So this is gonna make a pretty big mess of it, then?Yeah.I know.Well. I guess we should get back.Thank you.", "clean_line": "yeah excuse eric dale boss hall eric sorry jesus seth wanted thank person yeah little freaked nah need clean things nah fine going ll come come fuck hear outside hear yes office boss got axed technically boss yes seth sorry think look dale told couldn figure thing says doors elevator close careful obviously little curious bit realize missing good model makes sense basically books given time eric trying work levels volatility fall outside limits standard var model fairly complicated volatility boundaries basically set historic patterns stretching roughly today monday friday wednesday monday yeah projected losses projected yeah yeah cut phone turned phone axed today tried turned going house pretty fucking right going fuck haven gotten laid long possible point look people stressing fucking heads world know ending ve got idea coming ve noticed actually seven know little complicated tell haven yeah seth idea know year quarters million bucks million fuck know told think true fucked right jesus idea going mainly mr dale yes derived mr dale original model yes background firm years working eric time hold doctorate engineering specialist propulsion mit bachelors penn laymen terms thesis study way friction ratios effect steering outcomes aeronautical use reduced gravity loads um yes numbers changing adding speak freely money considerably attractive trillion yes happen talking wow careful trillion bucks money left sir yes sir seven sir yes sir sir guess know work mr rogers associate risk assessment management office mbssorry yes probably know months firm begun packaging new mbs products combine different traunches rating classification tradable security profitable imagine noticed firm currently considerable business day problem guess tonight takes firm month layer products correctly posing challenge risk management standpoint hold assets books longer ideally like key factor essentially mortgages allowed push leverage considerably willing allowed circumstance pushing risk profile raising red flags pushed trillion dollars mbs actually taking place today taken place weeks sort projection sir assets decrease percent remain books loss greater current market capitalization company sir sure way let clarify analogy model shows music speak slowing music stop model close scenario considerably worse yes eric dale shut fuck think going coffee need need little real air alright minute thank hi good left work walk yes course happy look happy father ok safe sell hello smoke kinda beautiful right long think beautiful place years tired true getting fired today going want think know son yeah like nice person told happen thing guess illegal pretty rich right need help works friend taller doctor eyes yeah pretty miserable guy actually like oh think right thing sure gonna pretty big mess yeah know guess thank"}, "WILL EMERSON": {"raw_line": "Have you guys ever seen this before?Best to just ignore it. Keep your head down and get back to work... and don't watch.Hey.I'm very sorry.For now.It's a total bloodbath.If there was anything I coulda done, you know I woulda done it.Well...Eric...You know me. I'm not gonna say...Look it wasn't anyone. It's just bad luck. Right....?Good luck.Yeah.Eric, they are telling us that everyone has got to get out of here and leave everything behind. While we appreciate your concern, this is not your problem anymore. Alright? Good luck.Well, that was fucking hideous.Really?Got any nicorettes? I'm out of nicorettes, which means I'm gonna kill someone in about 10 minutes... You alright?I'm sorry?Really?Well they're all gone.Thirty-three.They are ready for you.Hey, look who it is, burning the candle at both ends. There aren't anymore cuts planned though, so you can stop kissing my ass, honestly I don't even understand what you guys do.Don't worry about it.Be careful?What is this?What are those levels.Simplify.So what's happening?When?I get it.How huge?Wait, and this is just our floor?Where the fuck is Eric Dale?What?Fucking ruthless. And he's got no other cell?How does he not have his own cellphone?I think I have his home number.Yes... Do we even know if he's right?Hello, Mrs. Dale?... This is Will Emerson calling... I'm fine, thanks. I was wondering if Eric was there?... Yes, we tried but his cell doesn't seem to be working... WILL EMERSON Ok, could you have him call me the moment he gets home, the moment he arrives? Thank you very much.So?I know where he is. You two need to go get him.Yes.I'm calling Sam.Go.I know I'm sorry. I wouldn't have called...I think you need to get down here.Sam...I am well aware of the fucking time, Sam. But you need to see this.Well...I don't think that is a good idea.Hey.Eric Dale...Before he was escorted out of the building by security...I know.So as he was leaving the building he hands a disk to Peter Sullivan...One of Eric's guys....and tells him that he was almost on to something but hasn't been able to figure it out. So he gives him the disk and says give it a try... but the last thing he says as the doors to the elevator close is `be careful'...Yeah.Yes.Well... take a look.Basically the kid dives right into the thing after your little pep talk, nice job by the way, and he seems to have nailed it.The kid figured out what Eric was missing. And......it isn't good.Real ugly.Oh we're beyond close... We broke through five or six days over the last two weeks, but we've managed to stay on the upside of it... for now...Well look what happens here when we get on the wrong side of it.And that wouldn't even be that bad a day for us... historically speaking.I don't know.We shut his phone off.And he hasn't come home yet, I spoke to his wife.Or worse.Out looking for Eric.I don't know. What do I know?Gentlemen?Sam this is Seth Bregman and this is Peter Sullivan.Yes?Peter Sullivan, and Seth Bregman. They work in our risk department.As of today that would be Peter and our junior analyst Seth...?Here. Please just give one to everyone, thanks.I'm afraid so. His wife tells us he hasn't come home yet...and the firm shut off his phone today.He's Sam's boss.He's like forty.Oh it happens all the time. Except to me. Kid's a fucking killer.It ain't pretty.If people suddenly stop buying the shit we're selling....Yeah.Yeah, it is.Did you know the fear most people feel when they stand on the edge like this is not actually a fear that they will fall but instead it's the subconscious fearing that they might jump? ....It's a fear of losing faith.Yeah well, I can get a little dark sometimes.Not today! So it looks like they are gonna have us dump this shit.Yeah, you watch.I'm just saying.You can't... it's impossible. But they'll figure out a way. I've been at this place for ten years and I've seen some things that you wouldn't believe... and when all is said and done... they don't lose money. They don't care if everyone else does, but they won't.Yeah?Yeah... I did.I don't know really. It goes pretty quick. You learn to spend what's in your pocket.Well the tax man takes half of it up front. So now you got what... million and a quarter. Mortgage grabs another 300K, I gave 150 to my parents to live off, so now you got what??I bought a car last year for 150. Probably another 100 eating... 25 on clothes, put 400 away for a rainy day...And what's that?I spent 76,520 dollars on booze, dancers, and whores.Yeah, kinda shocked me, although I was able to write most of it off, as entertainment.Oh, here they go. They are bringing in the cavalry! We better get down there.We were just grabbing a cigarette on the roof and a very spiffy looking helicopter dive-bombed us and then landed.I don't know. Do you want all of us>How'd that go?They are going to do it?Jesus.Seth, someone is going to have to get breakfast. And let's face it, it's you.86 mil. in salary and bonus.Yeah, it's public record.He was worth a billion.Before today.You'll see.Alright?Yeah. Are you kidding? It's not a prison. Do you want me to hold your hand?That was Eric's wife. He's alive, he's home. He doesn't want to talk to us. And he doesn't know she called me.The heights.OK.He just bought it.You are such a prick, and it wasn't.Get out of the fucking car.Appropriate? Get the fuck out of the car.You're probably right... And don't touch any of the fucking buttons.Peter finished that model you were working on.It's created a bit of a shit storm.Do you want to see it... the model?Really?Do you think he's right?Jared Cohen called an emergency meeting of the partners tonight. John Tuld has decided to liquidate our entire position.They want me to get you back there, they are worried about you being out here.I'm just saying.This is serious shit Eric.Well...Look...They'll pay...I'm sorry?No, I didn't.Well...Jesus.Fuck...Yeah.True. Dumping the whole fucking motherload in one day. Fucked up. Well... alright.No problem.I'd guess it's the firm's people.Tuld doesn't want any loose ends.Just come back with them, take the bonus, and you're home tonight by five. Either that or they are going to fight you on everything, the package, the options...Yes it has.The house looks great by the way.And Eric...don't beat yourself up too bad over this shit.Who the fuck knows.I don't know.No.It's not personal, you're just in the wrong place at the wrong time, the young guys are always the first to go. Nothing I say is gonna make you feel any better.The first time I made 36 million dollars for the firm in the last eleven minutes of the trading day.It was a perfect trade...I saw it coming from three days away. I took my time. I was in, I was out...Pish posh...And it was beautiful.I'm not sure, and whatever it is it could be gone tomorrow.I know...but I'm still sorry. At least you'll have some decent cash to walk away with.We'll get it done.I'm trying to figure that out right now.I'm trying to think of every last one of them I can and then I'll make them willing.I'm about to completely fuck guys I've been doing business with for fifteen years so no I'm not exactly ok with it. But look, every last one of them would do the same thing to me in a second...so it is what it is.Everyone else?What are you a socialist?
