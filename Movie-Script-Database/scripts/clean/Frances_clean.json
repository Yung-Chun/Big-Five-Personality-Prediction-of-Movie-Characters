{"Frances": {"FRANCES": {"raw_line": "It wasn't a murder. I think God just died of old age. And when I realized He wasn't any more, it didn't shock me. It seemed natural and right.And yet I began to wonder what the minister meant when he said, 'God, the Father, sees even the smallest sparrow fall. He watches over all his children.' That jumbled it all up for me.But still sometimes I found that God was useful to remember, especially when I lost things that were important. 'Please God, let me find my red hat with the blue trimmings.'It usually worked. God became a superfather that couldn't spank me. But if I wanted a thing badly enough, He arranged it.But if God loved all of His children equally, why did He bother about my red hat and let other people lose their fathers and mothers for always?See you next weekend, Dad.I began to see that He didn't have much to do about hats or people dying or anything. They happened whether He wanted them to or not, and He stayed in Heaven and pretended not to notice.I wondered a little why God was such a useless thing. It seemed a waste of time to have Him. After that He became less and less, until He was... nothingness.I felt rather proud that I had found the truth myself, without help from anyone. It puzzled me that other people hadn't found out, too. God was gone. We had reached past Him. Why couldn't they see it? It still puzzles me.Hi Emma.Bye Emma.Don't touch me.Okay then...I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.No... Actually, you look more like a cop.I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...Whattaya mean?But I'm not. The newspapers're --Yeah. Could look bad for you and Kaminski too, I guess.Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.Harry.Mama...Thanks, Dad.I didn't have much to do with it.Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.Is Kaminski a Communist?He's a socialist, then?It's already started, Dad... with me.And I can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more I tried to explain --Yes, Ma.Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --What can we do, we must live! We shall live, Uncle Vanya...And then we shall rest, we shall rest. We shall hear the angels, we shall see the whole sky all diamonds, we shall see how all earthly evil, all our sufferings, are drowned in the mercy that will fill the whole world. And our life will grow peaceful, tender, sweet as a caress... Poor, dear Uncle Vanya, you are crying... In your life you haven't known what joy was; but wait, Uncle Vanya, wait... We shall rest... We shall rest!But I'll never win that.Really?Thank you.Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?Well? What'd you think?How'd I look?Don't be a rat, Harry.You really think so?I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...Quietly.What happened to him?...So you think I should go.I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...Yeah.Not in the long run, anyway.What?Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free. I thought we might go skinny dipping. For starters.You act like I'm a bomb-thrower, Mama. It's just a trip.Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York.Oh, Mama, don't you understand?I have to do this on my own. You see, I've learned your lesson very well. To do what I think is right and everyone else be damned.It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life.I don't care.What do I do, Dad?Of course.If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.I'm not a Communist.I said all countries are of cultural interest. Besides, Russia has the greatest theatre company in the world.Not much. Ask me about Stanislavski.I love you, Mama. I love you, Dad.Oh, I swim some... play the piano badly... and I read like a fiend: I like history.Look, I...That's me.Did you get the check?... Oh my God, it opened?!, what'd you think?Well, I hope I get bigger parts, they don't come much smaller.No, I'm fine. I just have water in my mouth.No, Mama, I'm not changing my name. They can't actually make you, you know? Most people don't realize that. Oh Dick...No, no, nothing's going on. I love you too, Mama. Give my love to Dad. Bye!Okay, handsome. You win.Kurt!But, Kurt, I...Oh, Kurt!I'm sorry... I'm sorry, let's go back.Harry! Harry-god-damn-York! A real person!Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.What?Oh no...Jesus.But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?You jackass! C'mon, let's get out of here.Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.I know what ability you're interested in.Harry... I met someone.Yeah.These creases... I look like I just came from the laundry! I'm supposed to be hiding out in boxcars, sleeping on floors.Oh, I know that. But it could look more realistic, don't you think?I'll notice.That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.Thank you --Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.But I'm the one up there on the screen.What'd he say?A little strange.It's okay.Well, the truth is the city had nothing to do with it. I was lucky. And what wasn't luck was hard work.Excuse me.Don't I know you?Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.Oh bullshit.Listen, I'm still the same girl that wrote that essay, the same girl who went to Russia, and you people aren't proud to meet me at all.Well, the studio told me not to.Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --Forget it.You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.No, they don't, do they?I don't have what they want, Harry. Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something...Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself.The hell you will, Harry York.Bong... bong... bong...It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.He deserves a show. He missed the movie.I know.A single glass slipper left glittering on the pearly sands. Who was that girl, anyway?'Come and get it,' Harry.Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.My clothes?It's a perfectly good car. It runs.I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!Morning, Eddie.Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.I know. 'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'Sort of.Who?Claire?Fired?...Yes.Showdown.Dick, we need some time apart --Dick, I can't even breathe here...Dick...No?What night?You want his name?My God... I think you're overplaying this a bit...?Goodbye, Dick.Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.Who is she?And what's the title of this seduc... assault?Hi.You wanted to talk?That's me, Clifford.I'm not!But I want to. I'm trying!Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford.I'm not!I'm not!God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!What?Thank you.Oh well. I guess I better leave then.Huh.Thank you very much. I'm glad you liked the play.You can always come see it in London.I wouldn't miss it.Are you an actor?Are you really serious? About acting?Then don't go to Hollywood.I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.No, I don't hate it....Not if I can help it.They'll mend.What?What is this?Why, you... you little bastard!Just one minute...'But how do I know you love me?''How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, \"This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!\" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'How's it sound?You think I got it?Yeah. Yeah, tonight I think I got it.Hello, Harold.Where's Clifford?Oh.What's up?That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.You don't think I'm good enough?Who?A rich actress.But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!What does Clifford say?Does Clifford even know? You didn't tell him, did you? I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?Prick!Harry? Harry, where are you?!I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.Don't tell me what to do, just give me his head on a platter!Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!Harry, I hate being in love. I don't ever want to be in love again. I just hate it!For God's sake... why?Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it.This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.You're right. I'm sorry. Okay, let's go get 'em.So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?God, who's here?Get me a drink.Hi everybody.Connie, can I use the upstairs bathroom?Come in.Hi.Refill my drink, will you, Bob?Putting on my armor.Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?'Forgive'...? For What?You're not kidding. Get me a refill, Bob. I'll be down in a minute.Thank you.You seem like an intelligent young man.Can't you find a more dignified way to make a living?In my eyes, officer.Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?God, you bore me.Don't touch me!Take a look.How the hell do you find me anyway?What's left of my blood.Help yourself. Everyone else has.Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.I took the early rounds.I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?I gotta get outta here. I gotta get out of this town.No, Harry, I can't --You know... when I started acting, you know what I wanted?I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good.Well... to get a crack at something good, you gotta earn it, you gotta climb the ladder first. So you do, you work hard, and all these people behind you are pushing you up, shouting you on. And then one day you realize you are, you're at the top... and there's nothing there. And you look behind you and there's no one below. You're just left there all alone... swaying in the god-damned breeze.Hey, watch it.Get away from me, you foul slime.Who said I was a lady?Ahhh, go eat a toilet seat.What happened? Who're you?I live here.What?God damn it, god damn it... Yes, I'll wait, I'm waiting... I don't believe this. They can't do this to me!Barnes? It's my diary! They stole my fucking diary! Find it, will you? Find it! God damn it, that's my life!I'd say I'm behaving as professionally as anyone else in this town.Terribly, terribly sorry; I overslept. What's the name of this fine entertainment we're all so involved in?Oh yes. \"No Escape.\" That's it. There's no escape.That's it! I'm not taking this any more! I quit!Goodbye!... goodbye!... goodbye!...Shit.What the hell's going on here? Hold on! Hello... Hello?Hey!What...? Help!Don't kill me! Don't kill me!Mama, help me, help me, Mama! Don't let them kill me!You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --GET OUT!I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!Fifteen.Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!Cocksucker.Hey! I'd like to leave a wake-up call for say, ten? Hey! I'll have my bread and water in bed!...Take me the way I am.Who's writing this guy's lines?No, I couldn't get my hands on one.I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...That's fine with me... Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.Are you telling me you didn't have a little rum in your pineapple juice this morning? I can smell it from here, Your Honor.It's the truth! I can smell it from here -- you old hypocrite!Fine!Wait a minute... I haven't got a lawyer...What I want to know is do I have any civil rights?I want to make a phone call...I have a right to make a phone call!They're stealing my civil rights! Help me! I'm being kidnapped! Oh God, help me! Help me!Haven't you ever had a broken heart?Harry!I have a right! I have a right!What?Mama, what's...You're taking me home!Mama!...I want to go home, Mama.Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.It ain't for lack of trying.Why, Doctor! We've only just met!Oh! Are you really?Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.Normal. Average....Did you really say that?This whole thing is a joke!No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you? Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better... and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable... then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, \"Doctor?\"Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away.You didn't say 'Symington says'.So this is the nuthouse...Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!But what is it?You've got to tell me what it is!Why are these all opened?Then why did you bring them?You kill me, Mama.Go on...Yes. It was very good to see her.Not at all. She brought me my fan mail. I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.What?I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...Oh for Christ's...I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.You what?Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!No, I'm warning you! Who do you think you are, God? You bumble around with your folders... ...and your pencils... ...and your god-damn buttons... ...all your badges of authority! But you have no authority! You're nothing! You're a zero!Symington says...Oh my God, I look awful.They're doin' stuff to me, Harry. Can you see it? You feel it? They're putting stuff in my food or something, my water, and they're using it to put thoughts in my head. You understand? They're trying to re- arrange what's in my head, they're trying to drive me crazy! Oh, Harry!I can't stay here anymore, you understand? I can't, I can't. I gotta get home. I gotta get somewhere else, anywhere, okay?Oh good. I love my baths.Of course, Harry.Over the walls!That sure looks like fun... You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?Where are we, mean man?I should've known...This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone......Take advantage of me.I don't think I'd be much good in a war...I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. I wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was just saying my prayers.Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.You know something, Harry?Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.You can't drink.Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!What a man!To quarter-horses.Why are you always leaving me, Harry?You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?What's that?Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.I know. Don't tell anyone.I got your number, Mister Man.Well, who have we here...?It's okay, Mama. It's okay.You leave him out of this!Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.I think I need a little air.Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.Not long.I'll be back.Sure.I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.Yes, Mama.Yes, Mama....So what do you think?I know that, Dad, but --But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?I don't care, Dad. I love you.I'm back, Mama.Wait, Mama, wait. I have something to tell you. I've decided... well... I'm not going to make movies anymore. I thought that's what I wanted, and I went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but I was miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed me. So now... now it's over. I want a different kind of life, something... simple. I want to live someplace quiet and peaceful... in the country maybe, and I'll have dogs and cats -- I feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in... It's going to be okay, Mama, I know it. And I love you.Mama...?Haven't you heard what I said?I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!No!Mama, shut up!You... You'd send me back, wouldn't you? You would.I'm going out!Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.Don't you try and stop me. Don't you dare!If you follow me, Mama, I swear I'll fucking kill you!...Looking for a drink, and the town is deserted, he can't understand it. Finally he finds a bar, goes in -- the place is empty, bartender's closing up. Salesman says, 'Gimme a martini.' Bartender's real nervous, he says, 'No, no, no, I gotta close. Big Otis is coming to town.'Salesman says, 'I don't care. I gotta have a martini.' So the bartender fixes him a martini real fast, grabs his money, and runs out the back. Salesman sits there sipping his martini,... he's got the bar all to himself... Then he hears it. This big roaring in the street.Enormous hands reach in, grab the swinging doors and rip them off their hinges. This huge man stomps in. Picks up a chair and hurls it over the bar, smashing the mirror -- whiskey and glass flying everywhere.He turns to the salesman: 'What the hell're you doing in here!' Salesman says, 'I'm just drinking a martini.' 'Oh yeah?' the guy says. 'Well you better get outa here! Big Otis is coming to town!'Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it....Don't you?No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?...I see.One question. If I'm not myself now, just who do you think I am?What the hell!Come and get it...Who?...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.Please! Take me!I'm grateful... grateful.Harry, please!I love you, Harry. I love you.I realize now that I was a very sick woman.I couldn't relate to others in a normal way.And I was not taking responsibility for my actions. But now, thanks to your treatment, I feel ready to face myself, ready to resume the career which I so single-handedly shattered. I only hope... I hope I can make you all proud of me. Thank you. Thank you so much.No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.Well, I like to try different styles. Sometimes if you're old-fashioned enough, you find you're modern. Right, Mama?No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.Thank you for understanding, Mama.I will, I promise.Oh Harry...Yeah. I don't know.I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.You can't change the things they did to me, Harry. Only I can do that... by myself.Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.I'm sorry.It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...Yes.Wherever they're going, I'm going.Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...Yeah.You know, I've never been able to figure that out.Thank you.Wait. Maybe they'll pick you up.Shit!Dad...? Why don't you stop at a side road and let me out?Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?Daddy!I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it! That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am -- Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to! But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!No! You're not talking now. You listen. You can send me away, Lillian, you can pretend I'm crazy and pretend I'm still your little girl who can't take care of herself, but one thing you can't pretend anymore. You can't pretend I love you because I don't. I can't. Not after what you've done to me. Because you see... I'm still me... I'm trying real hard all this time to be me... and you, 'little sister', you haven't been any help at all. Okay, boys, I'm ready.We shall hear the angels, we shall see the whole sky all diamonds...Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.Thank you, Harry....No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...No.No. Never.Thank you, Ralph.No... no, someone's picking me up.Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?How did I look?Well... you're looking well.I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm a faceless sinner. ...You smell good, Harry. Familiar, you know? I'd ask you to take me home, but...Don't get mad at me, Harry. Please. It's just... Some things happen for the best.It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?Very slow. But we're not going to stop, are we?No, we're not.Goodbye, Harry.

I'm really proud of you, Frances.An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.You wrote it, didn't you?Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.The label's not important, Francie. What's important is: this country's got nine million unemployed and something's gotta be done about it. Besides: left-wing, right-wing, up- wing, down-wing... they don't mean much. All a label is usually is a way to call somebody a dirty name.I know.I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.I'm going back to the hotel.See you next weekend?Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought.Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.You really want to go?And you think it's worth all this?...Then go.Be careful, Francie.What...? Oh. Well, I was pleased, of course. Richard... uh, Dwayne, is a real gentleman.I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.Always. Always.I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and...I love you too, Francie.Francie, you know I can't do that.They'll just catch you again, Francie. Besides, your mother will know.But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.Please, Francie...I'll try to protect you, Francie. I will, I'll talk to her. We'll have a real talk.Are you... are you hungry?", "clean_line": "bye baby amazes lil whip hot hearty meal air thank proud frances essay contest national contest pretty impressive wrote harry york guy lot things ask yeah possible harry york work mr kaminski right lots folks country got square break way things mr kaminski wants change comes new ideas people power nervous wants common man little representation label important francie important country got million unemployed gotta left wing right wing wing wing mean label usually way somebody dirty know right talk daughter beginning understand ve sacrificed order achieve need help lil pay ways lil understand brand patriotism going hotel weekend lillian willing meet halfway thought lil sure thought francie ll learn best stay low walk away want think worth careful francie oh pleased course richard uh dwayne real gentleman know honey mother big plans understand francie wanted got time saw happy papers times different politician know francie hands want look real smart know hold ve got let way things guess know sorry desk room love francie francie know ll catch francie mother know gave word legal guardian hands tied francie ll try protect francie ll talk ll real talk hungry"}, "LILLIAN": {"raw_line": "Frances has not turned her back on the Lord, they're just having a momentary difference of opinion. What child hasn't questioned the Lord's mysteries in order to better understand them? To paraphrase Mr. Voltaire, I may not agree with what she says, but I'll defend to the death her right to say it. Freedom of speech, unlike in the dark countries to the east, still lives in America! And in my home.I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.Bread?When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer?I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?And you... should be proud. You won that contest and made a name for yourself.You're poisoning that child's mind.You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!That's right. I can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure.Good.As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.I'm fine, perfectly fine.Communists?! No daughter of mine is going to Communist Russia!But they're using you!I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or --I never taught you that!Little sister, if you don't wise up soon, it's going to be out of my hands!Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --...You will.The authorities tell me there's no legal way I can stop her, but the way I see it, it's bigger than me or my family... American integrity, that's what's at stake here. They're sending my daughter to the heartland of darkness. . .the dark forces that would overthrow our country. Your country. My country.Help me save my daughter! Save the children of America.Frances, I'm warning you. I'm gonna throw myself beneath the wheels. I'll do it, Frances. Frances!I guess it's no secret that I'm proud. Only twenty-one years old, and look at all she's done. As for her looks, I flatter myself that she gets them from me.And not only has Frances come home a star; she's also brought me this big handsome lug of a son-in-law!Oh, Dwayne! This is like a fairy tale!There she is!Smile, little sister, smile.It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.First things first, little sister. Trust me.Why it's beautiful here! What a view!Good afternoon, Doctor.Oh. Well, I have some background that you should probably know about if you're...I'll be back real soon, little sister. You be a good girl.You'll see, little sister. Everything will be fine. The doctors know best.Not much on hospital corners, are you?You have no right!Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!...and here's the one from Duluth. A war widow with five children. She works in a defense plant and she's very worried about you. I answered her that she shouldn't let worry over you affect her vital work; and that you'd be back on the silver screen in no time.And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.It's your fan mail, little sister.What?Welcome home, little sister.Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?I called Alma because I think we'll need...I swear I didn't know what they were doing to you. I wouldn't have let them...Frances, please don't...Frances, play 'Flow Gently Sweet Afton'.Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.It's just a flow gently sweet Afton day. Life has been so good to me. Why, I have just about everything one could wish... but I still have so many blank pages in my scrapbook.What's wrong?Where are you going?How long will you be?I'll have lunch ready by one.At one. Promise?Say you promise.You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.I don't want you drinking, Frances.Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --Don't... talk crazy.They want you back! Your agent called today! Don't you understand? He's sending the scripts. He wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people! Frances, you can't do this to your fans! Why, they've been praying for you all through this nightmare. You can't turn your back on them now! Look at this fan mail I've been answering!I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!Where are you going?You're not going anywhere!Frances!That's it. You've done it now, little sister.All my life, I've tried to live up to my parents' example. To have the independence of mind and fortitude of spirit that have made this country great. I taught that to Frances: Speak out. Aspire. Make something of yourself, something --Well... yes.No... I mean, yes, Doctor.Well, Alma told me that......Yes.Her married name?...Oh yes.Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.It's a miracle. Just a miracle.Oh, just leave those things for now.You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.Good night, dear.I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.I have!But what --What was I saying? Oh yes, it was the Communists that did it to Frances.They capture the mind by first seducing the heart. I suppose I never taught Frances to close her heart...Pardon? Oh, would you like more lemonade?You know, Ernie, I think we should have Frances' room repainted for when she comes home.

I wanna talk to you.Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh? Hey!I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk.Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?Not me. But other people seem to.Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?That's rich. Hey, if I was a cop, I'd be packing, right? You see a gun? Go on, search me. Pat me down.Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.Yeah, well --Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.Harry.Bye.Sure don't walk like sixteen, neither.Not bad, Farmer. Not half bad.You think I'd miss it?I just wanted to see how you looked.Enh.You looked okay. Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.What?You're not the quiet type, Frances.You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.He retired to Florida... made a killing in vending machines.I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life.Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.You don't know what you want.Frances...Well... don't you think it's up to me to...How ya doin', Farmer?Came to get a tan.Kaminski.Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.They killed him. They threw him out that window.Eight stories.Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done. Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job. I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman. How d'ya like the camouflage?I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other. For old time's sake.Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?Actor?Good. Then it's temporary. All actors are phonies.Serious, huh?Hey that's great, Farmer, just great.Not bad, Farmer....It's one thing to marry the guy, but did you have to sleep with him?Shit. I meant the other way around.Is that why you did it?You're telling me.Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits.Don't start, Farmer.The chauffeur. He's watching.I'm serious, Frances. This is important.Hot damn!Of course it can be done, \"Mr. Jones,\" but it's how you do it. There's a way to pay off L.A. cops and a way to get yourself arrested. First you gotta know who to approach --Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?Calm down, Frances.Frances...I know, Frances... I know.Got any ginger beer?Animal magnetism! No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?Think I'll have a glass.Very tasty.Nice joint. Can you afford it?What for?Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it.Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.I'll bet.So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?Beats me.Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days?You're coming.And?Well, like the man said: \"You can make a fresh start with your last breath.\"Take a walk, pal.Hey!Hi there. How 'bout a walk in the woods?You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.Listen: to the left. Straight through the trees and over the wall to your left. My car is there.Frances! Did you hear what I said?You want crazy? I'll show you crazy!Here.Evening, gorgeous.Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.What?That's right.Whattaya think you're in now?Huh?Who to?Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!I guess.What's that?Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.No. To thoroughbreds.Huh?Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?Well... I'll act like I do until I do.There's just one more thing.Will you marry me?It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.You give up on her?Frances, You're crazy.Anyway... if you need me...You got the wrong guy. Name's Slocum.Look, I'm tellin' you...Frances! Frances!Frances, it's me, Harry?Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...You'll be okay, honey. He's just givin' you something to make you think, so that tomorrow you can tell 'em what they want to hear, okay? Tell 'em you were crazy as a loon and they cured you and you're grateful.Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?I gotta go now.All square, Doc.I love you too, Frances.Where to?This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap.I don't know.Right. Except... time has a way of --I hope so, Frances.I'll be seeing you, kid.Hey.C'mere.
