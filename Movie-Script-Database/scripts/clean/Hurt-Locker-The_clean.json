Do you understand?Sanborn, give your walkie to the translator.What the hell is this guy saying?Hands have to stay behind his head or I will be very happy to shoot him.That's not what I asked you. Now I'm going to shoot if he doesn't understand that he can't move his hands.Sanborn, I need to get this rig off. There's too many wires here to figure it out.Bolt cutters.You've got two minutes to get them and get down here.Don't move.Nope.What is this made out of?Motherfucker. What's our time?Shit. Ok. Let me think.We'd need an arc welder to get this off properly.Let's try the back of it.Go. I got the suit.Take it with you, that's a good pistol.In forty five seconds.I'm sorry.The metal is too thick.Sorry.You alright?Have a hit.Bro, you're not going to die out here.You got time.Hell, I don't know.Yeah. I do. But I don't know why. Do you know why I am the way I am?This traffic is pissing me off.I know where I am but I'm lost.Yeah, okay. You know, they're really short on bomb techs over there.Uh-huh.I know, it's crazy. So how's life at home treating you?We just did, buddy.(trying to settle himOnce upon a time, in a distant kingdom, there were many magic BOXESEvery person had a magic box. But you couldn't tell they were magic boxes on the outside. Like this one.It just looks like a plain old box. Then a new king came along and told all the people, you have to give me all your magic boxes. But the people, instead of giving away their boxes decided to hide them. And they put their boxes in secret places all over the kingdom. They put them in the roads. They put them in cars. They put them in buildings. And the King said, \"Well, how am I going to get my magic boxes now?\" And one of the King's men said, \"We have a special Knight with special armor, and he can find the boxes. And only he.And this Knight gathered up all the boxes, far and wide. And sometimes - - when he wasn't sure if it was a magic box -- he opened them.And the King said to the Knight, you have done a wonderful job. I will grant you one wish. What do you wish?But the Knight didn't know what to say.You see, the thing is, son. One day you'll understand that when you start out like you are now, you love everything. You love your Mommy and your Daddy. You love your bobba. You love your blanket.You even love your little crib, and these dumb toys. But as you get older some of the things you love don't seem special anymore. That bobba is one day just going to look like an ordinary plastic bottle to you. And the older you get, the more this happens and the fewer things you love. And by the time you get to be my age, sometimes you only love one -- or two -- things.With me, I think's it's one.You lost again, Sergeant?Your welcome, m'am.", "clean_line": "yeah open victory
