Hi.They're a Canadian film crew on a location scout for a science fiction movie -- A shift in the room.Star Wars, Star Trek. They need an exotic place to shoot.

A union card for the Canadian Writers Guild with her picture on it.When we're done, you'll know these so well that you'll dream as these people. Mendez nods at them, and gs.

We go to the bazaar today, we fly out tomorrow. Silent assent among the group. Then J Stafford, sitting with his wife, speaks up --I'm asking you to trust me.This one, how much? One day, how much?I promise you that if you will play along today, I will get you out tomorrow.My name is Tony Mendez. Mendez gs back out to the minivan. STAY WITH J and Kathy.Tell me who you are. This recalls attention from the windows.Let's make a movie.If I said you were looking through the wrong end of that viewfinder, would I be right? Lee turns the viewfinder around and looks through it again.She's the production designer. Her job is to take photographs. SHOPKEEPER getting more and more heated in Farsi.Nobody broke. At the door to the residence, Tony can see Pat Taylor, holding Sahar's hand, both looking spooked as the Houseguests come inside.Tomorrow they'll be ready. We start to hear the sound of the evening's call to prayer, amplified over a megaphone, in the distance.Where was your passport issued? Bob Anders dsn't know. ANGLES ON the Houseguests.Where were you born?Toronno like piranha. Canadians don't pronounce the T.If you're held for questioning, they'll bring in somebody who knows that.Last three Canadian prime minsters.Good. Your job on the film.Associate Producer. What's the name of the last film you worked on?Who paid for the movie?What's your middle name? J Stafford is silent. He looks down to consult the paper in front of him, but before he can, Mendez pulls the paper.He's an American spy. Shoot him. A beat on Stafford, frustrated --They'll try to break you by getting you agitated. You need to know your r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9 so well that you don't flinch.My story's the only thing between you and the gun to your head. A beat.

Kathy looks at her husband: he just isn't good at this.Let's go again.What is it?I never would have exposed them if I wasn't authorized to take them out.They will be taken. Probably notWe're responsible for those people.I think the most important thing you can do to be ready for tomorrow is rest.So you know.Somebody is responsible for things when things happen, Jack. I am responsible.Good. And you two leave right now. Ken Taylor nods. Mendez shakes his hand.The first checkpoint is just to look at your passport.Your passports came straight from the Canadians, so you're gonna be fine.The second checkpoint --The second is immigration. You'll hand them these. They say you landed two days ago.These guys are bureaucrats left over from the shah. They can't be bothered to second-guess you.Third checkpoint is the trap.It's manned by Revolutionaries. Most of them were educated in the U.S. or Europe.They know how many \u0098T's are in Toronto.You can call our office. Mendez hands Azizi his card. STUDIO SIX FILMS. Kevin Harkins.

These fuckin' things are like getting measured for your coffin. \u0098He don't look so good. Let's give him an honorary award.'A little experiment. You be me hearing you. The TV we're watching sits in a room with a couple of Golden Globes and pictures of a younger Lester.Six people in the middle of a city of, what, four million -- ON TV, a wild-eyed woman in the crowd makes an ax- falling gesture with her arm repeatedly.-- who chant \u0098Death to America' all the livelong day. You wanna set up a picture in a week. Lie to a whole town of people who lie for a living. Have Double-O-Seven here sneak into a country that wants CIA blood with their breakfast cereal. Duck Iranian intelligence. Then walk the Brady Bunch out of the most watched city in the world...Look, I wanna help you but... In the Army, we did suicide missions that had better odds. So lemme hit it again for the cheap seats:They're getting the ratings, I'll give \u0098em that -- Siegel looks at the TV: at that moment, a HOSTAGE TAKER holding up photos of hostages for CAMERAS in front of him. He takes a beat.We're gonna need a script. A beat of silence. A LOOK from Siegel to Chambers.Nobody makes Westerns anymore.If it's got horses in the title, it's a Western.If I'm doing a fake movie, it's gonna be a fake hit.It's in turnaround. It's dog shit.You're worried about the Ayatollah? Try the WGA.He's only a prick if you catch him on the wrong day.It's always the wrong day. They've arrived at a door with a sign: MAX KLEINHe's the money.-- Till I read the Argo. Look, how \u0098bout we say fifteen thou and close on this?Naah, bullshit me, Max.Thank you. Very respectful.But see -- it worries me, what you said, and I'll tell you why. A couple weeks back I was sitting in Trader Vic's enjoying a Mai Tai when my pal Warren Beatty came to wish me well and we had a little chat. Seems he was attached to star in Zulu Empire -- which was gonna anchor that MGM slate -- but Warren confided in me that the picture's gone over-budget \u0098cause the Zulu extras wanna unionize.They may be cannibals swallowing each other up but they want health and dental, so the movie's kaput -- which means that MGM deal ain't gonna happen and your script ain't worth the buffalo-shit on a nickel. So. Lester takes some documents out of a folder.The way this looks to me -- through the cataracts, I grant you -- is that you can either sign here and take ten thousand for your toilet-paper script -- or you can go fuck yourself. Siegel smiles kindly and holds a pen and the contracts out to Klein. Klein takes them.I took a leak next to him at the Golden Globes.Two daughters.I talk to them once a year, maybe.I was a terrible father.You're divorced?-- press event and reading... No, I promised Variety exclusive on that one... Mendez is making a list with a PUBLICIST.I gotta get back to you, Phil. I can't get my own mother a ticket. I had to tell her it was cancelled.You know what gets more suckers than a sign that says \u0098Brooklyn Bridge For Sale'? \u0098Brooklyn Bridge: Approved Buyers Only.' Philip? You there? Chambers leads us into the main room, leading Tony to a table where JACK KIRBY, 62, comics artist, fusses with large COMIC PANELS of ARGO CONCEPT DRAWINGS spread over a table. Kirby starts to distribute storyboards. Some hold on to them and an ASSISTANT begins putting them up on the board. Mendez looks at them. Impressed. He picks up a drawing of some futuristic-looking vehicles.You're gorgeous. You're in the reading?Keep that fucking space witch away from me.I was married to her. Mendez, now talking to RODD, from VARIETY.The Argo, it's the, y'know, theNo.It means Argo fuck yourself.I made thirty pictures. Half of them the pricks upstairs tried to shut me down. Mendez finishes packing, zips up the bag.My ass is staying right here and running a movie company. Mendez stops zipping as Siegel takes a bottle of Jack and three shot glasses from a drawer.There's always another prick one floor higher up.Bad news, bad news, even when it's good news it's bad news. Christ. (a phone starts\u0098Til the dawn's early light.You wouldn't be me for long. I'mThey can wait. Let's go get a drink.I'm sorry, pally. We're just gonna be in the movie.
