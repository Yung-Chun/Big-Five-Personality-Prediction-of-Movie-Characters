{"Virtuosity": {"PARKER": {"raw_line": "Five years can be a bitch, huh?Where's John?Recital's over, asshole.SHIT!SOMEBODY.. .DO SOMETHING!He...only had a year left on his sentence.Why'd.. .you pull me out?He was a computer program for crissake.Real, my ass. It's an overblown game. Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?I'm getting by.You want to know how I'm doing? Every day, I lose a little bit more of myself. I'm becoming something else, and it scares the hell out of me.But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?Do me a favor \u0097\u0097 keep sending them.OW!It'll never feel right.Sometimes.You actually listen to all those tapes?A little less than yesterday.John died.You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it \u0097\u0097 I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.Go to hell.Enough!I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.It's too early in the morning for me to be cordial. You got any coffee?Only because I got pulled out early.I've seen worse.Jesus Christ. Can you kill it?Not from in here.What happens if I can't catch him?How do you know I won't run?I don't need a baby\u0097sitter.What she's going to do is get in my way.She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.Their weapons missing?Where's my gun?Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive. Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie.Every time I said it, it was. I never really thought I was going to make it.Fine. Never felt better in my life. See, I'm a good liar.Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.I know who would know.Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?What happened when he was 17?Do me one favor \u0097\u0097 if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.Bang...What are you doing?You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.I've been in prison, remember?Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz,For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.Hamlet. What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the son\u0097of-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.Can you tell us what's on the disc?You should see what he's been up to recently.I'll wait out here.Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.Sometimes, I like being part machine.Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?She's beautiful, you know?Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it. Where to?What does that mean?Sounds to me like a well\u0097educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does. Welcome to police work. You better like coffee.I forgot what real coffee tastes like...Don't worry about it, all right?Relax. I know what you meant.Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?I'll meet you there.Stop me.This is my area of expertise.Nothing.Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?You know I am.Tell him.Call me whatever you want, asshole.The only thing I want to hear is your silence.You and me have nothing in common.Enough with your pulse already. Still got your gun?Show me you can use it.Nail the fucker.Any time now...What's the problem?In English, please.It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.Start of what?You like baseball?This is Officer Parker Barnes. Get every able body you can to Dodger Stadium -- J Section.Live execution.Real effective security...Authority still makes me nervous.Both.Everybody get down!GET DOWN!!!Sid's getting away.If you're gonna do it, better do it now.I lost him...That's Grimes...The man who killed my wife...who killed my daughter...who ruined my life used to taunt me with that line...Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!But he's in there. And you knew it, didn't you? Didn't you?!God, you fucking know-it-all! You've known all along and didn'ttell me! Why?! Were you afraid I'd lose it?! Go over the edge?! Huh?! Is that what you were afraid of?! WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME??!!!What the hell's going on?!You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD!DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?Shit!They're going to fry me for it, anyway.You son\u0097of\u0097a\u0097bitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?Then I guess we're even.Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?If you're lying, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.Part of him is.See something?Nice work.Why's that?NOOOOOO!Don't worry, I know. I know.What C-4...was Cox talking about?Where did you plant the C-4?!A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.You mean there's something you haven't asked me?You don't know?Because this pain\u0097in\u0097the\u0097ass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not. And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.What C-4...was Cox talking about?Where did you plant the C-4?!You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?!Don't move, and don't make a sound. Got it?I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it?You are going after Mayor Bennett.Aren't you going to watch with me?What are you talking about?Madison, get me out of here! MADISON!MADISON!!!SOMEBODY HELP!...I think so...You?Lindenmeyer?Sid?Elizabeth Deane, please. Tell her it's Parker Barnes...Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target. How much C-4 is missing?If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates. Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?You son-of\u0097a\u0097bitch, I'm going to kill you.I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.Jesus Christ. I know who the dominant personality is. Lindenmeyer.Where the hell are you going?Listen to me, a bomb is planted somewhere in the Hollywood Bowl! Evacuate everybody!Then put somebody on who does!You've got to stop the concert! A bomb is going to go off!Hey, old buddy, old pal, good to see you again.Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?How's your pulse?Then shoot him already.You won't want to watch. Turn around.Mind if I borrow a couple of your tools for a second?Care to join me?", "clean_line": "years bitch huh john recital asshole shit somebody year left sentence pull program crissake real ass overblown game anybody catch fucking psycho getting want know day lose little bit scares hell months guinea pig ve got survive years months days know cheesy christmas cards family tree yard sending year favor sending ow ll feel right actually listen tapes little yesterday john died therapist hear study face lab rat died yesterday dissected brain analyzed carry genetic predisposition violence program hell survive taking ve got wasting time going play goddam games early morning cordial got coffee got pulled early ve seen worse jesus christ kill happens catch know won run need baby sitter going way wasn deal cox weapons missing gun day years told someday bars guards fights stay alive day years told lie time said thought going fine felt better life good liar worry handle ll kill everybody manson kill cops arrive scene charlie like close personal friends know know learn lindenmeyer file happened favor shoot sure near bang ve studied studying fair think maybe catch write book surprised write ve prison remember like figured better person catch earth create havoc terror war death destruction david berkowitz murder tongue speak miraculous organ hamlet david berkowitz got sid creating far dangerous sum parts getting pumped isn like world series remember bowling ball bag sid carried virtual reality need stop playing computers catch son bitch kills anybody tell disc recently ll wait goddam break going told wasn going like machine tell daughter beautiful know want tell real reason stopped house practice lying awful mean sounds like educated way saying idea stay mobile alert got ve got ready welcome police work better like coffee forgot real coffee tastes like worry right relax know meant start practicing mouth shut ll meet stop area expertise street little different sitting office day isn know tell want asshole thing want hear silence common pulse got gun use nail fucker time problem english fault appreciate trying start like baseball officer parker barnes able body dodger stadium section live execution real effective security authority makes nervous everybody sid getting away gonna better lost grimes man killed wife killed daughter ruined life taunt line grimes come knew god fucking know ve known ttell afraid lose edge huh afraid tell hell going mother fucker going kill grimes dead dead hear shit going fry son bitch let implant head knew entire time good reason shouldn kill right guess sid told killed guards suggested kill pose unacceptable danger public remember goddam thing head lying ll hunt kill told grimes liked obvious nice work noooooo worry know know cox talking plant bomb going tomorrow night idea mean haven asked know pain ass criminal psychology expert helped understand capable better capable stopping sid cox talking plant die tell sound got thought liked audience want going mayor bennett aren going watch talking madison madison madison somebody help think lindenmeyer sid elizabeth deane tell parker barnes trying bomb hell manhunt looking kill transport guards ve confirmed reelection rally target missing demolition team city searching biltmore hotel sid smart know check immediate area device probably got timed position detonates demo teams check subway tunnel water pipe gas pipe sewer pipe goes arena highest law enforcement official country use fucking army need ll authorize death second time today son bitch going kill sorry thought somebody jesus christ know dominant personality lindenmeyer hell going listen bomb planted hollywood bowl evacuate everybody somebody ve got stop concert bomb going hey old buddy old pal good way talk old friend pulse shoot won want watch turn mind borrow couple tools second care join"}, "MADISON": {"raw_line": "The cuffs won't be necessary.I would like the following three things in this order: your mouth shut, his cuffs off, and your ass outside the door. Any questions?No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you. How you feeling today?In other words, par for the course. How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing. If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.That's not true, Parker.What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did. You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it? But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.GET OUT!I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?What's the assignment?Quite an improvement. Hair well above the collar \u0097\u0097standard, L. A. P. D. regulation. What exactly am I going to be doing in the field?This is Parker Barnes six years ago. The most decorated cop in the history of L. A. P. D. Special Investigations Division...Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.What you need is a collar.You remember how to get to Toluca Lake?What are you doing?!It wasn't a lie.You all right?You ready for this?He was re\u0097enacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better \u0097\u0097 to improve upon what was already done.I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him. Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done. The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?You drive well for somebody who hasn't done it in five years.He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers. Stay here.Any sign of Lindenmeyer?Mind if we take a look inside?Do what you've got to do. So will I...You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?Checking my pulse. It's elevated. You enjoy frightening me, don't you?This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.I'm still working on it.Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.I am the demon from the bottomless pit...I am impressed.Who said that?He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.But rather than selecting pieces from each individual, he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones.It's a good bet a couple of the dominant personalities teamed up to overpower the others. The question is, which one of the dominants then finally managed to take control?) He'll let us see the ingredients that went in, but not how the soup turned out after stirring.As a matter of fact, it is.Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory. We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...Think you can get into the program?Not this one, but the next one. The one with the bicycle out front...Give me your wrist.And I'm going to make sure of it. Give me your wrist.Grimes, you better not be the dominant.How did you get your hand out?I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.Thank-you. Her name is Karin.I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're re\u0097adapting quite well. Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.That's only a couple blocks from here.Don't get out of the car.Parker! PARKER! Shit!What the hell's going on?!What did you do to those people?Enjoying yourself?This isn't a game, Parker!That who I think it is?You have nothing in common.I'm doing the best I can!Any sign of Lindenmeyer?Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.Were you able to get into the program?Let us know.Whatever he was doing here was only the start.I don't know, yet. What we do know is his performances are increasing in scale, not decreasing. Whatever it is, he isn't finished...You mind playing that part again?Freeze it there\u0097\u0097You've discovered media, haven't you? You like the attention...the power...You like being a star. What are you going to do next, star? What are you going to...You do like to watch, don't you? If any of you are looking for Daryl Lindenmeyer, that's him...It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences. Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.SLOW DOWN!Parker.. .Parker!You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?Which way?SHIT!What were you shooting at?Parker -\u0097 stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you\u0097\u0097Dammit!Let me help you...Call 9-1-1. Wait for me above ground.Do you have any idea the trauma you put that kid through?!No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was. Get a hold of yourself!What's going on?Parker...I should have told him.I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.Captain, I'm afraid of how smart Sid 6.7 is. But I'm even more afraid of what's he's becoming.Oh, shit!There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.I need your help--I don't set policy. You have the key?Got it.We know you didn't kill those guards.He didn't know about the neural toxin. I did.How did you find out about the toxin?You're not capable of it.I was wrong. And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again.The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...Thanks.I figured you'd show up sooner or later...Find out anything?Can I ask you something?You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go \u0097\u0097 right now. Why are you going to do this?That's why I'm asking.What's wrong with Parker?Show me his physical sensory level.Turn it down!What's wrong?Talk so I can understand.Then fix it.You okay?More or less.My guess is dead.I don't know.Let's get out of here.Give him a break, would you?Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...Hey, Parker...I couldn't tell you.Duck!What do we do now?What should we do with it?", "clean_line": "cuffs won necessary like following things order mouth shut cuffs ass outside door questions like effect tape recorder feeling today words par course feel simulation participated yesterday know saw thing therapist advised putting kind situation true parker going mind killed busboy expression face pulled trigger kind liked thrill going edge taking innocent bystander long got target like wasn wasn making progress instead killing seven people time person involved need know snapped capable understand ms deane wanted assignment improvement hair collar standard regulation exactly going field parker barnes years ago decorated cop history special investigations division letting lunatic like parker barnes loose free world like lighting fuse point saw happened simulator risk public unacceptably dangerous man played judge jury executioner people lives lost control capable need collar remember toluca lake wasn lie right ready enacting charles manson labianca murders wanted charlie better improve ve spent hours interviewing charlie killed leno rosemary labianca ugly way members family butchered sharon tate seeing blood bath television wanted question charlie sid drive somebody hasn years twin brother musical child prodigy died electrical accident age lindenmeyer went emotional shell day night play violin music school country rejected turned computers stay sign lindenmeyer mind look inside ve got ve got problem carrying gun checking pulse elevated enjoy frightening lindenmeyer real piece work working remember years ago music schools computerized teaching tool accidently started frying kids brains government figured better person create psycho psycho demon bottomless pit impressed said mix sid composite lindenmeyer increasingly complex combinations criminal psychological profiles develop ultimate villain selecting pieces individual simply let stronger traits individual cannibalize weaker ones good bet couple dominant personalities teamed overpower question dominants finally managed control ll let ingredients went soup turned stirring matter fact dahmer carried head victims bowling bag week kept locker work candy factory need look sid final profile order understand makes tick think program bicycle wrist going sure wrist grimes better dominant hand prefer keeping professional life separate personal life thank karin told way wanted change clothes sid longer bound programming real world longer limitations behavior like virtual reality sid going evolve know sid going worse know considering ve prison seven hours adapting wait mean way sounded meant dammit hate sounding clinical time meant thought ruin moments analyzing living couple blocks car parker parker shit hell going people enjoying isn game parker think common best sign lindenmeyer know new influences affecting sure able program let know start know know performances increasing scale decreasing isn finished mind playing freeze ve discovered media haven like attention power like star going star going like watch looking daryl lindenmeyer sid performances increasing stars need bigger bigger audiences sid going going involve media slow parker parker flashed badge know way shit shooting parker stop stop shoot dammit let help wait ground idea trauma kid grimes isn sid sid hell lot worse grimes hold going parker told sure guess sid wants think captain afraid smart sid afraid oh shit way parker killed guards way need help set policy key got know kill guards know neural toxin toxin capable wrong wrong tell grimes sid told won mistake rally little obvious target think sid isn grimes sure bridge guy payphone thanks figured sooner later ask ve fulfilled terms pardon stopped sid ve got module free right going asking wrong parker physical sensory level turn wrong talk understand fix okay guess dead know let break lindenmeyer got wanting kill kids musical hey parker couldn tell duck"}}}
