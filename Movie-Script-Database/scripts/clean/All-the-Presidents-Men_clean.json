{"All-the-Presidents-Men": {"WOODWARD": {"raw_line": "No, no trouble, Harry, be right down. Son of a bitch.You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?(to the COUNSEL'SMr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--OK.Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, \"I'm not here,\" Mr. Caddy said.Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord.--you have nothing more to say, I understand that.What I don't understand is how you got here.Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.Well, they never would have been assigned if anyone had known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel. And that could only mean the burglars didn't arrange for their own counsel--they never even made a phone call. So if they didn't ask for you to be here, how did you know to come?Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?Your clients were arrested with a walkie-talkie; they didn't need that to talk among themselves.You're a lawyer and you're here--A Miami social occasion? Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.I have nothing more to say.Nope.Holy shit.Bachinski? What?--hold it-- --OK, go on, go on...That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.I did all right on McCord.The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?You can't believe that.Lotsa hints--Howard Hunt, please.Thanks, anyway--Howard Hunt, please.Thanks, anyway.Listen, forget it.Who's Charles Colson?Who's Colson, Harry?Thanks, Harry. Know anything about Colson?Hello, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washing Post and... Mullen and Company Public Relations? Could you tell me when you expect Mr. Hunt? He is?Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?I'm sorry to bother you, Mr. Bennett, but we're doing some investigating of one of your employees, Howard Hunt.No secret at all.Hello, C.I.A. This is R.W. Woodward, of the Washington Post--get me Personnel--Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post--and--what's that?--you've never heard of me?--I can't help that--you don't believe I'm with the Post?-- what do you want me to do, Madam, shout \"extra--extra\"?Hunt is Colson's man-- --that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel-- --they both went to Brown University-- --Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till '70, and this is on deep background, the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in.According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me. \"I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee.\"Absolutely.I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.Here's the first take--This is all of it, Harry.We have to talk.What the hell were you doing rewriting my story----it was fine the way it was----I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?----and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau----Bradlee went to Harvard----I'm smart enough to know my story was solid----no way--...crap...What is it about my writing that's so rotten?Carl?Fuck you, Carl.It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.I was sure trying.All right, what do we know?--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention. The Times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy Cubans.Right. Nixon didn't get where he got by being dumb-- --listen, that was a Watergate question--Hey?What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.--a spy, you mean?You think they are confidential? I don't know anything about how this town works, I haven't lived here a year yet.July of '71.You do a lot of things when you're on a story. Can you believe we're actually doing this?I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.You asking me to disclose my source?I don't know titles.Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth. Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.To where?This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.I did everything you said, but it all seemed--What's the whole thing about--do you know?Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?The fucking New York Times.--see?----fifteen phone calls--Why didn't we get that?--you do?--with access to records?Whazzis?--this should take only a minute, Mr. Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow- up on the break-in-- --and I was kind of curious about your check.The twenty-five thousand dollar one. The one with your name on it. In Bernard Barker's Florida account. Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--Yes, sir.I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.One sec'--My mistake, sorry.Get me John Mitchell, it's urgent.Can I speak to Martha Mitchell, please.I've met Mrs. Mitchell in Washington, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and tell her--I don't mind waiting.For the paper, no; for us, plenty. I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...?Who's first?You're not a kid anymore.Hi. I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post and I hate to bother you at home--No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.You work there, Miss Abbott.Miss Abbott?We're from the Washington Post and we wanted to ask you some questions about the Committee.This is terrific work, if you like rejection.It's not us, they were scared before we got there. What do we know?Anything you've got.And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?A friend at the Committee told us to contact you--It's safe, try it, you'll see.--you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal.At Yale once, they held an auction. There was this woman and her name was Lulu Landis. Her postcards came up for sale. She had 1400 postcards written to her and I'd never heard of her before but I knew I had to have those cards, I had to know why anyone would get so many messages. I paid sixty-five dollars for them... I got all crazy trying to work it out and first it was just a maze but then I found that her husband killed himself in Dayton, and once I had that, it all began to open, an evangelist had come to Dayton and his horses hit Lulu Landis at the corner of 13th and Vermillion and she was paralyzed. Permanently, and her favorite thing til then had been traveling and all her friends, whenever they went anyplace, they wrote her. Those cards, they were her eyes...Democrats?And I'm a Republican.Sure.When?Nixon.Did he just say what I think he said?Go on, go on--Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.--we will--That happens to people. OK, go on.You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one? Whichever.You want me to be the bastard.To see Mr. Sloan.That's why we wanted to see your husband.We've got another appointment tonight in this area--we'll just stop back later, all right?Think Sloan's back? What's wrong?Mr. Sloan?You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done--Does \"they\" mean the White House?The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?And as treasurer, you could release those funds?We're not sure we've got all the guys who could order you, but we know there were five.--there had to be a White House overseer--Haldeman. Right?One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?Go on.We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it.He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General----no----well, Sloan----I saw him. He verifies.What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see me for?You think she wants us to ease up on the story?--I'm Woodward.I think so.No.It may never come out.Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.I couldn't say.It is.I would, if you really ever wanted to know.Nobody ever had too much.What?--The L.A. Times has a huge interview with Baldwin----just that a lot of reports were sent to CREEP, but he doesn't name who, not here anyway----shit----I know, I know----shit, who do we know?----has he got an ax?--Then he's got an ax. Call him anyway.--I haven't said anything--How high up, which Republicans?--Haldeman I know, who else?The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece--If he self-destructed.Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two. Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that.California, Illinois, Florida, New Hampshire--all the major Democratic primary states. Why does everything you play sound the same?You asking would I have been one of the President's men? I would have been.Ratfucking.I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.Who?--be specific. How high up?The slush fund at CREEP financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so--What?Who are you?Here. Forget your troubles and just be happy.Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?Why didn't they?--who told them not to?Mitchell knew then.Haldeman too?Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after?Talk about Segretti--There were more then.--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--How grand?And Justice and FBI know all this?Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal. God knows it worked.You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--Non denial-denial, Marilyn----his dialing finger must be falling off----he went to her apartment and he told her--Larry Young, a California lawyer----and he says Chapin hired Segretti--He just did.We're inside the White House now.A boy or a girl?Where does this go?--That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control----we're working on the last guy now and we're going all the way--that fifth man was Haldeman.--and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President.--look, when the Watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names?I think that's him.Haldeman.What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?It's nothing personal, though.Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.Maybe we are...--we don't need it now, because tomorrow's story is about the FBI----you never knew Haldeman had control of the slush fund----he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman----Sloan told the Grand Jury--he answered everything they asked him-- that means there's a record somewhere----I'm sure----Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.--We got twenty minutes to deadline----for Chrissakes just tell that--Hmm?Only everything...Hello?Jesus Christ, what time is it?Goddamnit!----I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post--We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?--I'm tired of your chickenshit games-- I don't want hints, I want what you know!We gotta go see Bradlee--I'll fill you in in the car.We can't trust the phones, not anymore. Deep Throat says so.Electronic surveillance.So I guess you could say that we screwed up, but we weren't wrong.Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible.

If it's not washed by three, it'll never by dry for tomorrow.\" And I said, \"Am I supposed to do that?\" and he said, \"Absolutely, it's crucial.\" So I run around and grab all the carbon paper from all the desks and take it to the men's room. I'm standing there washing it and it's splashing all over me and the editor comes in to take a leak, and he says, \"What the fuck do you think you're doing?\" And I said, \"It's 2:30. I'm washing the carbon paper.\" (BERNSTEIN looks atYou had the Mighty Mo and the fries without gravy, right?I never scared anyone before.Facts or theory?We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.I just wish we knew when someone would talk to us, that's all.We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.We understand your problem--We appreciate your position--really.I hate both parties.(surprised, turns toWho'd you vote for?You voted for him.Hi, I'm Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post and--Could I bum one of your cigarettes?----don't bother, I'll get it.Just let me get a match.But I want you to know that I understand why you're afraid--a lot of good people down there at the Committee are afraid. I'm really sorry for what you're being put through.We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse?Please, yes, thank you. (he looks at the--right, right, I've got to go. Why did you lie just then?I was just curious--you don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it?It's obvious you want to talk to someone--well, I'm someone.I'm not even going to put your name down. It's just so I can keep things straight. Start with the money, why don't you?Everything, please.The General Accounting report said there was a 350 thousand cash slush fund in Stans' safe. Did you know about that from the beginning?--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.Which people?Who were they?Sloan knew which five, didn't he?It's awfully hot-- --and you haven't finished telling me about the money--Gordon Liddy, you mean?Think Sloan's being set up as a fall guy for John Mitchell? Sometimes it looks that way.I couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.--we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in.It goes very high--we've got to find out where----she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.How do you want to handle Sloan?He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not.And I'll just shitkick in my usual way.This must be a difficult time for the both of you.Maybe you could put in a good word.Nothing--I just found out that Jeb Magruder from CREEP is a bigger bike freak than I am. I never like it when the other guy's human...We were hoping that maybe now you could. We know why you left the Committee. We know you're not guilty of anything. But we know you know who is----then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written--Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?To cover up?Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, they're obvious----Colson.But they both worked at the White House?Kalmbach--Nixon's personal lawyer.Right.Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?What happens when the baby comes?Look--five men controlled that slush fund as CREEP--three of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach.--yes----no----and we got a guy in Justice--John Mitchell, please.Sir, this is Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post, and I'm sorry to bother you but we're running a story in tomorrow's paper that we thought you should have a chance to comment on.John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that----fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats----according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971----almost a year before he left the Justice Department----to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--Night.What's a real denial?--what?----the lookout in the Motor Inn?-- --he say anything we don't know?----there's nothing new in it--Goddamnit----we gotta top the Times----if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again----I know a lawyer at Justice----almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.--I want you to shut up and listen to me----for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip-- --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.--because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.Segovia begged me for me secret but I said, \"No, Andres, you'll have to try and make it without me.\"--'cause I only know four chords--Donald Segretti?I'm Carl Bernstein. My paper sent me out to see if I couldn't persuade you to go on the record.Mind if I try?According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy.Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?By \"they\" you mean...?By \"they\" you mean the White House, don't you? Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House.When did he hire you?Do you feel much about the things you did?Tell that to Muskie.During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.But you know who did.Chapin did contact you then?On the orders of Haldeman?It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking. Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?What would you have done?Um-hmm. Why?Tell him what you just told me.You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names.You think this was Clawsen's initiation?--if he did it or just said he did it, God knows.We've just been talking to Young----he was going to go into law practice with Segretti.He'll give us a sworn statement.Baldwin told the FBI it was you.--this'll only take one second----Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach----it's gotta be Haldeman--someone from the White House had to be involved----that leaves Haldeman, period.--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--Who?Nah. Maybe.Well, we are trying to ruin his life.What's the matter?I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.--about how all you supposed experts really blew the whole investigation----not about Haldeman----Jesus----and the FBI confirms--what more do you need?--Absolutely--How many fucking sources they think we got?--I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury.Will you confirm that Haldeman was mentioned by Sloan to the Grand Jury?All right--listen--it's against the law if you talk about the Grand Jury, right? But you don't have to say a thing--I'll count to ten--if the story's wrong, hang up before I get there--if it's OK stay on the line till after, got it?Right, right--OK, counting: one, two-- --three, four, five, six-- --seven, eight-- --nine, ten, thank you.Yeah!--what went wrong?--Woodward?What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?You overslept?I finally got through to Sloan--it was all a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the Grand Jury about Haldeman, he was ready to, only nobody on the Grand Jury asked him the goddamn question.", "clean_line": "sure couldn hurt bullshit way months business sixteen got
