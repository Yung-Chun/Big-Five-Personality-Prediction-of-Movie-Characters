{"Moneyball": {"BILLY": {"raw_line": "It's okay, Joe, you can leave it on. It's no big deal.How's Meg?And the boys?That's good. The security guard waits for the baseball to sail through the glass, but it doesn't happen.Night.Yeah...No. That would be, uh--Are you asking me to pick one?I'll be honest, right this minute I'm not thinking about either of those things.They were down two-love and then beat us three in a row. Trust me, the better team won.That sounds good.How about Oakland?Yeah.Yeah.Great. I'm on my way.Is it Boston? You're talking to Boston? What are they offering?What?!You don't know that.I don't know that -- since I don't know what they're offering.Scott? Scott?What did they offer?Just to be clear -- they offered seven and a quarter.As opposed to you said seven and a quarter and they're thinking about it.I'm thinking I don't want to lose Damon, but I don't pay my whole infield seven million dollars.Wait, don't hang up. Don't hang up --What's the difference?It's already through. Billy grabs his phone from the other side.Seven point five?I'll talk to Steve.A small emergency is starting to develop.You look fantastic today.Arn. Billy. We gotta talk about Giambi.We can talk now. We're talking now.Who are you talking to -- the Yankees?Don't hang up.Denise. Billy.I know, I just want to send him flowers.Where would I send them?To Arn.To where he is now, yes.I know. I need a day.One day. I'll fly out tomorrow.Only if my luck stays exactly the same.I'm sorry. Have fun out there.A left-handed reliever if you can.How much longer you think?Nah, it's okay.Arn, I don't wanna lose him.I don't wanna lose him.He did well with his Torah portion I thought.What did they offer?What did the Yankees offer him?What did they offer?No way.I don't pay my whole infield 17 million dollars.For how long?A hundred and twenty million dollars?That's pretty good advice, I should do that.Arn. I get it, he gets it, Jason gets it and you certainly get it. I'll talk to him.Ya think?Hey mazel tov, Arn.Yes.Are you from around here?You a Dodger fan?Here, drink a lot of this.We're losing Damon and Giambi. We can't survive losing Damon and Giambi.I can win without a closer. I can't without power.I have. They want more.I have. They want more than a little more.One.I can't.Fine. He's gone. But I might - for a bit more than last year - be able to keep Damon in - (Steve is shaking hisI can't compete against a hundred and twenty million dollar payroll with a forty million dollar payroll.With Giambi and Damon. We wouldn't have without them. Silence. Then -You can't ask me to be okay with losing. That's too much to ask a professional athlete.It's too much, Steve!Scott. Billy.It's just my phone, it's about to die, but this'll be quick - listen - I'm losing my favorite prospects, but I got you the seven point five.No. No, you won't. I got it for you and we're done. Damon stays in Oakland.Whose number is that - seven point five. Mine?It's yours. So make your call, but don't play me, Scott. We have a deal. I won't be a stalking horse. The word stays in the - dictionary.Sorry, hon. I'm gonna need another day.You've got my suitcase?Okay.I gotta take this.Yeah.No, you didn't.No, I have Johnny for seven-point-five or he's not playing anywhere, because that's the deal --We had a deal.Why am I the ugliest girl at the dance, Scott? Why do I get the feeling I'm always gonna be a quarter million short?No, you played me. And you're playing me now. Congratulations, asshole. You win. Billy hangs up on him.Can he hit?Can he hit?So you're saying he can't hit.That's not what I asked. I asked can he hit.If he's a good hitter, why doesn't he hit good?Right... we put him up against big league competition and suddenly he'll be able to hit.Guys, stop. You're talking like this is business as usual. It's not.Not like this. You're not even looking at the problem.Good. What's the problem?Uh-uh. What's the problem?Uh-uh. What's the problem?Okay, stop. The problem we're trying to solve is that this is an unfair game. There are rich teams, poor teams, 50 feet of crap and then there's us. And now we've been gutted. We're organ donors to the rich. The Red Sox took our kidneys and the Yankees took our heart. And now I'm listening to the same old shit about having a good body and being a tools guy like you're looking for Fabio. Is there another first baseman like Giambi?Then stop looking for one because what we'll surely wind up with is the McNuggets version of Giambi.If we try to play like the Yankees in here, we're not going to be able to play with them out there.No, it's just regular wisdom.Bill James.He thinks differently than anyone in baseball.Don't attack the man, attack the argument.What if we've been wrong this whole time about what ingredients manufacture a win? What if this whole time we thought it was the chicken that made the chicken soup taste good when really it was the onions that made the chicken soup taste good? Onions are a lot cheaper than chicken, you see what I'm saying?We gotta start over. We gotta rethink this thing. We gotta look where others aren't looking.That doesn't mean you're doing it right. Do you watch nature docs? You know what happens to the runt of the litter? He dies. I'm open to any solution, as long as it's not what the other guys are doing.Oh, you mean like Babe Ruth.Really?I should get Rincon?Okay. I'll also come back with Joe DiMaggio and Ty Cobb. And who would like a Faberg\u00e9 egg? Guys, you aren't hearing me -- in what universe can we afford Rincon?And when I come back, I want you to tell me something I don't already know. I want to question everything. We've got to rethink this game. As he exits --And Grady? Nobody cares about a 102 win season.Of course.Well, sir, I'd need to talk it out with my parents, decide if baseball is something I want to do full time. I have a scholarship to play football at Stanford.50 million in additional payroll.Ouch.I should've been a hitter.Supportive. Excited about rebuilding the team.Yeah, how do I afford the rest of the field?I guess you've touched the bottom of the sports industry when your opponent isI need a lefty reliever and I want Ricardo Rincon.Not even a discussion?Why's that? You've got the Venezuelan kid in North Carolina you're bringing up.Well there goes my other idea.You have any outfielders I should be looking at?Yeah.Yeah. Who do you got?Tell me about Garcia.Is he healthy?He'll do. I can give you Guthrie for him if you kick in some cash.Let's make it work, I'll go straight up with you, Garcia for Guthrie, no kicker.Hey.Who are you?What do you do?So what do you do? (pointing at co-Why does Mark listen to you?He just did.Really?Who are you?I don't give a rat's ass about your name.What happened in there?What did you tell Butch?Meaning what?Come on.Where you from Peter?Where did you go to school?I hate Yale.Kid from Yale once blocked a trade I was trying to make. What'd you study?What are you doing in baseball?I'm just curious. Why were you so cagey in there?I know, but I'm the first person in baseball who's ever talked to you this long. Right? Why is Garcia undervalued?Really? Why's that Peter?Oh really? What do you mean by that?Hey Pete, just say it. I'm not about to beat you up. Say what you've always wanted to say to a GM.Keep going, Peter.Peter, don't apologize for what you believe.You read Bill James, Pete?If this approach has been around for so long, why isn't anybody in baseball doing them?It's Billy Beane.I don't care. Would you have drafted me in the first round?After I left you ran me through your computer, right? Would you have drafted me in the first round?Would you have drafted me in the first round?Pack your suitcases.I just bought you from the Cleveland Indians.Good evening.I asked you to do three.To evaluate three available players.And how many did you do?Talk me through the wall. PETER gets up and gives BILLY a tour of the dry erase boards.Let's make sure we're on the same page.We're going to re-think baseball.Look for an inefficiencies in statistics.Exploit the fact that unspectacular runs are just as valuable as 450-foot bombs.Why?We believe there's a river that hasn't been fished.And because players have been overlooked because they don't rise to the standards of traditional baseball thinking, we believe that in this river, there are fish...fish who-- Help me with--Yes. But let me ask you this. If our theory is right--If it's right--It sounds right.If math isn't a theory--I'm gonna punch you in the kidneys if you don't let me finish a sentence.If this is right, why isn't everybody doing it? In fact, why isn't anybody doing it?Make this story less boring as soon as you can.And he was vilified?Nervous?Huh. Interesting.Hey, Art.I got a lot to do.That's Peter.Sure you can.I've got to put a team on the field, then I'll deal with your contract.At the moment, if a ground ball is hit to first base, nobody's going to be there to stop it from rolling.I know. I been there.If you lose the last one of the season nobody gives a shit about the others.It's on me, Art!It was cold.We got Chad Bradford. Right-hander.That's the one. Technically an underhander.Unimpressive.Doesn't have one.Well, he gets people out.Let's move on.Knock me down.None of them. Grady looks like a man who can't take much more.You're still looking to replace him; you're just saying it another way.We can't do it. What we can do is recreate his value to us in the aggregate.Giambi's on-base percentage was .477. Damon's was .324. And Olmeda's - bless his heart - was .291. Add that up and you get - He points to Peter.When I point at you, yes.Divided by three -That's what we're looking for. And that's what we'll find. Three players whose average OBP is -You gotta carry the one.It's right. The others aren't sure what confuses them more - the logic, or the guy who shouldn't be in this room.Yes.That's Peter. And that's all he's going to tell them about Peter.Yes.You can call it Billy Beane bullshit for all I care.So here's who we want. One.Jason's little brother Jeremy.His on-base percentage is all we're looking at now and he gets on base an awful lot for someone who only costs $285,000 a year.David Justice.That's good.Scott Hatteberg.Exactly. Sounds like an Oakland A already. Yes, he's got a little damage in his elbow.We're not interested in him for his arm anymore than we wanted Giambi for his.Yes.I say it's just starting.That's good news for us. He's cheap.He can't hit and he can't field, but what can he do?He can get on base.He gets on base a lot, Rocco. Do I care if it's a walk or a hit?Yeah.You got it.Grady, it's not a discussion.I didn't know God followed baseball.That's okay, Wash. We won't be victimized by what we see anymore.I haven't forgotten that, Wash. One of them is going to have to learn.You're going to have to teach him.Instruct.Scott?It's Billy Beane. Oakland A's.Can we talk?You want to invite me in?I'm outside. I can see you in the window. SCOTT goes to the window and cups his hands against the glass to see outside.Thank you, ma'am.You've played catcher your whole life?How's the elbow?Yeah, don't worry about it. You've thrown your last baseball from behind the plate. I want you at first. SCOTT is so thrown by this that all he can do is stare at BILLY. Then at WASHINGTON, who's shrug tells SCOTT \"This wasn't my idea.\"You're not a catcher anymore. If you were, then mine wouldn't have been the only call you got when your contract expired at midnight.You're welcome.You don't know how to play first base.It's not that hard. Tell him, Wash.Anything worth doing is. Wash is gonna teach you.Jason's gone, Scott.The fans don't run--The fans love me.Hello.Great.--yeah, I have a daughter.This is a contract for you to play baseball with the Oakland A's. A copy's on its way to your agent. Discuss it with your wife and let us know. Thanks for the cookies, ma'am. We see ELIZABETH with tears running down her face...then go back to the living room--Merry Christmas.Hi.She home?Hey Alan.I'm all set, thanks.I don't keep count.Fuck `em.New beginnings. Blue horizons.And Isringhausen.So where is she?You bought her a cell phone?At 12?It's probably a good idea.Let's go shopping.You want one with nylon strings, right?How about this?Let's try it out over here.You got good.That's... that's not the way most 12 year olds play.Who's Alan?Oh, yeah. Mom's Alan. What's wrong with the teacher you have now?Well, you seem to be doing just fine to me. Do you like playing?That's so great. I'm so happy for you. The most important thing in life is to find something you love and do it well. Do you like your teacher?Okay, I'll talk to Mom and Alan. Do you like that guitar?That the one?Let's get it. Let's get it now.Merry Christmas.How'd what go?He can barely hold a baseball. But he's our guy now. Billy sits.Who's that?Yeah.No?I don't listen to anyone, you know that.I'm not joking.That's what we're doing. That's exactly what we're doing.A computer doesn't romanticize the sport. Leave that for the fans.I don't want to hurt you love affair with the game. Just because we've been doing it one way for a hundred and fifty years doesn't mean we've been doing it right. You have any idea how long people thought the sun revolved around the earth? To your eyes it looks like that's what's happening.Yes. Maybe.Yes, and I've thought so my whole life. And now we're gonna see if I'm--I'm not--taking it out on--No, you're not saying anything to me right now.Yes.I'm not gonna fire you, Grady.Well now maybe.Eric. You never even played high school ball, right?Grady's gone. You're the new Head Scout.Don't try to explain things to scouts. They're not programmed to get it. It's just us.I don't know, Graham. Will they listen to your insipid radio show?Well, we didn't pay him for his defense.That's the way, Hatte. Pickin' Machine.None of those broke 85.Chad I have high hopes for. Bradford overthrows his first submarine hand-scraping- the-ground pitch, and the ball sails wide of the catcher. Somebody ducks. Art Howe glances with a long-suffering look to Billy.It just got away from him.He's still got it.It's the first day of week one. There's nothing to judge yet.It wasn't to Giambi? He's the worst first baseman in baseball. What do you think of him, Wash?Work with him Wash.I want to make it work with Hatte, Wash.A rookie first baseman. It's not the same.Lists aren't baseball.Hatteberg will be fine, Art.Hey Chad.You're not, what's up?It's gonna work out well for both of us.Okay.Hey, great to see you. Thanks for coming out. Got a good box? You want a picture? Sure, let me step in there. Great, big smiles now. Big smiles. Know what I like about opening day? Everyone's even. Thank you. You all enjoy the game.Hey, how you guys doing. So you won? That's great. What position are you? How's your fastball? 92? Alright, should we get a pic?Okay, good.I don't watch the games.I don't know what you're miming.This is my team. And they've taken the field. They're world class athletes who are fighting for their lives and I stand with them. Except not literally so I need you to text me what Art does.Yeah. I should have made you a bigger part of the conversation, I should have had you in the scout meetings from the first day, that way you would have understood this better and that was another mistake, I take full responsibility.It doesn't matter what moves I make if you don't play the team the way I need them played.Why wasn't Hatteberg at first?How do you know?He gets on--Still keeps us in the plus column and we only need to be 7 over 500.Yeah, I would have rather seen Chad Bradford in there at the end than Magnante.I don't care about righty/lefty.This is about your contract?I didn't assemble them for you, I assembled them for me.I want you to go on the road with the team.That's why I want you to do it.I don't want to develop personal relationships. I need to trade them, send them down and sometimes cut them. You should learn how to do that by the way.Yeah, let's practice.I'm a player, cut me from the roster.Do it.Man-up, Yale.I'm already sitting.But I am. Keep going.You got that from Bull Durham?Hitting a curve ball is the hardest thing there is to do in baseball but go ahead.You're cutting me?I just bought a house here.Well? That's all you have to say? My kids just started at a new school, they made friends.What the hell are you doing?I'm me. You're talking about kids and schools and you should've been out of the room three minutes ago.That makes me feel so good I'm thinking of burning your house down with you in it. These are professional baseball players. You just do it. \"Peter, I need to let you go. Jack's office'll handle the paperwork.\"Would you rather get one bullet in the head or five in the chest and bleed to death?Go on the road with the team.Yeah.Nope.Hey, honey... I'm glad to see you.Do you want strawberry or vanilla?Don't tell your mother.Interesting. Chocolate sauce?Flight. Yeah, I'd wanna fly. You?Really? Why?Why wouldn't you want people to notice you?Well, I guess you could sneak up on people. Or eavesdrop on their conversations. You could be a spy.What kind of teacher doesn't let you ask questions?Wouldn't you miss your friends?There are always going to be bullies. Try not to let them get to you. But let me know if it's becoming a problem.Yeah...I know, it's terrible. Look, I promise I'll quit in November if you promise not to worry about it.Pinkie swear.Theoretically?Alright. Be good.Anything. Did we talk about the things you want to talk about, did we have fun?Okay.You're doing it right now.You're worrying about me.Do I look like I'm worried?`Cause you're getting on an airplane and those things crash all the time. Will you please stop worrying about your father? You're a kid, I can't have it.Absolutely.Great.I love you. BILLY watches her go off with the attendant, feeling like it was an unsatisfying visit.No no. I'm alright.Steve.You remember Peter.Listen, it's a team of probabilities, and we're gonna need 162 games to tell that tale in a nascent form. It's phase one, we're evolving and we feel confident where we're heading.We're not scared.Because I believe in what we're doing. I believe the numbers. I believe the record doesn't accurately reflect the team and where we're going to be at the end of the season. Peter and I feel very strongly that we need to stick to the game plan, and you can tell your partners to start booking their tickets to the playoffs.With all due respect you asked me to build a team with shoelaces and gum wrappers and we've done it.And it will pay off. Stick with us. Suffer the blows. Listen, life with no money means we're gonna have to suffer a few embarrassments along the way, but we are okay in the end.That'll keep us in the hunt.Nothing Steve.Listen, you hired me to do this job and that's where we're going to be.Well, let's go buy Barry Bonds, then. This is the team we've got and this is the team we'll win with.It's very clear, Steve. If I put myself in your shoes, I'd spend another 20 million on the team.I'm just kidding, Steve, I'm just kidding. We've got the team.162 games Steve.I don't need to hope.We're not gonna lose three at home to the Orioles.I want Dye in right, Justice DH-ing, Pena on the bench, Hatteberg at first and anyone but Magnante first out of the pen.That's right. So that you can play Hatteberg.No, Hatte - as opposed to the guy who gets on base less. Pena getting voted Rookie of the Year and the A's making the playoffs are two entirely different--Not according to, what do you call `em, facts.Listen to me--gets on base more than Pena. 25% more.His fielding doesn't matter.Not only is that number statistically insignificant but it's also subjective. It measures what someone did against what someone else thought they were supposed to do.Hatte, not Pena.That's the point, you think?No, the point - as you said - is to win. I don't like sharing the cellar with Texas, do you?I'm through talking.Getting swept by the Red Sox at home. Having Long lead off the ninth with a triple in a one-run game and not being able to score a runner from first with nobody out, is that fun?Then what the fuck are you having fun for?!Yeah?I missed my exit.No.I'll be honest, if I don't make it in baseball I don't think I'm going to be able to afford much real estate.I know what you meant.You're kind of saying it too.Honey...don't you think you should divorce me now while you're young?Get me Wade.Get him.Get him.Ed. Billy. I need some help on defense and I'm willing to trade Jeremy Giambi for it.(ignoring Peter; toCleaning house.Maybe what?Hang on. (put the call onYes, you do.He'll be fine, Ed.I'm not picking your pocket, you're picking mine. Giambi's name alone is worth more than Mabry.Great.Peter. Rule Number 3: When you get the answer you're looking for - hang up. That's done, and in a minute Pena's going to Detroit.Art can't put him at first if he's playing for the Tigers and I want Hatte in the lineup tonight.What am I missing?Why's that a problem Peter? Beat.He's an all star Dave... (winks at Peter,Why you worrying about my job?Well you should be worrying about yours because if this thing we're doing don't work... neither of us have jobs.In which case I'm a 44 year old guy with a high-school diploma and a daughter who I'd like to be able to put through college one day. You're 25 years old with a degree from Yale and a pretty impressive apprenticeship.What are we talking about then?Dave.Yeah. Okay. You gotta tell Pena to pack.Be a man.No. I'll do that.Mind if I have a seat.You can't start Pena at first tonight, you'll have to start Hatteberg.The line-up card is definitely yours, I'm just saying you can't start Pena at first.I don't think so, he plays for the Detroit Tigers now.Along with German, Hiljus and Jeremy Giambi.Jeremy, come on in.This is Ed Wade's number. You know him?Phillies General Manager. Real nice guy. Give him a call - he's expecting it - say hello - then talk to Futterman about arranging a flight for you.The flight. To Philadelphia. Billy gets up and shakes his hand.It's been a real pleasure, Jeremy. I mean that. You're a great ballplayer and great guy.We're going to miss you.Adkins is gone, too.Art? I can do this all day long.Go out and field some grounders.Everybody, listen up. You may not look like a winning ball team. In fact, you look nothing like a winning ball team. But you are one. So play like one tonight. You'll get further instructions tomorrow.Okay.No more bunts.A bunt is an out. You're paid to avoid outs, not make them.A bunt is for pitchers and weak hitters. You're not a pitcher, Chavvie, so what are you saying?Another thing -- you should see more pitches. We wanna get into their bullpen. Deep into their bullpen. We want to see 100 pitches by the end of the 5th inning. You wanna get your at-bats off their 10th and 11th pitcher.Pete?Triple-A Sacramento's only 80 miles away. And there's no flights. (as they look to75 points.We want to see more pitches.And Byrnsie, you're hackin' at everything. You're all squirrely out there. Wait for your pitch, man. This is a war of attrition. There's no clock on this thing. Wait `em out. Let them make the mistakes. And when your enemy's making mistakes -- don't interrupt them.Yeah, make him work.Billy's fine.Nah, make it Mr. Beane.I'm screwin' with you, Haddie.That's right.No, I pay you to get on first, not get thrown out at second.I don't hit on 17 at the blackjack table, but if I did, the odds would be the same.You just handed them an out. Protect your outs like they're your children. There's no clock on this game. Until the third out, anything can happen. Get on base and let the next guy move you up. Pass the torch, pass the torch. We're like a machine. A run making machine.Hey, Dave. I've been thinking... I want you to --Excuse me?You've never seen a GM who was a player.Is there a problem?You're special?As a matter of fact I'm not paying you 7 million bucks, David. The Yankees are paying half your salary. That's what the New York Yankees think of you.They're paying you three and a half million dollars to play against them.You're almost 37, Dave. Almost as old as me. Let's be honest with each other about what we each want. I want to milk the last ounce of baseball you have left in you, and you want to stay in the show. So let's do that. I'm not paying you to be the player you used to be, I'm paying you to be the player you are now. You're smart, you know what's going on here. I need you to set an example for the younger guys. Take a leadership role.We're cool?All right. Billy starts to leave, but has one last thought for him --You know -- the Yankees are coming to town. If it were me -- I'd want to take that three point five and shove it up their ass. But I'm a competitor.Don't do it, Migs.Thank you.I heard 7 in a row. Billy clicks off the TV and it's very quiet. Billy is scrolling down numbers that show trends and comparisons of all of the A's relief pitching.Can you show me righty-lefty matchups for the division and overall versus Mariners?Okay.Voos.(pointing back downBoth sides. (to Hudson, playingYou guys stop distracting him.Great at bats. Really. Quality.How are ya?I did, and I hope you take it as a show of respect.You look good.Absolutely nothing.But.Magnante's having some head problems.Yeah.He's 37 and he's got three blown saves in two weeks. Everytime he winds up he's thinking he's about to throw the last pitch of his life. So he grips it a little hard.Sure.Yes you do. Yes you absolutely do. No question about it. Except not really.If we have a lead late in the game and they have runners on base, I'd rather not see Magnante out of the bullpen.That's what you should do. Baseball's a game of situations and you should make the decision when the time comes. Except you should make it now.Don't bring Magnante out if we've gotta hold a late lead with runners on. He's 37, he's scared shitless of being the guy who blows this winning streak.I......think the regular amount of myself. Magnante on the other hand, he doesn't think very much of himself at all, and when he tightens up we've got ourselves an adventure. So I'd like to see Chad Bradford out of the pen tonight when we're in, let's say, just to make it easier for you, any situation. Righty/lefty, two outs, no outs, the umpires have decided we're going to finish the game by playing darts, whatever. Bradford's the first guy out of the pen.I don't think so.Just nod a little bit--not too much--like I'm assuring you you didn't just make a calamitous vocational decision.(ignoring the umpire-- still quietly to--yeah there it is. We're the lead story on Sports Center now so let me be brief. First of all, that was an awfully costly fuck-you, wouldn't you say?Second of all, genius, those boos? They're for you. Drink up.Get me this game back.I'm good, Voos. Thanks.Suzanne, get Shapiro on the phone.Yeah, he's lost faith for the season. I think he's gonna dump him.Mark. Billy. Let's be honest. A premiere setup man is not going to get you any closer to the playoffs.He's a luxury you can't afford.By at least one, you mean one? Who is it?I'll call you back.Nothing. (continues to stareSuzanne -- get me Sabean.Sabes. Billy. You like Venafro. I can let you have him for almost nothing.Because I'm amazing.All I want is a couple of bucks and a sweetener. Throw in, say...Anderson.No, you don't. I don't even like him. I don't know why I'm doing this -- but let's do it anyway. Venafro for Michaelson?Anderson. See, I don't even know his name.Think about it and call me back.Get Shapiro back on.You sure about that? I get the impression the market for Rincon is softening. I could be wrong. Call whoever's interested and make sure they're still interested. And call me back.What about the Mets for Venafro?Suzanne -- Steve Phillips! Get me Steve Phillips.Between Bonds, Nen, Kent and Snow, they're never gonna do it.We just need them to cool on Rincon.Steve-O. Billy. I hear you're looking for a left-handed reliever. What do you think of Venafro? I can make it quick and easy for you.No angle.Hang on a second.How old?Twenty-six and in Double-A? Forget it.Furbush?Eckerton.You don't even know who Eckerton is. The phone on Pete's desk rings. Peter answers a second blinking line.No, he's not hurt. He's fine. This is just a situation for us.Tell him to hold. Look. Steve. Here's the deal. I'm being straight with you. I'm getting Rincon. It's a done deal. It's done.No, the Giants want Venafro. And I told them they can have him for Michaelson...-- but I'd rather deal with you. Because you can give me Eckerton and two hundred and twenty-five thousand cash and the Giants can't. Billy's look to Peter says, Doesn't hurt to ask. As they listen to silence on Phillips' side of the call --Of course. Think. But whoever calls me back first gets Venafro. He hangs up. Looks for the blinking light that belongs to his owner.If you could have the power of flight or invisibility, which would you choose?Invisibility or flight?That's what Casey said. Why?Why isn't anybody calling? The phone rings.Great. Lemme talk to my owner. Call you right back.Why would I call Phillips back? Schott. Tell him I'm on the other line.Tell him we need two hundred and twenty- five grand for Rincon.Tell him I'll pay it, but when I sell him next year for twice that, I keep the money.Great! Shit. What are we forgetting?Wait, never mind! (beat, then intoWe gotta let someone go. It's Mags. It's gotta be Mags.Art. Billy. The good news is Ricardo Rincon's heading over to the clubhouse. The bad news is you got to tell Mags he threw his last pitch for the Oakland A's last night.What do you mean, no.We gotta catch Mags before Rincon comes over.-- I need you to stop getting dressed. Magnante isn't sure he heard right, but the silence tells him he did. Eventually -I'm sorry for the crap news. I know it hurts.Thanks. Billy gets up to leave. As he exits, he sees Peter enter with Rincon, standing with his new uniform in his arms, looking like a prison inmate. Oops. Billy joins them.Hey, Ricardo.Hola. Hey, I know this must seem a bit sudden, but the Oakland A's have been trying to get you for a long time. You're gonna love it here. The guys are fun.I don't know if you're gonna pitch tonight. But you're on our team tonight.Right. So... where you from?Well, you're a lot closer to home. Why don't you hang out there for five menudos and we'll get you a uniform and everything. Hey guys, clear the room, huh? Say hi to Ricardo Rincon. As the other players file out and say hello...Tara and me were thinking --Tara and I were thinking about going to Point Reyes to the beach.And I'll work on my grammar.What? Where did you hear that, honey?No, I'm not going to lose my job. Don't go on the internet or watch TV or read the papers or talk to people.Don't worry. You don't believe me? Ask Tara.No, honey. Absolutely not. And even if I did, I'm not going anywhere. I told you not to worry about me. People say a lot of crazy things and they don't always know what they're talking about. It's just gossip. Like gossipers at school.And once you do find out who the authorities are, ignore them at all costs.Everything's fine, honey. I'm not going anywhere. The only way I would lose my job is if someone was to give me a better one. Don't worry about me, okay? Dad knows what he's doing.Pinkie swear.So you're saying if we can get our guys to lay off the first pitch it'll put us in the driver's seat?That's a problem right there. Terrance jogging to first.My whole career I only had eighteen walks.Shut up.Migs, let's make a deal. I'll pay you fifty bucks for every away fastball you hit to opposite field, but you've gotta pay me fifty for every one of those you pull.Hey, T. Did your car get egged?I think I just got an e-mail from the culprit. He said he was tired of paying good money just to watch you jogging around the bases.I don't know, man. Don't worry about it.Man, you're not fooling anyone but yourself out there. You're falling further and further behind. In your mind, what's the problem? Mecir mumbles something.I can't understand you with your hand over your mouth.Right?Yup.Hey, Scottie. What's on your mind?16.5 actually. But as a hitter, you will create 70 runs. 70 runs wins us an awful lot of ball games. I can live with that. Can you live with that?I'm pulling them out of Pete's, actually.Like a greeter at the Gap. A guy steps into your office, chat him up. You're well read, you went to college. Have some fun out there. Relax.Scottie, you deserve to be here.More information. TIME LAPSE PHOTOGRAPHY of all of the changes to the board over the following two weeks.Don't tell me the score, Peter.How you doin', leggy.Sharon?Yeah.Hello?I appreciate that, thanks.No, I'm on my way to Visalia to see our minor league team.No, I don't.I'll talk to you later, sweetheart. I love you.(to himself but toSure.Thank me? Thank you. Whatever you put in those Christmas cookies, keep-- ELIZABETH starts to cry--Whoa. It's okay.It's alright.Well...You never thought that, and that'sYeah he does know you did.No. I just know.Your husband just took a Jason Grimsley two-seam fastball and parked it in the upper deck in left field for a pinch-hit walk-off home run in a record breaking game. Go tell him about it. ELIZABETH looks at him a moment...and then starts cryingNo it's okay now, just go.Gilligan.Aw, man. I spend the season trying to reduce it to numbers and we won on romance. Suddenly it's the Natural with Hatteberg. Scott Hatteberg.She showed up afterwards.I was a big moment for them. You know everyone wrote him off?I know. It was beautiful. But you know... it's not gonna mean a thing.Here's the thing -- we changed the game. We got this year, maybe next, then they're gonna catch on. This is our moment. I want to go the distance. I wanna shove it up the Yankees' ass. Not just the Yankees, but... these guys deserve it.That's right, it's just a record. It gets buried in some book. Come on, tell me who won 19? I don't even know. It's 4th place at the Olympics. Any other team wins the World Series this year... great. We're still in the record books. But if we win, we've changed the game. We've put it on its head and shoved it up their ass. If we don't, they're gonna erase us.I've been scouted since I was 15.I'm not a baseball player.Ready to do this? Pete nods. Billy calls out --Suzanne? Get Schott on.We need to talk about the Red Sox.Yes. But I haven't spoken with him yet.I want your blessing before I do.I know that, Steve, but I'd like to talk to them. I want to see what they have to say.Yes. With your permission.Pete?Well, I think you'll agree this is a great opportunity for him. I can't believe he's not going to make a deal. Peter is frozen. Neither Steve nor Billy are acting like he's even in the room.I haven't asked to get out of my contract, Steve, I just asked if I could talk to them.Then talk to Peter.I think you should think about staying. You're one of the architects of this thing, it belongs as much to you as it does to me.How you doing Pete?Why don't you take the day off.Yes it is. It is.No.I don't know.I think that's James Taylor and I'm certain those aren't the words.We've got free soda.No I meant something that women wear with, you know, a decorative --John, no disrespect, I just lost in five for the second year in a row -- give her a bowling ball for all I care.Yes he is.You're the Red Sox, and I think I can help you.I think I can do something about the Curse of the Bambino. I heard you hired Bill James.Because baseball hates him.That must be nice. I was grateful to get your call.Yeah.What's this?Jesus. What the hell --What the hell was that?Impressive.Why would I ever do that?Oh, what is that, your GM voice? You can't have him.You already have my job. What else do you want from me?Why did you take it?It doesn't matter.It was fine.It doesn't matter.So why am I doing this?I'm not?The offer says that. The money itself is redundant.I haven't decided.Look at this place. What a dump.No Pete, we lost.I'm not even over last year yet. I don't get over it.I really can't look at video right now.Who is it?Please tell me he's safe at second.What is that?Why's he laughing? I'm gonna fire that guy, why the hell is he --How can anybody not be romantic about baseball?I know it was a metaphor.The Island of Misfit Toys.

I've given you a lot of flexibility. When are we gonna start to see a change in these results? Schott sits back at his desk.Give me a date, give me a time frame.7 within 500. By July.

This is no time to push the panic button. This is the way we've been doing it for 150 years. Let us do our job.That's fortune cookie wisdom.Okay, Billy. Clearly you have something on your mind.Bill James was a night security guard at the Stokely Van Camp Pork and Beans Factory.He's not in baseball. He's in pork and beans.With all due respect, we've been doing this for a long time.Billy, I've seen Garcia. He's got a bad body. It's not a pretty sight.He's not just big, but kind of doughy. A fleshy kind of body.How did it go in Cleveland?Let's get after our relief pitching problem.Submariner?What's his velocity?Does he have a good breaking ball?Why do you like this guy?He's down there. He's down there real low, too.Well, we, I think, have fared better. We have some ideas for what to do about Giambi.We trade power for speed. A rabbit for a gorilla - We go for an overachiever. A big heart in the last year his contract. Tend to play hard. We usually get a pretty good year out of them. Make up for some of the offense we lost. Or the other option. Just a thought.

Which do you want to talk about first?The -Billy?Who's that?I don't know how to say this delicately - but does - Peter - need to be here?This guy could start the year with an agent and end up with a parole officer for Christ's sake.Ten years ago he was a big name. He's going to really help our season tickets at the beginning of the year. But by June he's not going to be hitting his weight.And why do we want to be the ones to bail Justice out of his contract?I got 37 free agents who are better than those guys.Some damage? He can't throw.Wait, you're talkin' about Hatteberg at first?Let me understand this. At first base you want a guy who's been cut from half of the minor league teams in the country due to irreparable nerve damage?You want to replace Jason Giambi with not one but three defective players?Billy, we've all been busting our asses the last six and a half weeks to make this a better ball--Can we talk a minute?Your boy and I had a talk while you were in Tacoma. I didn't like much of what I heard.No. You got a kid in there with a Yale economics degree and a scout out here with 29 years baseball experience and you're listening to the wrong one.This isn't a joke.This isn't how you run a ball club, with a computer. You know that. You're a baseball man. There are intangibles that only a scout can see in a player that you're not going to pick up with just numbers, with someone who doesn't play the game, who knows nothing about the game but how to feed numbers into a computer.If this is what baseball is, if it's not Kirk Gibson going up to the plate on two bad legs because the manager felt in his heart that he had one swing left in that body... a computer wouldn't do that. They would have had him sitting up in the stands.Well, romance and the fans, it's called a love affair with the game and it's been going on for one hundred and fifty years.You're saying everybody's been wrong? Everybody? Beat.Are you saying everybody's been wrong?--we're gonna see if you're right?! This is about you and your shit? Some scouts from 20 years ago called it wrong, okay? They thought you were a ballplayer and you weren't. As you know, it happens.

Oh Bruce? I told him I like Garcia.He's undervalued. You were smart to go after him.Maryland.Yale.Why?Economics.I love baseball.I work for a different team.Okay, truthfully, it might not be so easy to explain.We might not see the game the same way.You've spent your life in baseball and I don't have a very traditional view of the game.Baseball thinking is medieval. It's stuck in the Dark Ages. I have a more scientific view of the game.There is an epidemic failure within the game to understand what's really happening. And it leads people who run major league teams to misjudge their players and mismanage their teams. They're still asking the wrong questions. People who run baseball teams still think in terms of buying players. Sorry to say that.The goal shouldn't be to buy players, what you want to buy is wins. To buy wins, you buy runs. You're trying to replace Johnny Damon. The Red Sox look at Johnny Damon and they see a star worth seven point five million a year. When I look at Johnny Damon, I see an imperfect understanding of where runs come from.He's got a good glove. He's a decent leadoff hitter. He steals bases. But he's not worth the seven point five million Boston is paying him. You're lucky to have him off your payroll, it opens all kinds of interesting possibilities.Yes. These ideas and this approach to the game aren't all new. In fact, some of them have been around for two decades.That's a much more difficult question than how to win baseball games. Once you begin to pull at that string, your understanding of the world might begin to unravel.Hello?What time is it?What?You were a good baseball player.Why?Good evening.Yes.Yeah.51, I don't know why I lied just then.This is the American League West. This year we're going to need to win between 97 and 101 games to make the post season. Here's the number of runs we'll need to score in order to win those games and here's the number of runs we can allow.Okay.Yes.Examine the ways that runs are scored and prevented.Unspectacular runs are more valuable.We know it for sure.Forget the fish. In this room is every available player at every level of professional baseball, and somewhere in that group are 25 players that everyone has else has thrown out.An island of misfit toys. In this room is a championship team that we can afford.Math isn't a theory.It's right.It is right.It isn't.Sorry.Somebody once said, \"It's not what you don't know that worries me it's what you know for sure that's got me scared.\" In the mid-19th Century in Budapest there was an incredibly high instance of mothers dying shortly after childbirth from a disease called puerperal fever.A doctor named Semmelweiss showed that if the attending physicians and nurses sterilized their hands before delivery, the mortality rate dropped to 1%.He was institutionalized. For suggesting that washing your hands before putting them inside someone else's body was a good idea. High functioning people can live under the spell of an inexplicable mental lapse when they think as a group. Why isn't anybody else doing it? Because they don't think guys who look like you are what win baseball games. They know it for sure.No??You want me to speak?Ten-ninety-two.Three-sixty-four.Three-sixty-four.He gets on base.You do not.How'd it go?Hatteberg.That is Kevin Youkilis. This is the guy we want more than anyone else in the world.He can't run, throw or field. But he walks more than anyone in baseball except Barry Bonds. Take out intentional walks and it's more than Bonds. He's the Greek God of Walks.I tried to get Shapiro to draft him last June. He said he waddled like a duck. Boston took him. Boston won't let him go yet. They're going to wait and see.You all right, Billy?Why?Is this a joke?I'm miming \"You don't watch the games?!\"You don't go on the road with the team.Why don't you?The only way I'd have to cut a player is if you oh come on!No.No.This is stupid.Fine. Billy, would you have a seat for a moment, I need to talk to you.I was pretending you weren't sitting.This is the hardest thing there is to do in baseball.Yeah.You've been a huge part of this team but decisions have to be made that are best for the team, I'm sure you can understand that.I'm really sorry.That's--I'd leave them in school, you don't want to take them out in the middleAre you you or the player?Shouldn't I tell them that they'll always be a part of the A's family?That's it?Those are my only choices?He doesn't like to mingle with the players.Billy likes to keep the money on the field.It's not a big enough sample yet. I want to wait until we play more games.Theoretically, when we've played more games the numbers will become moreOur goal and our expectation by the All Star break is to be within seven games of first place.And that would be this working exceptionally well.Cruz -- .283, .347, .476. Stevens -- .244, .349, .560. Miner -- .272, .349, .499. Hanson -- .280, .363, .450. Baretta -- .273, .354, .497. Durazo -- .292, .395, .621. What do you think?You okay?Why.Why.No, you -What are you doing? Jeremy's doingI don't know.Runs hot and cold, Billy. Impossible to know what we're going to get. He's a crap shoot. He's exactly the kind of player we're not looking for.I think he was going to say something else.I don't think you want to do that.Maybe you should think about this. You're upset and this is - this -It's just a very hard move to explain. People are going to think you've lost your mind.Don't make an emotional decision Billy.Probably an all star.(trying to slow itThat's probably true.It's close Billy but theoretically Hatteberg.That was thoughtful.You want me to tell Pena he's been traded?What about Jeremy? Am I telling him, too.Hey, Carlos.Can I get a moment with you?Okay, maybe we can talk over here.Have a seat. They sit.So, um, Carlos, you've been traded to the Tigers. This is the number of Jay Palmer, their travel secretary. He's expecting your call. He'll help you arrange travel to Detroit.Yeah.I'm not looking at anything.At least once every ten at bats.Every at bat is like a hand of blackjack. Every card that's dealt, your odds completely change. For instance, every first pitch strike, your batting average goes down about 75 points.75 points. Every first pitch ball, it goes up about the same amount. So you gotta lay off the first pitch.First pitch period. When you swing at the first pitch you're batting .140.Every starter, we want to see 100 pitches by the 5th inning.Yeah. I mean, Hatteberg drained 38 pitches.Basically, these are all your at bats. This is you versus righties, you versus lefties... and then, of course, all your count knowledge, okay? In an 0-0 count you're batting .290. In an 0-1 you average .238. In a 0-2, .159. When you're 1-0, you're batting .324. Understand what I'm saying?I know, it's a lot of math. When your first pitch is a strike, your batting average goes down about 70 points.When it's a ball, it goes up about 30. If you draw a ball on your first pitch, you're unstoppable. If you strike on the first pitch, you might as well be jumping off cliff. I'm trying to get you to lay off the first pitch.And that's the way you've been trained. But it's a habit we'd like to break you from. We're trying to design the game to your strengths. This has nothing to do with you being a great hitter -- you're a great hitter. We just want to get you on base.I'm not worried about you crushing the ball out of the park. I just want you to lay off anything that will result in a strike.Absolutely. The video room is open to you any time, I'm always available.-- But seriously. Make him use up all his bullets.You've actually gotten caught 6 out of 17 tries this season.Did you hear that?Are you thinking Rincon?Hardcore.What do you think we can get for Magnante?Two-seventy-five.Us.Anderson.Anderson.You just offered him to the Giants.Totally agree.Bennett maybe?Twenty-six.Duncan? No. Cerda? No. Furbush?Eckerton? Eckerton. Eckerton, that's the guy. Billy punches the phone off hold.Hello?Oh, hi.It's Steve.Steve Schott.Yes, I understand it's impolite to keep you holding.He hung up.What?You'd have total access. Besides, everyone else would choose flight.Phillips or Schott?Right.Mr. Schott, it's Peter Brand. Sorry I left you on hold. Billy asked me to call you back. He's on another line.Billy says he needs two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars for Ricardo Rincon. Please?Billy says he'll pay for Rincon himself, sell him next year, and keep the profit.Okay. Thank you.I call not it.It's not the phone's fault. Suzanne, we're gonna need a new speakerphone.Muy divertido.This is a chart of what you should and shouldn't be swinging at. These circles represent different pitches. Red is hit, blue is out, yellow's missed or foul, green is chased, white taken. This is you versus Conway. What do you see?The red is where most hits happen. That's where you want to be swinging. You don't want to be swinging at the junk at the top of the strike zone. We'd rather take those strikes, `cause you're not going to hit `em out of the park. And you're good about that, patient.Right now you're averaging about 4 pitches per at-bat.Yeah, and that's great. One of the reasons why we love you. You're draining a pitcher's pitches. Now, guys like Bonds and Jason Giambi average a little over 5. That's top tier. Does this chart make sense to you?Every game. Your instincts are in the right place. This isn't something they teach you in little league. This is something fundamental we're looking for -- how to wear out a pitcher's arm. If you're about to face Conway and wondering what you should and shouldn't swing at, come in here and watch how you're tending. You can click on any one of these pitches and watch it happen. Pretty great, right?Everybody thinks the first pitch is what's most important, but it's not. It's the first two out of three pitches that matter the most.The difference between 1-2 and 2-1 is the difference between a scrub and an All Star.Any sort of extra discipline in the first three pitches will help us.Hatteberg once had 18 walks in 30 at bats.Actually... 11.Congratulations.Well, I didn't see that coming.Okay... okay...I'm a little overwhelmed right now. I think I need to process what's happening.Heads up!Sorry.I don't know. Sorry.You're giving me Youkilis, Billy.Come on Billy, Schott's going to want something in exchange for letting you out of your contract and I want Youkilis.And Cash. And a player to be named later.I don't want your job.You didn't leave me much choice.Did he make you a good offer?What was it?He offered to make you the highest paid GM in pro sports.I don't know. I've never heard you say you did.You're not doing it for the money.You're doing it for what the money says. It says what it says to any player who gets big money: that they're worth it.So you're not going to Boston?It's all over the news that it's a done deal.I think you've already won, Billy.You haven't given yourself time to get over it, it's only been three days.No, come with me.", "clean_line": "hi peter brand special assistant mark shapiro player evaluation right actually rarely think listening

Whatever it is, Billy knows it can't be as dire as his other problems, but also knows that to ignore Art would be to insult him.Who's the kid?I can't manage this team under a one-year contract.No I can't.How about you deal with the manager's contract and then put a team on the field?I have to tell you it's not easy doing what I do under the cloud of a one-year contract.I know you have.

Pinch hitting while Pena plays first base.I brought it up to them during the off- season, and I still do not have my option.I think it's fair to say that.What are you trying to say?Because he can't play first.Not my first baseball game.Scott Hatteberg can't hit.And his defense--Anything else?I do.No, you've made it clear what you think about that. This is about you doing your job and me doing mine.
