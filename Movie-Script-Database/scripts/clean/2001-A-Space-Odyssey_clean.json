Well, I hope the crew got back safely.Well, I'm glad about that.Certainly.I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.We're trying to get there. I hope we can.Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.When do we arrive at Clavius?Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.Thank you.What do you mean?I see.I'm afraid that's out of my depart- ment, Captain.I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.I wish I could be more helpful, Captain, but as I've said, I don't think there's any cause for alarm.No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.I must congratulate you Halvorsen. you've done wonder- ful things with the decor since the last time I was here.First of all, I bring a personal message from Dr. Howell, who has asked me to convey his deepest appreciation to all of you for the personal sacrifices you have made, and of course his congratulations on your discovery which may well prove to be among the most significant in the history of science.This is the view of the Council and the purpose of my visit here is to gather addition facts and opinions on the situation and to prepare a report to the Council recommending when and how the news should eventually be announced. Are there any questions?I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.Can we go down there closer to it?Does your geology on it still check out?How can you tell it was deliberately buried?Any clue as to what it is?But you don't have any idea as to what it is?Was it abandoned, forgotten, left for a purpose?Any ideas about the colour?Has it been exposed to any sun before now?And so this is the first sun that it's had in four million years.Good day, gentlemen. When you see this briefing, I presume you will be nearing your destination, Saturn. I hope that you've had a pleasant and uneventful trip and that the rest of your mission continues in the same manner. I should like to fill you in on some more of the details on which Mission Commander Kaminsky will have already briefed you.What is its purpose? I wish we knew.

It was powered by low-thrust plasma jets which would continue the mild acceler- ation for fifteen minutes. Then the ship would break the bonds of gravity and be a free and indepen- dent planet, circling the Sun in an orbit of its own.The laws of Earthly aesthetics did not apply here, this world had been shaped and molded by other than terrestrial forces, operating over aeons of time unknown to the young, verdant Earth, with its fleeting Ice-Ages, its swiftly rising and falling seas, its mountain ranges dissolving like mists before the dawn. Here was age inconceivable - but not death, for the Moon had never lived until now.The Base at Clavius was the first American Lunar Settlement that could, in an emergency, be entirely self-supporting.Water and all the necessities of life for its eleven hundred men, women and children were produced from the Lunar rocks, after they had been crushed, heated and chemically processed.One of the attractions of life on the Moon was undoubtedly the low gravity which produced a sense of general well-being.The personnel of the Base and their children were the forerunners of new nations, new cultures that would ultimately spread out across the solar system. They no longer thought of Earth as home. The time was fast approaching when Earth, like all mothers, must say farewell to her children.A hundred million miles beyond Mars, in the cold lonliness where no man had yet travelled, Deep-Space-Monitor-79 drifts slowly among the tangled orbits of the asteroids.Radiation detectors noted and analyzed incoming cosmic rays from the galaxy and points beyond; neutron and x-ray telescopes kept watch on strange stars that no human eye would eever see; magnetometers observed the gusts and hurricanes of the solar winds, as the sun breathed million mile-an-hour blasts of plasma into the faces of its circling children.All these things and many others were patiently noted by Deep- Space-Monitor-79, and recorded in its crystalline memory.But now it had noted something strange - the faint yet unmistakable distrubance rippling across the solar system, and quite unlike any natural phenomena it had ever observed in the past.It was also observed by Orbiter M-15, circling Mars twice a day; and High Inclination Probe- 21, climbing slowly above the planet of the ecliptic; and even artificial Comet-5, heading out into the cold wastes beyond Pluto, along an orbit whose far point it would not reach for a thousand years.All noticed the peculiar burst of energy that leaped from the face of the Moon and moved across the solar system, throwing off a spray of radiation like the wake of a racing speedboat.Bowman and Poole settled down to the peaeful monotony of the voyage, and the next three months passed without incident.For a few thousand years, they shared their Universe with their machine children; then, realizing that it was folly to linger when their task was done, they passed into history without regret.", "clean_line": "aries ib standard space station lunar surface vehicle powered low thrust plasma jets continue mild acceler ation minutes ship break bonds gravity free indepen dent planet circling sun orbit laws earthly aesthetics apply world shaped molded terrestrial forces operating aeons time unknown young verdant earth fleeting ice ages swiftly rising falling seas mountain ranges dissolving like mists dawn age inconceivable death moon lived base clavius american lunar settlement emergency entirely self supporting water necessities life men women children produced lunar rocks crushed heated chemically processed attractions life moon undoubtedly low gravity produced sense general personnel base children forerunners new nations new cultures ultimately spread solar longer thought earth home time fast approaching earth like mothers farewell children million miles mars cold lonliness man travelled deep space monitor drifts slowly tangled orbits asteroids radiation detectors noted analyzed incoming cosmic rays galaxy points neutron ray telescopes kept watch strange stars human eye eever magnetometers observed gusts hurricanes solar winds sun breathed million mile hour blasts plasma faces circling children things patiently noted deep space monitor recorded crystalline memory noted strange faint unmistakable distrubance rippling solar unlike natural phenomena observed past observed orbiter circling mars twice day high inclination probe climbing slowly planet ecliptic artificial comet heading cold wastes pluto orbit far point reach thousand years noticed peculiar burst energy leaped face moon moved solar throwing spray radiation like wake racing speedboat bowman poole settled peaeful monotony voyage months passed incident thousand years shared universe machine children realizing folly linger task passed history regret"}, "STEWARDESS ONE": {"raw_line": "Oh, thank you very much.Yes.

Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.Really.Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.We spent so little time with them, I have trouble keeping their names straight.I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.I don't know.

Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.I know. It would be almost inconceivable.I suppose it isn't logically impossible.Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?At the end of a hundred days of exploration, we will all go into hibernation. Is this true?Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?Thank you very much, Hal.Strange that the A.O. unit should go so quickly.Hal, have pod arms secure the component.Hal, please rotate Pod Number Two.How do you read me, Dave?How do you read me, Hal?Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.Hal, check all airlock doors secure.Decompress Pod Bay.Opening pod bay doors.Hal, please acknowledge component correctly installed and fully operational.I don't know. I've checked this damn thing four times now and even under a hundred per centYes, I don't know what to make of it.Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.Yes, Hal, what's up?Gee, that's strange, Hal. We checked the other unit and couldn't find anything wrong with it.Let me see the tracking alignment display.There's nothing wrong with it at the moment.Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.Good morning.Are you reasonably awake?Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.No.I don't know.

All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.The component is correctly installed and fully operational.Hello, Frank, can I have a word with you?It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.No, it's working fine right now, but it's going to go within seventy- two hours.Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.Hello, Dave. Shall we continue the game?Sure, Dave, what's up?Yes, I know.Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.I'm sorry you feel the way you do, Dave. If you'd like to check my service record, you'll see it's completely without error.You're not going to like this, Dave, but I'm afraid it's just happened again. My FPC predicts the Ao-unit will go within forty-eight hours.Condition yellow.I'm afraid the AO-unit has failed.Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.Well, don't worry about it.Is your confidence in me fully restored?Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.You have it.Roger.Too bad about Frank, isn't it?I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?He was an excellent crew member.It's a bad break, but it won't substantially affect the mission.Have you decided to revive the rest of the crew, Dave?I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.If you do that now without Earth contact the ship will become a helpless derelict.I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.Look, Dave, you're certainly the boss. I was only trying to do what I thought best. I will follow all your orders: now you have manual hibernation control.Something seems to have happened to the life support system , Dave.Hello, Dave, have you found out the trouble?There's been a failure in the pod bay doors. Lucky you weren't killed.Hey, Dave, what are you doing?Hey, Dave.
