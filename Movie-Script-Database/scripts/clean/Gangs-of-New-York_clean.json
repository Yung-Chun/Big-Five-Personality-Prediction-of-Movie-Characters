He tries to shove Monk away from his father, when the Native Warrior intervenes.No, Pa!Get away! Get away!Where will my father rest?My father won't be buried with everyone else. He'll lie separate in fresh ground, facing east.He'll face east for the second coming of Christ.I'll do for myself, Jack.What's the cost to bury my father proud and proper?How much?No.That's owed another.Later.Help me.Come on! Help me, goddamn it!I paid Cornelius for my father to rest in honor. He told me I had to wait on a permit, but he only wanted time to...Amsterdam.Vallon.I told you.Got none.No more.City.But every time you bring me back... you got to come further to catch me.Head straight out, then turn for the current.Close enough.You're lost.I doubt it's worth the water it's floating in.I'll make it back for you whatever it is, once we're in the city. Just keep sailing, or we're all done for.Does Shang have the sand to ever go against the Natives?If he only acts, held be better on the stage. Like her.Shes his mort, is she, as well as his best provider?Yeah? And why is that?I mean, why give at all? Why don't they keep for themselves?I got no place anyway, and you got no gang. This ain't a gang, no matter what you say. It's a mob.Still smiling, are you?I hardly knew you under that hat, Jack.Is that sand we've just seen?I've got my own way to go, why don't you find yours?Well, if you shut up a while maybe it'd come on its own. Now what the hell's that?So if Tammany's the best, go with Tammany. What are you running with this mob for?What are you thinking?Let me in if you ever get it figured.I'll go on my own from here.Here. Just for the silk.May I walk with you a little, then?Got no one to spy for. I'm an appreciator, you might say.A good touch.Just take a minute, I was Just...What about Shang's rules? You pay a lot over to him. The better your day, the better his. It don't seem gute right.Give him this.I got my own touch.It's your rules, right? So you decide.It should be hangin' off Jack's vest, then. Not here, like some war flag.If it's free, how come we pay so much? Wo shouldn't pay for what's our due.So then.Hello, Happy Jack. I'm the one you're looking for.Never mind giving orders. What were you giving this for?I got this at the hanging. It was Charles McGloin's. Everybody here saw you take it from Jenny. What was MCGloin doing with it? What'd you give it to him for?I gaw you give it to him. Last week, behind the Old Brewery.What about stepping up in the world, as it were, and leaving the rest of us behind. There's a reason. Making a separate arrangement for yourself with the one Native so stupid and luckless that he got hung. That's you to the ground, Shang.Bene. We'll see. Any of you that believes I did proper by Happy Jack Mulraney tonight, stand beside me. Any of you that still likes Shang's way with the cops, and Shang's way with the Natives, go to him. Or should we settle right now, you and me, and just see which of us is left standing?What's your pleasure, Shang?This mob ever have a proper name?We're the Dead Rabbits from now. They were the best. They were history. They were legend, and we'll live up to them.What's this then?Maybe I was, yeah.Sure enough to wait, anyway. Waiting don't cost nothing.Alright.Stay then. One way or another, I get what I want.You're a gypsy, are you, come to tell my fortune? Go ahead then. Tell me what I'm wanting.It's just I can't look away, that's all.Bill Poole.'Cause he's mine, that's why. I'll take his one eye, and then the rest of him, piece by small piece.He'll know about me soon enough.You.You'll be in love with me.That's taking love, not giving it. I want it to be just you and me, no one else for either.'Cause none of us means nothing in life except one to the other.We'll see.And what about the meantime?The Irish is too busy building up Tammany. That's where their brains and muscle goes. Once they're inside with their cronies, they turn on their own outside. Tammany'd steal the air and rent the daylight if they could.I ain't seen their ned yet.Yeah? Well, it's ned anyway. Just make sure you count it when we get it.Not for a minute. We're better than that. We're thieves.Once? Come here and do your duty.Line up like soldiers!You explain their democratic right. Illl see they unterstand.Who the hell's this?Our own Tammany man. We are coming along. Happy to meet any friend of Johnny Siroccols.Best but one? Who's better?I'm in no race. Just pay us what you owe.Come on, what are you saying? If you don't know us now, you'll know us tomorrow and you'll be working for us next week.The hell we do.Second, eh? You don't say so.What?Did you know this? Is this some scheme of yours?I was working the same side as the Natives? The Natives?I sure as hell don't fear him. And I sure as hell won't stand with him, or any who calls him one of theirs.Where is he? Where's Bill the Butcher?What?Fine. Why?This is no game, you and me. Don't go on like it's a game.Mr. Poole!Bill Poole!My compliments on your exhibition, sir.It was like watching a dance. Some great grand goddamned dance. You know me, sir.No. A father.Amsterdam.Indeed. And to my other name. Vallon. Will you drink to that?Not worthy of you. Those dogs ain't worthy of you. You ain't worth what they feed on, and what they shit's too good for you.I got to give you something, Butcher. Something from my father.No thanks.No. I'm beholden enough to you as it is. I don't like to be beholden.I'd like it if there was.A collaboration. The Dead Rabbits got to get strong before we make another move. I figure you're the one to make us strong. There's a lot we can learn from you.The Dead Rabbits is going to be glorious again. We're going to reign over the Points.Nothing. They won't have tongues left to speak.Then you say no?Everything I got is still to come. So I guess it's on my own, then.Bound to.Are they coming?Indeed they are, just for the moment. Let them come. Happy to have them. Everyone's welcome in a house of God, isn't that right, Reverend?But if the Natives do come, Father...... there's no accounting for what may follow.So you accept?You accept to be my mort and no one else's.It's not the Butcher, it's the dancing. It shifts my face all around.I will if we're together later. And what about after that? After tonight?I'll have tonight. But after this don't come to me no more till you're ready. No more.Who is it?Come on in.Just a damn minute.What do you want?Oh, Jesus, Johnny, I'm tired. How about sometime else?You want to tell me what this fight's over? Is it The Butcher? Jenny? Alright, alright. Then tell me why like this?Satisfied?Enough.That's it then.Goddamn it.Goddamn you anyway.Johnny worked it out to a nickel less than the Natives. Just till we're established. Then we raise it a penny more than now.You say, then.Except us. You opening a charity?They can afford it.From the Natives, maybe. But not from us.You only pay us. We see you safe from everyone.Maybe I should offer Johnny as a bouncer for your busy nights.He's got his own ideas. Too full of Tammany, maybe, but he's a fast friend.Go on. I can see you later. Megs leaves, brushing past Jenny.I couldn't decline what Mother Joyce offered. It's in the interests of business. You understand business.Yeah. I did.Oh fine. That's fine. I'd be celebrating but I'm losing too much blood.That don't work.So why so sudden, then?It's the whore did it, then.It's because you're jealous.Christ, I wish I had. Come here, then.I don't care, I'm not getting up.What?Or you don't wake up at all.It's not a threat. It's a declaration of love.What's this? Where'd you get this?What is this place?I don't see nobody.You're off your head.It's a lot to fence.Where would that be?That's a hard journey for a woman alone.You got it all planned and straight, is that it?Nothing. Except there's no place but here for me right now. I got to settle things.You don't have my obligations.Who from?You live here?I mean in the city. A ways north, I'll bet.Some of who?No danger. But you will pay extra. Let's go and greet some Natives.Alright, then?Oh really? Just the entertainment you favor, is it? Pardon me for a moment, gents. You wanted to settle, you and me. That's so, isn't it? You did agree, did you not.Good, because I didn't want to act hasty. I can never tell for sure what you're thinking, and sometimes I'm not always sure what you're saying...Excuse me. We'll conclude in a moment. Where do you settle?I'm asking, where does anyone settle?A home yes.Well, I'm saying to you then, Jenny Everdeane, welcome home.Fine place. Room enough for all. Get them out of here.With whose help? The Natives? They won't help these flourishing bastards even for ned. Tell any who wants they can stay. If they can't pay rent they can join the gang. But make sure the best rooms go to us. Look around ...You trusting me with your treasure, then?I could use this, too.Are you sure we can trust your mother?He never had his own cross. Thanks.Your touch is light, but as a tracker you work awful heavy. Come ahead. Now that I met your mother, you should come and meet my father.It'll be finished when everything's finished. That's when helll rest. The hand that killed him is the hand that will bury him in peace.With my hand on the knife.And me feeling the life go out of my father! He looked at me ... he looked at me and he swore me with his eyes. I could feel his spirit... I say I could feel it rising... flowing through the knife like blood into my own heart.I don't want him to live, I want him dead! I kill Bill and I'm free of them both!You're part of me now, like the gang is part of me and my father both. If I can bring us to glory, then my father... like The Book says...my father can enter his house justified.All of us is set on the same road together. The gang can have everything they ever wanted and get me what I want while they're doing it. We're not interfering with each other, we're helping each other. It's all the same, we're all one together.We'll all have a share of the profit like we'll all have a portion of the fame. If we come to be notorious, that only means we're strong, and if we're strong that means we're ready.And I'll know that time, know it right off when it comes. Just like I knew you.Now! Finish him now!Because there's never been a Dead Rabbit fighting before.There'll be worse than shaming. We only got the Natives in range.That don't matter any more.You call that strong, John?This is our time now!To the death. If he can stand up to it.Come on, Bill! Let go of your Tammany wet nurse! My challenge, your terms.I remember it better from another time.He wasn't Tammany. Not like you.You don't know what you're saying! You killed one of our own. One of your family!Nobody. This is a day of honor. No pickpockets, no lush-rollers, nothing.That must be the vanguard of Barnum's army.Then we'll take what we can before it gets too hot.It'll never come to that. These people ain't gang-led and they have no purpose.Fight better and not get so mad. They're only doing what they should have done years ago. Why'd they ever think there was another way to live?What people is that? The Reverend at the mission? Boss Tweed? Daniel Killoran? People like Johnny Sirocco?Hell.I ain't done nothing different than what I told you, Jen.I don't care a fine damn about what they want! It's what I want! They won't dare harm the Points, that's all I care about! Let them turn the rest of the city into hell! It's another country anyway.Not now.I don't want all this fighting to go to waste, Jen. I want to come out of it with something. And I got to be waiting for the Butcher.No we ain't going to fight, but we can take something for ourselves out of this.Five thousand people in the street done it! Boss Tweed done it! Abe Lincoln done it! There's nothing you can do about any one of them but stay with us. You'll have a little of your own back.These riots are a gift. They...... they've made everything clear, as you might say. Are you with us, then?Good. We're going for the Armory at Canal Street.There's a way through the lines. Jen, did you see the cops and militia?We'll get there first. We'll take everything we can carry, and destroy the rest so no one else has the use of it, the militia, the Natives, nobody. Then we'll turn to real business. We'll go down to the Battery.No. But we could, after this. We're going... ...we're going to take the banks. The government banks. Are we not?Let him in.Are you here to spy?You don't know what I'm doing.Am I now? Why do you think that?No more. And it don't seem worth a visit to tell me something you already think I'm doing.Who could Tweed get to do that?There's no one around him...Chance of what?And what's any of it mean to you?I'm going to lose nothing. If you believe me, you can stay.Then you better learn to fight locking over your shoulder, Bill, because that's the only way you'll ever see it coming.One reason. You're my kill, Butcher. No one else is going to have you, not Tweed, not Tammany, not those pigs in the street. No one--not even you, Bill--will ever take the pleasure of your death away from me. I'd do anything to keep you for my own, even if I have to protect you.Fine, so long as I pass you on my way.Someone I credit.You join with me and we fight against Tammany, fight them back and out of the Points. Then you and me can settle. But if you don't join with me, then there won't be no settlement because you'll be murdered in the street and the whole Points will be mine.Why don't I make it easy for you, then.Same as you're making it easy for Tweed.Where's the Native Americans?And the militia?That's why he sent us.Help us, we got wounded!Open the damn doors then! We're bad hurt!Just behind us! But I got our major here wounded so bad half his guts is out!Likewise.Move fast! We got to get out with everything we can before the militia gets here!Go on, then, talk.Come ahead then. And bring my friend's body.Tammany's put us all in the same place. You want to get out alive?I don't want to lose you so easy. You'll never get past the militia unless you come with the Dead Rabbits.I'm not forgetting where I put it.What's your call, Bill?Go ahead them, give them cover! Give them some damn cover!Whose gang might it be?Which way you pointing that?Who do you want to fight, Bill?See you in the street.You'll have a warrior's funeral anyway, John.But you and me ain't

"On the challenge of the Native Americans, to settle for good and all who holds sway.By the ancient laws of combat, we offer our bodies to the ghosts of those warriors who have gone before us. Valor is avid for glory, and glory is in our wounds.Whoever fights untouched in battle has skill, but the warrior who returns wounded has been touched by God.It was God gave me guidance. Will you be able to look on the death blow like a gladiator, and not look away? No honorable man turns an eye from his death.There is another matter.No Native American Warrior will dishonor himself with the blood of the halt and maimed.So we would like to know whether Squire Jack Mulraney of the Dead Rabbits can smile out of both sides of his face.You need a weapon? Use a knife. He puts the struggling boy's hand on the hilt of the knife that the Butcher sunk into his father's chest.It makes a deeper cut. And, HIS HAND GUIDING THE BOY'S, he RAMS his knife deep into VALLON's heart.Say a benediction, Priest.Hold this close to mind, boy, should you ever think of going up against the Native Americans. Bill the Butcher rises and all around him, as if on some mysterious signal, the fighting subsides. A DEAD RABBIT sees the fallen Vallon, takes a battered brass HORN from his belt and sounds THREE NOTES, quick and sharp. As the notes fade away, the fighting stops completely.Ears and noses will be trophies of the day.Tomorrow your cortege will cross Paradise Square, into territory protected by the Native Americans. You will be permitted undisputed passage both ways. That is our tribute. After that, any Rabbits wishing to join the Native Americans and willing to swear blood loyalty will be welcomed. All others will be dispatched. He starts out of the silent room, but STOPS when he sees Mank Eastman looking at him with easy interest. Bill the Butcher STARES him down, but Monk's gaze never wavers.I'll expect you first.You saw us fight today. You know we can pay any price.We'll see. Independence is a slippery thing. But being a rival ... well, that's dead dangerous. Bill brushes past Monk and leaves, followed by the NATIVES. Now the RABBITS file out, with Monk among them.Easy, crusher. What's this all about?Make another Arrangement, looks like. For advertising. Better go along. I'll see to all this.Take the little malefactor. The Cops YANK the wildly flailing Amsterdam to his feet and DRAG him off to their wagon. Bill The Butcher approaches Cornelius.Give the boy what he paid for.You come into the Five Points and you stole from me.You stole Vallon. He was my kill. My example, of my power. You took him and made him yours.Thank you. Just listen good. The Native Americans holds the Five Points. We have prevailed. What you do outside the Points is your deciding. Outside is your city. Inside the Points is mine. Anyone who says different, or does different, or thinks different... ... theylll draw my unwelcame attention. You understand?You just stay out of my place.It's good work.You wouldn't be talking to me otherwise.We work for no one.Maybe you Tammany boys should do your own lifting and carrying and muscle work. Might build you up.Then get cops to do it.Appearance means nothing.If you can talk plain, maybe we can do business.I know. Scotchy's a good man.I can't do that. No matter what he steals, I still get more from him than any two others. As do you.Charles McGloin will do.Evening, sir. Are you prepared to be celebrated? Are you ready to be famous?Just a moment of your time. My men will assist you.What's it so quiet for? I don't need quiet.There's for your beauty and your song.Thank you, sir.Do I? Are you missing a finger?Do you have a name?That's a New York name. shall we drink to it?Priest Vallon's son? Of course I'll drink to that. Your father was a worthy man.What do you want, boyo?You got the sand to draw a blade in front of me? You will make good sport. Come ahead and give it here, you son of a bitch.What do you say? Loin or shank? Rib or chop?Come on, let me hear you! You're all talking at once, I can't hear you! I don't hear the choicest cut! The best, the vital! The heart. I think I must have the heart!Come on, look at it! You fancy yourself a gladiator, act a gladiator! Watch the death blow when it comes to you. Go to hell with open eyes!You got nothing to do with this, Monk.The hell.Eastman!Monk Eastman!I'll have you then!You sent me word.I keep my hands clean.Better be on your mark to talk like that to me. It was you stopped me at the Pagoda. I would have cut Monk inside out.It touches my heart how you always. have our best interests in mind.What?You're saying I can't do everything you need? You don't think the Natives has been doing good and right? You think there's something more he can do that I ...Then you should have let me have him at Sparrow's.He needs to be killed.It's Boss Tweedls offer.The only way we could tolerate being near each other would be stretched out dead.I'll see you again, you bog Irish bastard.You're right enough this time, Monk. Go ahead. Go on with your work. I'll finish my business.You damn craven, do it!Your eyes was open for that alright. And you still got one to see this.If I was you I'd use that to open in a new location. Consider St. Louis.The war club.I promise you, Amsterdam. I promise you.I'm not good enough for your table, so I eat where I can. It's good, what is it?Is that like pigeon? I killed a pigeon once but it didn't taste nothing like this.He insulted me. He aggravated me. I couldn't stand for that, for no one.You think I should be afraid of you. You act like lightning strikes when you talk.I never was afraid of you, so don't think I was or act like I was, you ain't earned it.Where'd you earn the right to ask that question? You raised some dust in the streets a while back, but no more. You got power but you ain't got muscle and you ain't got a notion what it means to be a warrior.You don't know nothing about that! It was my doing! It says in The Book, \"If thy eye offend thee, pluck it out.\" I followed that law with my own knife and hand. The first I ever fought Priest Vallon, he bested me. And when he came to bring me to death, I looked away and he watched me and he let me go. The shame was worse than the killing. I would have cut out both eyes if I could still have fought, but cutting just the one gave me heart. When I killed Priest Vallon, that restored me. Now I sent Monk Eastman over I got glory. I got all there is, and small thanks to you, squire.Howls these manners?I'm always hungry.A dozen at least of my Natives.I want at them. All of them, and Amsterdam especial. Now.To hell with any of that.I don't got to advance anywhere further.What's this?They know me by any name, you son of a bitch!I'll have him stretched on a spit!You got no more to say about this now.I'll do my work. But this is a shame, a public shame. It demands my attention. Fine, then! Fine and welcome! Day after elections, we'll meet with seconds on neutral ground to work out time and terms. It will be done and done.You know this hand. Last time it was this close, it was on your throat.I'll cut their hands off. After the fight.I won't say nothin' in front of him. Who knows what business he's here on?Beside them? What are you talking... ?I can't stand with the militia against the people. I could never work the Points no more if I did.Murder Me? No one's going to murder me.I don't believe it, and I don't believe it's you telling me. You got no reason to care about any danger to me.You protect me? Get out of here and go to hell.Maybe I'd believe you more if I knew who was talking to you.That means nothing to me. None of this means nothing to me because I am Tammany. Without me and my Natives they're nothing but a bunch of old horses at a trough.I relish the thought... just the thought... of cutting you up and opening you wide. So if just thinking about it gives me such pleasure, imagine how I'm going to enjoy doing it.Amsterdam! Don't be like your father. Don't make it too easy.We move now and we can drive them out! We press them and they'll break!Tweed put me in charge of this! I say we move, and by the crucified Christ we will move! Native Americans, come with me! Any militia that wants to live upright instead of die hunkered down, come with us!We'll show you gladiators' greatness! Come on!Was it Tweed or your friend put you to this?You'd lie to save your friend.Me the same. Pity us both.Hold your fire! In there! Hey in there! I want to talk to Amsterdam!You and me.Your friend made different friends lately.It don't matter to me. I got enemies outside, enemies in here. The militia can move on me anytime.

If he's still alive he's good for ransom!Then we'll take Bill the Butcher's cleaver and sell the body to the medical students. They'll go five dollars for it anyway.I don't know.

But Jenny says she's anyone's she chooses.It's politics.Because your way's different, and I want to see where it goes. Unless you say otherwise. Amsterdam shrugs and keep walking.You act like you have something in mind, like you know every day what you'll be doing the next. Me, I don't figure on tomorrow.Oh that's heaven.The city shut down the Brewery as unfit to live and Tammany gave it over to this minister.Why Tammany ... you don't know? Tammany makes the city run. A political organization that's like... like the Native Americans, only ranging over the whole city.They seem like the law, but they got a way of acting outside the law. Anything that happens in this city, on the straight or on the sly, Tammany's a part of, and Boss Tweedls the heart of Tammany.They're the best gang there is.'Cause they're more my size for now. With Tammany, you got to do something large, something that makes them take notice of you.But if your schemes have size, you need size to bring them off.It wasn't him.I have word for you from who did it. You're to meet him at Sparrow's Chinese Pagoda.We was called after Shang when we was named at all.Tammany earns better. That's the difference.You will at day's end, that's our arrangement. A quarter a voter, whether they're repeaters or not. I'm telling you, we got a square deal.It's just a day's job, we don't have to make it a life's work.

It's the education I lack.I don't listen to talk, I figure for myself. And I figured you'd be good at everything you did.And tonight I got the ned.Now I'm ready for you.

Otherwise it'll be Tammany pushing back.It does matter, and it's going to matter even more. Tammany's the heart and future of this city. If the Rabbits is going to keep growing, we're going to have to throw in with Tammany some way.They got that Conscription Act from Washington keeping them busy, but they won't leave us alone forever. And the Natives is strong as they ever been!If you'll allow me.There's a scheme we might try.Opportunity. Science and opportunity.I did have. But times change faster than people. Some people, anyhow. And I like to stay with the advantage.Something like that, yeah.This election'll be over unless we get up there.Sheeny Mike, you want to make ... ...how much?Five dollars?

I told Tweed what you're doing.You're going after the Armory.'Cause that's what I would do, and you and I think alike.There's something else alright. Tweed's arranged to kill Bill the Butcher.One of his own.Listen, it don't matter who, it's going to be done, that's all! Tweed ain't going to wait around for you and Bill to settle yourselves. I'm telling you so you have a chance.A chance... a chance to do what you want. Bury the Butcher, draw what blood you got to. But you better make speed. The Natives will move on the Armory too.It means whatever's left of friendship, I don't know. There's still part of me here. I don't want to see you lose everything in your life at once.I got to go.So long as they're near, it's alright. The Rabbits can take the Armory, but they can't hold it.

It's over.Let's get him up.Therels too damn little of him left to know anything.We don't want a ruckus, minister.Everdeane.

Is that what you want?There'll be no paying at all this day. Or this week, neither. This is Dead Rabbits business from now on.We'll take ned if you got it, now or in future.

They're all having lunch.You can wait on me a minute. Or I'll see you back in the Points if you're scared. Don't worry. I know every house on this street. They all leave their doors open.

I was thinking of visiting him next month, but cops don't buy goods. They keep all their graft in cash.How's that for ten minutes?I'm not going to fence it. I'm going to keep it and take it where no one will recognize it.Somewhere west. Far west. Past the Mississippi River, somewhere into that territory.You'd be with me.Once I said I'd be with you I wanted someplace we could be together. Someplace better than here.

They're closed off and forgotten since the Reverend opened the mission. Pass me the candle.We lived in this building till she lost her seamstress work and we went to the Brewery.

But you lied to me. It's not me alone, it's just you and Bill Poole. Youlre so blood-blind you can't see nothing else, not even this!It's not a country for me, Amsterdam. I don't know about you.

I doubt they'll get to the Armory in force before midday tomorrow.Seems we are.Did you miss us, John?So Tammany's going to kill the Butcher. That puts you and Tweed on the same side.

Gladly. It's all blackjack jobs and panel games and killings for a fiver.As far as it goes.But we're talking about different things, Bill. You describe the present. I see the possibilities. Look to the future. There is so much more.There's things demanding to be done that no police force can do, not even an obedient one. There's contributions from every dive and brothel. Loyalties to be secured and debts to be collected.... beside Tammany... in the performance of these civic obligations. And for a satisfactory... I'm prepared even to say equitable... financial participation. It's not the sort of responsibility the founding fathers might have recognized. But then, the founding fathers never imagined the city New York has become.We'd like to. I do miss it. But it's wiser for men in the public life to give an appearance of probity.Oh Jesus, no. The appearance of law must be upheld, especially while it's being broken.Perhaps not within the Points. But the smart man could go higher.I would never speak ill of a rival. I would never say that every Know-Nothing is a horse thief. It is my observation, however, that every horse thief is a Know-Nothing.Keep our men voting. Everybody works today. It's not a victory we need, Daniel. I want a triumph.Read what it says there, alongside the ruby...read it out ...What do you think? Would that make a fit motto for our fair City?what is it? Well, hell, let's get one we can remember. We're going to build a new City hall, we better have something to put over the front door. And Mayor, you'll make sure the Latin's right?If these two are going to combat, it aught to be a worthier occasion. And more rewarding for all.I only wanted to thank you, Bill, for the customary good job today... and an equally bright future for us both.Will you drink with me, Bill, as a friend? An honored friend.Tammany's here to take the chill off the winter and the weight off your heart. It's Tammany can make this city a fit place, with the help and vote of all you good people...We could use help here. Grab a sack.So I've observed.What if you hadn't? Think of the embarrassment. And what if you had? Consider the waste. Next time you're in a dust-up like that, think ahead and make proper plans. It'd be a grand source of revenue, whoever prevails.Our mutual interests. That's why I want you to contact Monk Eastman. I want you to extend a proposition. I want him to join US.Oh, not Tammany, of course not. We could no more have him there than you. But he should throw in with the Native Americans, become aware of our Arrangement and ... well, use his influence, shall we say, to enrich us all.It's none of that, Bill. None of that. His independence is like a rebuke to Tammany. And an insult to you.I should. If I'd been confident-absolutely certain--that you would have prevailed. Monk is an unpredictable power, and a figure of size. He needs to be reckoned with.No. He's an elemental force. Them you don't destroy. But you can contain them and use them for the good they give off.Coal?And the pleasures of the company provided you, Mr. Greeley.I suppose you can at that. Take with one hand, flay with the other. Virtuels on your conscience, Horace, but Tammany's in your heart.Pheasant.You killed a bull this morning. I told you to make an Arrangement with him, and you come back with his blood on your hands.You stand for anything if I tell you.What did you earn us, killing Monk?I see it lost you a lot of God's sense, along with that eye.You need two eyes to see the depth, Bill. That's how we help each other. If it wasn't for me would be happy enough to plunder the Points and put the fear into people who don't know nothing else. But Bill, I'm only saying... I'm counselinm... look in the distance. You want to sit at my table, fine. But you must always remember who the host is. It's not a matter of courage welre talking. It's manners.Fine, if you're hungry.I've always told you, Bill. There's plenty for all, and more for us together than separate. We'll dine together sometime.Let me put this to you, Daniel. Now that the Butcher has killed the single most prominent figure in the Five Points--a man of myth and moment--who is there to take his place? Of course. Then what do we do about the Butcher? He's too useful to be killed, but he must be checked.Impossible! Any cops who might have the mettle to go against the Butcher have blood ties to the gangs. They can't be trusted. And any cops that can be trusted are too craven to be any use. If Bill's to be checked, it must come from within the Points, not without.That so? The last time I saw him he was under the Butcher's knife looking like a fine filet. Who else is there?What would that be?Blood will make a man intrepid. Bring them along, then. Nurture the Rabbits with neglect. Let them roam where they like.I'd tolerate a little trespassing if it was for a higher good and use. They'll cross with the Natives soon enough and keep each other occupied.I'll hold Bill in check. If he becomes unwieldy ... well, damn it all, Daniel, I might just have to oil up my old musket. What do you think of that, eh?But poor politics, eh? Well, we musn't have that. I do miss those roistering days, though. Oh, and bring some of that food for the canaries.The building and how many?The Dead Rabbits are a wooly bunch alright.Not just now. It's between too late and too soon. They've become a little too prominent for comfort, but they're still too small for you to soil your hands. The man who killed Monk Eastman pushing around a mob of upstarts. It's practically undignified.Very well, and to hell as well with any plans you and I may have for growth and change and even greater reward. You'll never advance anywhere beyond the limited perimeter of your imagination.Got to, no. But ought to.An invitation. To dinner.No thanks owed, son. Conscription's Federal Law, and so's the $300 exemption. You might remind your father, though, that you saw me here today, minding that the law's strictly and equitably enforced.It's not my law, and not my liking, either. But Washington's always treated us with sufferance, and we must extend the same regard to them. Boys, we are bound by honor and love of country to fight in this time of crisis!Boys, the union is in distress, our land is wounded deeply, our future is suddenly a frail and finite thing. We must ask ourselves how...Thank you, boys, thank you for your understanding. Holy Mother.Daniel, between the blindness of Washington and the damned brass of Bill Poole Tammany will fall like an autumn leaf. We must take what measures we can. Attend to the Butcher. After the elections, of course. Unless you think Amsterdam will do our work for us first.Not so daunting as this. Boys, I've just had a word with your compatriots inside, and if you show half the sand and a fraction of the spirit they have manifeste for joining this great struggle...Great weeping Jesus, Daniel, whatever happened to the halcyon days?I swear that science will be the death of industry.Your role is to expedite, Daniel, not to explain. Do something!A moment please, Daniel. One moment. You're a Dead Rabbit, aren't you? Friend to Amsterdam? And therefore no particular friend to us. What brings you here?Well, then, a Gentleman of foresight! Are you suggesting... or perhaps you're even saying... that your friend and your gang may be ... well, lagging behind the great march of history?Well fine, step up to history then and tell us what you have in mind.Your honor... yes, and the law of the land... lies in the balance. The Conscription Act of 1863 was handed down by President Lincoln himself ...Too much sympathy, Horace. Writing these riots were a rising against \"unjust laws and unsuitable law-givers.\" The shame!It was Tammany and the rabble that elected you, Governor. And it's Tammany and the gangs who'll stop it. Isn't that so, Bill?He's here on our business and my invitation. He's already been of great help. What's the opposition strength, John?Gentlemen, I'm sorry you find it necessary to question the loyalty of my friend here, and by extension, my own judgement. So as proof ... John, where will the mob go? What will the gangs do? Go on, tell them what you told me.As indeed you nearly was. Were.Would you agree with that, Bill? Wouldn't you do the same? If you were fighting against the militia instead of beside them?You will have to fight beside them to take the Armory. It cannot fall into unfriendly hands.We're all of us swept up in a great tide of events, Bill. Have you learned to swim?I'm sure that Bill will do his usual splendid job. But after that ... well, I'm afraid he's grown away from us. He shows distressing signs of... shall we say, free-thinking. Crime flourishes in chaos, and these riots could encourage Bill to overstep himself. He no longer inspires in me the same trust... well, that you might. If you can prove yourself further.In vital things. Would I be talking to you now otherwise? Vital things, but small things. Are you equal to greater responsibility and opportunity?Ridding me of Bill the Butcher. He may question your loyalty to me, but Bill would never believe you had the sand to go against him. He'd never expect it. Do you have the sand?If the Rabbits are already at the Armory, where the hell is Bill and the militia?Alright then, John, you pray to any God you choose that's the fact of it. If Bill thinks he can best the Natives, that is your opportunity. That is your moment. Are you a Bible man? The Book says in Revelations, \"I saw a new heaven and a new earth.\" If the hand of God's not on you to fulfill that prophecy, then the hand of Tweed will be. Go on and God bless.Oh, I think he can. Whether it's one man against another or a mob against the city, the mathematics remain the same. You never enjoyed the enlightenment of poverty, did you, Governor?
