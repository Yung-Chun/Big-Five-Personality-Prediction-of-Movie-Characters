And I was holding her when the officers came in.I can't be sure. We were, mostly on the floor, fighting... I couldn't -No. As I explained -I don't know -She didn't -Look...Look out!He isn't going to make it unless he gets to a hospital. Fast.Just where the hell are we?It's locked. Where're your keys?Which one? This? This one?!Help me get him -Can you hear me, sir?What's he look like?Every time I look in the mirror ... but without the beard.Excuse me...Here...How is he?Tell the E.R. doctor he's also got a perforated spleen.I didn't kill my wife.Walter Gutherie please.Some soup, please.Which way are you going?Walter. It's Richard.I wasn't worrying about appearances, Walter.I'm not turning myself in. I need money.St. Louis.How're you doing, Charlie?Yeah. And I need your help.I need some money.

Want me to wait till you're finished?Fine.Yes, I did.Excuse me. I was having a bad shift.Lots of them over the years. Here, long ago. Hasn't changed much.Hey. Hey!They just sent this one up.Wrong...Seventy-five. Hell, yes.What else?What do you mean?It's a hobby of mine -What do you want?I'm a janitor. I did what I was told.Yes... This is Dr. Elway at Cook County. I'm doing follow-up work for the Prosthetic Clinic on Matthew Zelick... He did... I'm terribly sorry. No, I'll correct our files. Thank you.Hello... looking for your brother, Clive. This is Ted Riley with the high school reunion committee. Believe it or not, 25 years is just around the corner, and Clive's on our list of lost souls. Information gave me a number, but when I tried it...No kidding?... Armed robbery. He's where?Clive Driscoll.Sorry. I made a mistake.Officers - there's a man in the stairwell waving a gun and screaming.Do you remember what I told you in the tunnel?Remember what you said to me?You said, 'I don't care.'Well, I am trying to solve the puzzle, Gerard and I just found a piece.This an R.D.U.90 patient?It's very important I reach him.Can you talk?I found him, Charlie. I found the guy that killed Helen.It's all about a drug, Charlie. They tried to kill me because of a drug.Devlin-MacGregor and Lentz. Lentz was supervising the R.D.U.90 protocol. He knew I'd found out the drug had problems. It's Lentz.I need your help. Call Mr. Roosevelt and tell him I'm coming in.You too, Roosevelt... Been a long time.Thanks, Roosevelt.I loaned you something once, Kath, and I need them back.Half the people in the study were indigents. No follow-up, no baseline on them. Who could say they didn't come into the study with bad livers?- drug induced hepatitis.Cold normal.That's statistically impossible.They'd be home free if I hadn't been leaning on them to account for the livers I was seeing. And I wouldn't have seen the livers if I hadn't told the guys on my service to call me when they had cases that were bleeding excessively in surgery.Why not? He's one of the original patent holders. Toss the samples I sent, replace them with healthy samples, issue the path report on the healthy stuff-piece of cake.When did Lentz die?Because a good third of the samples Lentz approved were signed after he died.Someone else used Lentz's name.They wouldn't have had the access. They would have needed someone at the hospital.To see an old friend.Good, it's my stop, too.Not as easy as Helen, was it? You missed your stop.What's wrong, Charlie? Surprised?After Lentz died, you were the only one that had access to the pathology reports.You switched the samples and falsified the reports so R.D.U.90 could get approval.I have a set of the original samples.You almost pulled it off, Charlie. But I know all about it now, and I can prove it.Ladies and gentlemen. My friend, as you can see, is obviously not well. Richard, if you want to talk -I didn't come here to talkYou missed your chance, Charlie...You took everything away from me... for money.I want to know, Charlie... was it worth it...?Hey, Chuckles...I thought you told me 'you didn't care.'", "clean_line": "deal hospital buys new house huh tonic water lime sell soul trips bulls tickets nat slicing dave turn hip hey jim yeah livers appeared hepatetic sure fix time ve seen leave thank dr kimble okay tell ll minutes tim got problem cavalry pro time talk family okay clamping tolerate choice marie clamp husband know tonight marie liver referred wave future marie told frank frank jealous late night thing ve got going hold bleeding stopped let biopsy send downstairs sure kath slice got date hi minutes away home hear won bulls game helen hang babe going right think saw second knocked hand yes smith going guy trying rob guys got minds kill wife know saw walter kill wife holding officers came sure floor fighting couldn explained know look look isn going gets hospital fast hell locked keys help hear sir look like time look mirror beard excuse tell doctor got perforated spleen kill wife walter gutherie soup way going walter richard wasn worrying appearances walter turning need money st louis charlie yeah need help need money ve got ll thanks charlie good morning said sick uhhh asshole ve got clean blinds office want wait till finished fine yes excuse having bad shift lots years long ago hasn changed hey hey sent wrong seventy hell yes mean hobby want janitor told yes dr elway cook county follow work prosthetic clinic matthew zelick terribly sorry ll correct files thank hello looking brother clive ted riley high school reunion committee believe years corner clive list lost souls information gave number tried kidding armed robbery clive driscoll sorry mistake officers man stairwell waving gun screaming remember told tunnel remember said said care trying solve puzzle gerard piece patient important reach talk charlie guy killed helen drug charlie tried kill drug devlin macgregor lentz lentz supervising protocol knew drug problems lentz need help mr roosevelt tell coming roosevelt long time thanks roosevelt loaned kath need half people study indigents follow baseline come study bad livers drug induced hepatitis cold normal statistically impossible home free hadn leaning account livers seeing wouldn seen livers hadn told guys service cases bleeding excessively surgery original patent holders toss samples sent replace healthy samples issue path report healthy stuff piece cake lentz die good samples lentz approved signed died lentz wouldn access needed hospital old friend good stop easy helen missed stop wrong charlie surprised lentz died access pathology reports switched samples falsified reports approval set original samples pulled charlie know prove ladies gentlemen friend obviously richard want talk come talkyou missed chance charlie took away money want know charlie worth hey chuckles thought told care"}, "NICHOLS": {"raw_line": "Richard, I just saw someone who wanted to meet you...Richard Kimble...
