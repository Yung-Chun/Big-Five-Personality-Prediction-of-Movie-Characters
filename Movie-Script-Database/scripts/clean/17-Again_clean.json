{"17-Again": {"MIKE": {"raw_line": "Just warming up, Coach.That's the plan coach.Hold on. Ed's not here yet.And you suck, Dom, but we're letting you in the picture.Ed, I can't help you with the girls if you keep showing up places dressed like the Cookie Crisp guy. Okay? Dude, don't look now but I think Muffy Campanella is scopin' you hard.Smile, pud.My bad.Who's that stone cold fox? Oh, it's my girlfriend. I'm glad you're here, Scar. This whole scout thing's got me wicked nervous.Way you shoot that might be mid- season! Everything cool?Excellent. Gotta run.What's wrong?Scar! Wait.Today is going to be a good day. I love my job. I am a lucky man. Who's lucky? Mike O'Donnell.What are you doing now?Then why are you letting her stick needles in you?I better be. I've invested 18 years of my life in that miserable company.A winner doesn't have to crash at his best friend's house because he was kicked out of his own house.Thanks, Wendy. That like totally means so much to me.How could you do this to me? I've been a salesman here 18 years. Wendy's only been here 2 months!?You can give me the promotion, Roger!Alex?3, 2, 1-The kid's still got it.Ooooh. That was stupid.I do. Me. I'm in the center there.What are you talking about? (lost in the pictureThat'll be my epitaph.Why's it have to be that way?How did you know...Hey, Guys. I was just talking to-Never mind. Sorry I'm late. You ready to get some dinner then?Tweaked my back pumping iron. Really, really heavy iron.I bet your chompin' at the bit for hoop season to start.That's my boy. Remember, it's not how big you are-And what about you, Mags? What's new?You did!? That's fantastic!It's a huge deal. That's a great university. I'm proud of you. Am I missing something here?Try me.That's not stress. Wait `til you get out into the real world, get a crappy job, have some smarmy twerp- boss calling you bro-ski...Still waiting to hear.Is your mom home?Hey, next week we'll have a barbecue at Uncle Ed's. Sound good?What's with her?Bite me, Dom.A little late for a delivery isn't it?Doesn't he live 30 miles from here?Come on. He's been after you since 10th grade and he's after you now.`In touch with the ground, I'm on the hunt I'm after you.'`Smell like I sound, I'm lost in a crowd, and I'm hungry like the wolf.'`Mouth is alive, with juices like wine, and I'm hungry like the wolf'Why are you destroying the yard?Kind of a big undertaking isn't it?I didn't get it.That's a great idea, Scar. Because there are so many options out there for a 36 year old with only a high school diploma.I didn't say that.But I did.Jesus!Hey!? Get away from there!?Oh no!! Hello!?What the-Damn it. Ed! Ed! I lost my key!I've had a really rough night.What are you gonna do? Exfoliate me to death? You got into my samples case again, didn't you?What's your problem, it's only mud.AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!I'm dreaming right? Is this some kind of hallucination?Do something! Anything! Pinch me!I said pinch!Calm down! We need to talk! We can work this out!Well, it obviously isn't working.Is that true?Wait!! Wait!! Wait!! Do you really think this'll work?The janitor!Has anyone seen the janitor? Is the janitor here? Where's the janitor?Excuse me! Excuse me!? Can you tell me where I can find the night janitor?There was an old guy, white hair. I showed him this picture of me-Right. Forget it.Alex? What are you doing up there?Okay. Okay. I'll get you down.I'm...Mark...Freedman. Your Uncle Ed's son. He told me to look out for you.Believe me, it's gonna be a surprise to him too. Did those guys do this to you?But why?But you're one of them.He doesn't exist. Nothing makes sense.No?...I'm going back to high school.Going back to high school.My son was hanging by his underwear from a bathroom stall door and my daughter was being mauled by a smarmy gorilla. They need me.Email and telephone. I got it covered.Nothing.To be honest, I think she'd rather have it that way. What's with the attitude?Take a deep breath. All you have to do is enroll me and say as little as possible.Are you sure these look legit?This is hip teenage apparel. I got it right off the mannequin at Ed Hardy.Nice to meet you, Julie.Dad met mom in Thailand. She's a very successful prostitute.Oh, dad, the doctor called. You were right. It is herpes.Do their mothers know they dress like that?Enough!Do you think humiliating a 17 year- old in front of her peers is helpful or do you just get off on it?Mark Freedman. It's my first day.Is someone barbecuing? YYYYEEEEOOOOOWWWWWWW!!!!Hi, Maggie. Hi, girls. I'm Mark-Girls? Hello? Anyone home?Good. So there's plenty of room then.What's a NIP?Maggie, why are you friends with these horrible girls?You have a boyfriend? Excuse me a second.Maggie, could we talk somewhere ELSE-We should do this again sometime.Get your hands off her, you little punk!No, no, I don't.It was terrible. The place is evil, Ed. That building needs to be exorcised.My beanbag was lit on fire, videoed and sent to every member of student body.They mocked my clothes and phone. My daughter got a tongue bath in front of me and I have mint chip in my ears.Double scotch neat.I'm not going back there.I know why you're encouraging me all of a sudden.Because you want to nail my principal.She's not your type. She's smart.I can't do it. I don't have it in me.You're right! My kids need me.There must be a very hot girl downstairs.I forwarded my calls to my new phone, sent some work emails and just lobbed one to Scarlet, told her I was in Peru finding myself. Think she'll buy it?I am so ready.So I've been here a couple days now and I think I got it figured out. You girls are lesbians, right?Mind if I sit here?I got rid of the bull's eye on my forehead.Who's she?Have you spoken to her?I'll tell you a funny story. The first time I met your mother I was so nervous-What?I did? That's weird. Is your mom hot?What's going on tonight? You wanna hang out? Do something?Yeah you could show me around.I'll swing by your house around 7.Don't worry. I'll see you tonight.Did you girls catch Ellen yesterday? Rosie was on. Melissa Etheridge jammed-I know. I'll text you...NOT. Later...much.Stan. Did mommy sew that on there so you wouldn't forget your name?You know, Stan, I feel sorry for you.Oh but I do. All too well. You're the man. Captain of the basketball team. Dates the pretty girls. High school is your kingdom.But, People, Stan's a bully. Why? It would be way too easy to say Stan preys on the weak because he's simply a dick. No, Stan's more complex than that. According to leading psychiatrists Stan is a bully for 1 of 3 reasons. 1, under all that male bravado there's an insecure little girl banging on the closet door trying to get out. 2, like a caveman, Stan's brain is underdeveloped. Therefore Stan is unable to use self-control so he acts out aggressively. And the third reason-I'd argue that Stan suffers from all 3.Don't hurt yourself big boy.3, 2, 1...My guidance councilor made me come, but just so you know I'm not planning on going to college.Thanks.It was incredible! I was incredible! You should'a seen me! I humiliated Stan in front of the entire lunchroom. Everyone was clapping. The popular girls were begging to give me their numbers!Man, I feel great! I even shot some hoops after school. No aches. No pains. Gotta run, Buddy.Is something wrong?That's my dad. All 68 inches of him.My mother...she...she was...a...-a convict. In New Jersey. They met while dad was at Princeton. She was on parole. B&E, fist fighting, shanking. Nothing major. But she's dead now.I warned her about kite surfing during hurricane season. So how are things with you? Doing anything exciting? Dating? Flirting with Dom Johnson maybe?I mean do what you want. You're a grown woman but, word on the street is Dom's been spreading gingivitis all over town.You doing some gardening?I almost don't even recognize it...er...if I had seen it before I probably wouldn't recognize it.It seems like a lot'a work for one person, Scar.Good luck with the project.How's your mom doing? You know, with your dad not being around and all.I have no idea what this says?Let's hit the beach, wingman.What are you so nervous about?What are you talking about? You're a basketball player. You're cool.But I thought you were getting ready for the season?Who?Calm down. Here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna go over there and introduce yourself-Why? Because Stan says so? You think Stan's a winner? He's going nowhere. You're a great kid. Any girl would be lucky to get your attention.Really. And right now, there's a girl over there who's dying to meet you.Just introduce yourself. Then compliment her on something she never gets complimented on. Like if she has big, meaty, man hands tell her she should be a hand model. And don't burp on her.Stan. Why are you dating him?I'm serious. He's not a nice guy. Matter of fact he's a jackass.I know he bullies your brother.Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I thought you were going to Georgetown?The hell you are, Young Lady! If you think I'm gonna let you throw your life away on some Sleestack you're crazy! I forbid you to see him anymore and that's final!Don't you walk away from me, Margaret Sarah O'Donnell!What's going on?What was that all about?I don't know what you're talking about?You went through my room!?I have to face the possibility that I might never turn back and if that's the case, I'm going to do it right this time around.Who?Leave her alone, Stan. She's a good kid.This year you're making the team. We practice everyday `til try outs. That gives us a week and a half.Yeah, you're right. You probably don't have any skills anyway.So what's your problem? Is it Stan and his friends?You don't need to be afraid of them, Alex.That's why we focus on your speed, dribbling and outside shot. Remember, it's not how big you are-I don't know? Read it somewhere I guess. Be a sport. Show me what you got.Alright. You got a little game.Let's go, Alex.We'll save you the embarrassment for try-outs.Back off, Stan.Act like you're hurt and she won't be able to stay mad at you.Not anymore. You smell great.No.Yeah, but I just had a manicure.Are you kidding? I love landscaping!It's right up there with watching \"Sex and the City\" and snuggling.I'm just doing this to make a few bucks so I can buy Laker tickets.Wow. 10 whole dollars. At that rate I should be able to buy tickets in...2011.What are the benefits like here?Deal.Maggie?You lost me?What happened? What did he do? You didn't...Your next word better be `cookies' or you're in big, big trouble!Maggie, did you two...you know...do...That thing...that rabbits do a lot of and that a girl your age should never do and should only do when she's married.There, there now. It's okay.When you're young everything seems like the end of the world. But it's not. It's just the beginning. And you might have to meet a few more jerks, but one day you'll meet a boy who treats you the way you deserve to be treated...like the sun rises and sets with you.I know so.You killed it out there!I got'a use the bathroom.I'm sorry. You just look so beautiful.Can I zip you up?Your jeans?Stupid, idiot, stupid.Maggie, what...Maggie, listen to me. I'm not the person you think...That's right! I'm not like the others. I'm very different than the others. So different that you and I can never be...Yes! Yes! That's it. I'm confused. Extremely confused.What? No-no-no-no. I'm not gay. I'm...I've been in love with the same girl since I was 17.No, you don't. Now- -if you don't mind?Who you texting?Me? No. Yes. It's Ed. I mean dad. Not your dad. My dad. I'll just call him back.You hung the lights!It's amazing. I'm speechless. I'm sorry I never saw how talented you are...I mean when people see this and how talented you are you'll be designing sanctuaries all over the city.Let's see who the lucky guy is.I knew it!I knew you had a thing for him! You can't do this! You took vows. What kind of example are you setting for the kids!?Keep it in your pants, Casanova.Don't you lay a finger on her, Johnson! I know where you live!It's adultery! If this were Afghanistan she'd be dragged through the village by goats. You need to talk to her.Maybe he's not? Maybe he wishes he could be here right now with you but there's a real good reason he can't be.Then why would you tell him that?My wife's moving on. My son doesn't think I like him and my daughter's in love with me. I need to change back, Ed.I'm not going. I'll be a pharm rep til I die. I just want my family back. You're not gonna wear that, are you?Fine. I want to have some kids over tonight to celebrate Alex making the team. Is that cool?Listen to you. You sound like an old man.Don't treat me like a child, Ed.Not even close...Dad!Give me that!I'm so sorry. Have you seen Alex?I thought you girls wanted to dance?Party's over, Stan. You're out of here.I would but it smells like you've been drinking so I'll let the cops do it.On second thought-I had the craziest dream. I was 17 again and back in high school. It was horrible, Scarlet-Wait! This is highly inappropriate and dysfunctional. Listen to me, Maggie. I'm your father.Blew what? What happened?Slow down. Have you ever kissed a girl before?How did you find...forget it. It's easy. All you have to do is take her face in your hands gently like THIS--hold her still as you adjust your head, close your eyes and kiss her. The rest happens naturally.If you feel it, you know, getting angry, take a step back. Now go get that kiss.Girls, if I was 20 years younger I'd...probably only last 10 seconds anyway. Put your clothes back on.I'm so dead.Oh no!Scarlet, what are you doing here?Yeah, he's fine. He's with his girlfriend.He does and she's really cute. Come on.Believe me, I do. He's a great kid. And you're an amazing mother.Hey, you didn't run him off. Don't blame yourself for his stupidity.That's bull shit! You, Maggie and Alex are the best thing that ever happened to me...him. He was just too selfish to recognize it. At least, that's how I see it.Scar, just calm down. I have something to tell you but I need you to keep an open mind. Can you do that for me?I'm not Mark.It's no game. I'm me...him...Mike. It's me...your husband.It's the truth. I'm the father of your children. You have to believe me.Let me explain, Scar.Alex, wait. Let me explain-She hates me, Ed. I've ruined everything.I really messed up. I've lost my family.What about you and Julie?Sorry about the party. I'll pay for any damages.I don't know. We just need to stop her from going through with it!Your Honor! I have a letter from Mike O'Donnell. Just let me read it. Please.Thank you, your Honor. September 7th, 1988 was the first time I saw you. You were reading `The Great Gatsby' and wearing a Guns N Roses T-shirt. I'd never seen anything so perfect. I remember thinking I had to have you or I'd die...not in a psycho kinda way but in that beautiful, innocent, unaffected way that way only a 17 year-old kid can have. You whispered you loved me at the homecoming dance and I felt so peaceful and safe because I knew no matter what happened from that night on nothing could ever be that bad because I had you. And then I grew up, lost my way and blamed you for my failures. But I was never lost. I'd just forgotten the way life makes you forget as you grow older. And I never failed at anything because on that September day you said `yes' to me. And at that dance you said you loved me. And as I stand here...as I write this, I want you to know if I don't have you I'll die...not in a psycho way but in that beautiful, innocent, unaffected way only a 17 year old kid can have....oh and...P.S...I'm `Hungry Like the Wolf'.What are you talking about?Enough with the magic crap, Ed.I'm moving on. See you at the game.Just warming up, Coach.That's the plan, Coach.ALEX-I never meant to hurt you-Alex, I'm your fa...I don't know. I'm sorry.It's your turn now. Good luck.Scar!The best choice I ever made was you.Don't ask.I think it's best if we don't tell the kids about this.

I was locked in a life and death battle with the dark wizard...For real?Do you really think Muffy's in to me?I'm not sure if its my Qi or internal bleeding.There he is. There's Mr. Sunshine. Fei Jing Acupuncture. It's all the rage. Makes you look five years younger.What's this brown stuff again?Delish! The girl has absolutely no clue what she's doing.Because she's hot. But today's not about me. It's about you becoming the new regional sales manager.No negativity. Negativity's for the 800 pound fat lady who needs to be airlifted out of bed. You, Michael Shawn O'Donnell, are a winner.Are you kidding?! It doesn't get any better than this!I gotta get back. My legs just went numb. Good luck today.Coming! I've been worried sick! WHERE-AAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!Don't come any closer! I'll use it!Maria, we're just friends. Really.My theory is that you were transformed by a freak congruence of some of the planets most volatile elements. I've recreated the exact contents of the LA River. The toxic pollutants, the contaminants.That's because the cocktail's not complete.Last night we had the worst electrical storm of the last hundred years.It was pretty bad.It could.Oops. Came unplugged. Won't be a moment.What were you doing by the river anyway?Did you find the janitor?Did he ask you for your soul?That's a good sign. We can eliminate Satan. I think what we're dealing with here is a spell of enlightenment. \"Spell affect\"...\"casting procedure\"...yada, yada, yada. Basically it's a learning spell. There's something you need to figure out and until you do you'll stay a kid. My guess is that janitor was probably a war......lock. I'm sorry. Could you repeat that? Because I thought you just said you were-Are you out of your freaking mind!?What about your job?Well, Scarlet, then. What are you gonna tell her?You're just gonna disappear?Because I know you're going to suck me into this and I'm not going back there, Mike. You'll never get me to go back to Fitch. Never!I hate you.Please. I created software used to launch the space shuttle. I think I'm capable of forging some report cards. What's up with the gear?First sign this old hag is on to us I'M--so glad we chose this school. I'm Ed Freedman.Oh, right. Sorry. This little chicken pock here is Mark. Say hello, Mark.Before we get started I want you to know that Mark's a bastard.I had him out of wedlock. So the answer is yes, I'm very single...and very rich.I help him with his homework...a lot.Be a good boy now. And sit up straight.They grow up so fast. Mojito?You strike me as a Mojito gal. I know this little Cuban place, great PLANTAINS-I'll enroll him somewhere else.See you at the next bake sale then?Come on. It couldn't have been that bad.Yeah, I caught it on youtube. Funny stuff.High school's great, isn't it?Get the boy a Shirley Temple. Extra cherries.Mike, you're an adult sitting on 36 years of experience. You should be dominating these kids, ripping their hearts out.Because I'm a supportive dad.Did she ask about me?As far as I can tell that's her only flaw. I need a reason to see her again. You could flunk your classes, start a fight, vandalise the place. You'll figure it out. Then I can rush in, a teary eyed, helpless, single dad who can't handle his angry, kitten killing son. What do you think?Mind your business, Lady. This is a family matter.Hey, no sweat off my sack. Tell Alex to stop wearing underwear all together. He'll be fine. That's what I did.At'a boy. Now what you need is a crash course on being a teen inBefore you ask, it's a seaweed wrap. I'm detoxifying as well as losing an inch or 2 from my problem areas.There is. What are you doing?Probably not because when she called earlier I told her you were being detained at Guantanamo. Ready for tomorrow?That ought'a put you over the top. And don't forget to hook me up son.See what happens when you put a little lipstick on the pig? Did you manage to get sent to the principal's office?He cares.That envelope contains divorce papers.But what do you care? You're going to college, right? Life's one big panty raid for you.I saw the applications in your room.If you'd cleaned like I asked I wouldn't have had to. You can't be serious about this can you?Karmically speaking, in the next life you're coming back as a hemorrhoid.I'm not paying for college!Way to go, slugger! Get any shots in?Wuss!Hey, Alex. How you doin', buddy?Good. Good. (turns to Mike, nudgesHey, Scarlet. Exciting, isn't it? My first parent/principal conference.I sent them to him.I haven't heard from him, really.I'll tell him. I promise.I'll take it from here.I'm heartbroken. The boy's incorrigible.My son? Mark! Get in here! Now!Did you glue a boy to his chair?See? The boy's out of control. He's acting up at home. He won't eat his vegetables-He's crying out for help and I don't know what to do. It hurts so bad. Maybe we could discuss this over margaritas?You're the expert. I'm just a single dad out here blowing like dust in the wind.What about college?Baby's got back.Wrap it up. No, it's not cool. I remember hearing what those parties were like, kids peeing everywhere, food on the ceilings, puke in the pool.No party. I mean it. Don't make me take the car away.I won't when you stop acting like one.This isn't over...son!Thanks. Put this towards your studies.Are you insinuating that I'd use my son's misfortune just to go out with you? What kind of a father do you think I am?Bring us the 1962 Petrus.You're going to love this wine. $2000 dollars a bottle.It's baffling really but I noticed he's been drinking a lot of diet ice tea lately. Maybe he's gay?Do you like caviar? Because if you do you have to try the Almas. 100 year-old Beluga. $700 per ounce.What? You don't like Beluga? You can get something else.Would the caviar and expensive wine impress you if you were on a yacht off Monte Carlo?I do care about Mike...Mark. Whatever his name is.Wait. You're right. I'm acting like an idiot. I'm sorry. Please stay.God's honest truth. I had the whole costume. I used to go everywhere dressed like a wizard. No wonder I didn't get a date all through high school. Annnnd you think I'm the biggest nerd ever.Tis I. The Wizard they call Marius. And who might you be fair maiden?Check please!I have two words for you. Russian mafia.That little-! I'll kill him!Everybody out! Get out! Get out!Do you know where Mark Freedman is?This place is a disaster! A kid pissed all over my English garden! What were you thinking!?Oh boy. I don't quite know how to put this.He's not really my son. I don't have a son.Should I call you?!Come on. It's been 2 days. Open up.Jesus. It smells like Jeffrey Dahmer's kitchen in here.Are you alright?That's not true. Nothing's ever truly lost.Oh, that? That's lost.Don't worry about it. My spa guy got the last of the vomit out of the pool so we're good. I don't mean to rub salt in your wounds but--you're due in court in an hour.What exactly are we doing?A well thought out plan. Good job.I declare a mistrial on the grounds of insufficient evidence and Sacco and Vanzetti!I am legal counsel for Mike O'Donnell and I demand a stay of execution for this marriage, your Majesty.No but I have been a defendant in numerous lawsuits so-Maybe it wasn't a spell of enlightenment.According to the website once you've learned your lesson you'd turn back.

Everything's totally copacetic.Dom was in the neighborhood. He offered to make a dump run for me.What's your point?At least someone's after me.Please, Mike. This isn't high school. That's not gonna work.You can stop now. It's not working.You no longer have the right to invoke the \"wolf.\"I'm gonna use it as a showpiece for clients. Thanks for asking.I am a landscape designer. Then again you barely took an interest in my work so I guess that's a fair question.I'm sorry. But maybe this is what you needed. Maybe it's time you looked for something else?And it's all my fault, isn't it?No, but it's what you think, right?I never asked you to marry me.I'm sorry you're not happy with the way your life turned out Mike, really, I am, but you're not the victim here.I've been dying to meet you. I've known your father since...No. It's just...you look like...No. I'm fine. Come in. Please.And you say Ed Freedman is your father?You don't look anything like him. If you don't mind me asking, who's your mother?Oh? I'm sorry.Why would you ask about Dom? Did Ed tell you to say that?I'll keep that in mind, Mark.It's crazy how much you like my husband when he was a teenager.I am. I'm a landscape designer. I'm actually redoing the backyard. I'll show you.It's a work in progress so you'll have to use your imagination some.You wouldn't have. It was a disaster back here a few days ago. Obviously I have a lot to do still. I'm laying the sod next and the limestone pathway will go here.Then I'll plant all those, over a hundred different types of flowers and plants. I have an amazing fountain being delivered that'll go here and a bench over there.And I'll string rows of tiny, white lights above it all so every night will be a starry one. It'll be a real sanctuary back here.My husband's the only one that ever calls me that.Nice to meet you. And, Alex, be home by 10:30.I haven't heard from him in three weeks. Obviously he doesn't care.Then where is he?Nothing, Mark. I was just dropping something off.Our court date is the 27th. If he has anything to say, he can say it then.Ed.Fighting? What's gotten into you?My poor baby. And how about you, Mark?Ouch. You poor thing. Does it hurt?Alex, I'll meet you at the car. I need to talk to Uncle Ed for a second.Did you give him the divorce papers?Is it another woman? I can handle it. Tell me the truth.Okay. If you do, please have him call home. For the kids...I'm running out of excuses-Gloves are for sissies.You're serious? You want to help?Mark, I'm 36 years old-Embarrassing. Sorry. I'll give you 10 dollars a day.Fine. 20. Grab a roll.I'll throw in a baloney sandwich.Mark? I didn't know you were there.Thank you.I'm wearing a sweater.So? What happened? Tell me. Tell me. I'm dying to hear.Oh my God, Alex! That's so incredible!I'm so happy for you. And now I want to show you guys something.Ta da!I wanted you to be the first to see it.Thank you.Oh my God. I almost forgot. I have a date.Mark, I'm flattered. Really, I am. But I'm too old for you.Don't mind him. You all set?I'm looking for Alex. It's past his curfew and he wasn't picking up his phone. Is he here?Alex has a girlfriend?He's like a totally different person.It's been so good for him to have you around. You have no idea.I'm not so sure. I mean look at me. I showed up at a party to drag my son home. Could I be any more embarrassing? And how many amazing mothers run their kids' father off?I knew he was unhappy. I knew he hated his job. I should've been more supportive, more sympathetic to what he was going through. He gave up a lot for me.You're sweet. I have no idea why I'm telling you all this. There's just something so familiar...What do you think you're doing!?This conversation is over, Mark.I'm not in the mood for games.What? Why would you say that?Don't ever come near me or my family again. If you do, I'll have you arrested or better yet, institutionalized.Your son needs a shrink!I do.Yes, your Honor.No, your Honor.He's my husband's best friend.If it's okay, your Honor. I'd like to hear it.Your Honor, Sir. I'm sorry.
