{"AfterLife": {"PAUL": {"raw_line": "What's wrong?...it's like fucking a corpse. Paul immediately realizes he's gone too far. Turns to Anna.Shit. I'm sorry. That was-- Anna gets out of bed. Walks towards the bathroom. Paul puts his head in his hands.Anna. I'm sorry. That was a stupid thing to say. But you know sometimes... sometimes it's like you're not here anymore. Like you're somewhere else.Is this about us?Then what is it?I just want us to be happy. Anna doesn't move. We sense the emptiness inside her.Are you happy? She closes her eyes. Forces herself to reply.OK. Who took the last pepperoni? A PREPPY GUY slides across another pizza box.Great. Broccoli. Who the fuck ordered broccoli? NEAL, a thin pallid guy, looks up.Yeah. With wheatgrass and alfalfa sprouts. Everyone laughs.Hi baby. I'm really sorry about this morning. I fucked up. I know.Please Anna. It took me weeks to get the table.No. It has to be tonight.Nothing. Don't worry. I just need... I just want us to have dinner tonight.And Anna. Everything's going to be fine.I promise.You scared the life out of me. Anna laughs as she sits down. Paul looks up at her.Your hair.I didn't say that. It's just very... red. I mean it's not really you is it? A WAITER appears at the table before Anna can reply.Yes. We'll have the duck.What? You always have the duck here.The duck is very good. Anna's smile broadens. The tension between them broken for the moment. Paul reaches across. Touches her hand.Let's not argue tonight. OK?Actually there is something I need to talk to you about. Now Anna's nervous.I've been offered a transfer to head office in Chicago. Anna looks down. Stares at her hands on the table.It'll mean more work of course. More responsibility. A lot of changes. But it's an incredible opportunity. I'd be crazy to turn it down. And...Anna wait.Anna.Keep your voice down, everyone's watching.You're crazy. You know that? Just like your mother.Anna. Open the door. Please. I want you to come with me. I want to...Anna! Still no answer. Paul looks around. Notices the driveway's empty. He heads back to his car.Oh hi. I'm looking for Anna Bryant. The Teacher quickly moves over. Hustles Paul to the door.I'm Anna's... fianc\u00e9e. Paul Conran. I thought this was her class. The Teacher glances suspiciously at the flowers in his hand.We had a little misunderstanding last night.Did she call in sick?Mrs. Bryant. Beatrice doesn't acknowledge him. Paul turns to Diane.Hi Diane. I need to talk to Anna. Diane can't look him in the eye.What's wrong?What happened? Where's Anna?A car crash? When? Beatrice turns her wheelchair round to face Paul.But... we were at the restaurant... Beatrice glares at him. She clearly blames him for Anna's death.No. She can't be dead. There must be some mistake.Why didn't you call me?Mr. Deane?My name's Conran. Paul Conran. Eliot smiles. Holds out his hand.I'm Anna Bryant's fianc\u00e9e.Well not quite fianc\u00e9e...I'd like to see her.I'd need to see her now. If that's possible.Please. It'd only take a minute.I tried to stop her. She didn't hear me. Paul's voice breaks with emotion. He can't go on. Eliot gently takes him by the elbow. Leads him back to his car.Is Tom in?Thanks. I'll just go and grab a coffee. As Paul walks away, the Officer returns to the phone.Come on. He pushes the button repeatedly. Then angrily slams the side of the machine. Nothing.You piece of shit. As Paul turns away, he notices a door with a sign on it: AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY. Paul glances around. Then quickly walks over to the door.I need to see Anna.The funeral director won't let me see her Tom. He says I'm not family. Can you talk to him? Put some pressure on him.Tom. You're my friend.I fucked up.I always fuck everything up.Leave me alone.Bad dream?Yes? Anna looks up. Paul's in the doorway. She gets up. Suddenly the light goes off.Ssh. Don't talk so loud. You'll wake the neighbors.Did you ever love me Anna? CLOSE ON Anna's face. She looks away guiltily.Did you? Anna closes her eyes. Unable to answer.Say it. Say you love me. Suddenly we hear the strident ringing of a phone.Me? No. It's probably for Eliot. Anna's eyes snap open in shock...Thank you.Look... Jack. I'm in no mood--I can't help her anymore. Paul turns and walks away. Jack grabs his arm.You little fuck. You think this is funny? He's about to hit Jack again when a STOCKY TEACHER grabs him. Paul tries to struggle loose.Jack... I'm sorry...Am I?You know what he told me? He told me Anna's alive.No. Of course not. Tom's relieved. Paul turns back to the monitors. The ghostly figure of a YOUNG FEMALE TEACHER drifts hypnotically across the screen.It's just... I'm having these...Nothing. Forget it.Deane. Eliot turns. Paul's clearly agitated.She's not dead is she?Someone saw her.One of Anna's students. In the window.You know him?I don't think he imagined it. I think he really saw her.Fuck you. Paul pushes past Eliot and strides into the Funeral Home.What's down there?She's in here isn't she? Give me the key. Eliot stares at Paul with pity.Give me the fucking key. Paul turns back. POUNDS the door in rage.Anna!I'm here Anna.We'll be happy again. I promise.I can't live without you. Eliot looks up at Paul with sudden interest.Anna! Eliot gently puts his hand on Paul's shoulder.She needs my help. Eliot looks at him for a moment.I need you to issue a search warrant. Tom looks up. He's shocked by Paul's appearance.Anna's not dead Tom. He won't let me see her. He's keeping her there--She's not dead. Tom calmly gets up. Moves to a filing cabinet. Takes out a file. Hands it to Paul.Look. The paramedics phoned it in. They only checked for eye dilation and pulse. The doctor signed the death certificate without even seeing her body.There was no EEG. Nothing. He could have drugged her to make it look like she was dead.See? I'm telling you. She's not dead. The boy at school. Jack. He saw her.No!Tom. Just go down there and check the place out.No. But--I think she called me.Maybe you're right. But why won't he let me see her? Tom signals to Merano and Jeff. Merano walks back to his desk. Jeff turns back to his work.She's so cold. Paul turns back to Anna. Tears prick his eyes. He touches her cheek again. Finally accepting her death.I'm sorry Anna. He kisses her lips. Eliot watches him carefully. It's almost as if he's jealous. Jack notices Eliot's look then turns and stares at Paul. As Paul and Tom walk away Eliot closes the casket. Begins to screw down the lid.Yeah. Thanks Tom. Tom squeezes Paul's shoulder then walks away.You said she was alive.You need a ride? Jack shakes his head.OK. See you. Paul opens the car door.Go to hell. An ELDERLY COUPLE shake their heads and walk away.I know she wasn't dead.Come on. Come on. He swerves into the middle of the road. There's a blind curve ahead... suddenly an SUV comes out of the corner. A bright white light sweeps through his car. Paul's momentarily blinded.Anna. I'm here. Please God. Anna. He desperately tries to revive her. But there's no life left in her. He's about to give up when... Anna's hand TWITCHES. Then after a moment she GASPS. Her eyes slowly focus on Paul.Baby. Thank God. Paul gently helps Anna to her feet. She looks round. Dazed. Turns back to Paul.I came back for you. You're safe now.Anna? Paul looks round desperately. Runs between the stone crosses and statues of grieving angels searching for her.Anna! Just then he glimpses SOMETHING MOVE among the trees. Runs over. Nothing. The cemetery is empty. The trees appear to SHIMMER for a moment. Paul shivers. Pulls his jacket around him. He doesn't notice the candles on Anna's grave behind him suddenly BLOW OUT.Anna! Suddenly the interior light in his car comes on. Paul looks at the car nervously. He heads over to it. Apprehensive. Then... the car door slowly CLICKS open. Paul stops. Stares into the car. There's no one there.Where did you go? Anna puts her fingers on Paul's lips. Clearly turned on. We hear the sound of something being UNZIPPED.Scissors? What scissors?Where am I?I'm not dead. Jack appears at Eliot's side.I saw Anna. You buried her alive.I'm not dead. Eliot speaks calmly. Soothingly.I'm not dead. Eliot sighs wearily. He's had this conversation many times before.I'm not dead.", "clean_line": "wrong like fucking corpse paul immediately realizes gone far turns anna shit sorry anna gets bed walks bathroom paul puts head hands anna sorry stupid thing know like anymore like want happy anna sense emptiness inside happy closes eyes forces reply ok took pepperoni preppy guy slides pizza box great broccoli fuck ordered broccoli neal pallid guy looks yeah wheatgrass alfalfa sprouts laughs hi baby sorry morning fucked know anna took weeks table tonight worry need want dinner tonight anna going fine promise scared life anna laughs sits paul looks hair red mean waiter appears table anna reply yes ll duck duck duck good anna smile broadens tension broken moment paul reaches touches hand let argue tonight ok actually need talk anna nervous ve offered transfer head office chicago anna looks stares hands table ll mean work course responsibility lot changes incredible opportunity crazy turn anna wait anna voice watching crazy know like mother anna open door want come want anna answer paul looks notices driveway heads car oh hi looking anna bryant teacher quickly moves hustles paul door anna fianc\u00e9e paul conran thought class teacher glances suspiciously flowers hand little misunderstanding night sick mrs bryant beatrice acknowledge paul turns diane hi diane need talk anna diane look eye wrong happened anna car crash beatrice turns wheelchair round face paul restaurant beatrice glares clearly blames anna death dead mistake mr deane conran paul conran eliot smiles holds hand anna bryant fianc\u00e9e fianc\u00e9e like need possible minute tried stop hear paul voice breaks emotion eliot gently takes elbow leads car tom thanks ll grab coffee paul walks away officer returns phone come pushes button repeatedly angrily slams machine piece shit paul turns away notices door sign authorized personnel paul glances quickly walks door need anna funeral director won let tom says family talk pressure tom friend fucked fuck leave bad dream yes anna looks paul doorway gets suddenly light goes ssh talk loud ll wake neighbors love anna close anna face looks away guiltily anna closes eyes unable answer love suddenly hear strident ringing phone probably eliot anna eyes snap open shock thank look jack mood help anymore paul turns walks away jack grabs arm little fuck think funny hit jack stocky teacher grabs paul tries struggle loose jack sorry know told told anna alive course tom relieved paul turns monitors ghostly figure young female teacher drifts hypnotically screen having forget deane eliot turns paul clearly agitated dead saw anna students window know think imagined think saw fuck paul pushes past eliot strides funeral home isn key eliot stares paul pity fucking key paul turns pounds door rage anna anna ll happy promise live eliot looks paul sudden anna eliot gently puts hand paul shoulder needs help eliot looks moment need issue search warrant tom looks shocked paul appearance anna dead tom won let keeping dead tom calmly gets moves filing cabinet takes file hands paul look paramedics phoned checked eye dilation pulse doctor signed death certificate seeing body eeg drugged look like dead telling dead boy school jack saw tom check place think called maybe right won let tom signals merano jeff merano walks desk jeff turns work cold paul turns anna tears prick eyes touches cheek finally accepting death sorry anna kisses lips eliot watches carefully jealous jack notices eliot look turns stares paul paul tom walk away eliot closes casket begins screw lid yeah thanks tom tom squeezes paul shoulder walks away said alive need ride jack shakes head ok paul opens car door hell elderly couple shake heads walk away know wasn dead come come swerves middle road blind curve ahead suddenly suv comes corner bright white light sweeps car paul momentarily blinded anna god anna desperately tries revive life left anna hand twitches moment gasps eyes slowly focus paul baby thank god paul gently helps anna feet looks round dazed turns paul came safe anna paul looks round desperately runs stone crosses statues grieving angels searching anna glimpses trees runs cemetery trees appear shimmer moment paul shivers pulls jacket notice candles anna grave suddenly blow anna suddenly interior light car comes paul looks car nervously heads apprehensive car door slowly clicks open paul stops stares car anna puts fingers paul lips clearly turned hear sound unzipped scissors scissors dead jack appears eliot saw anna buried alive dead eliot speaks calmly soothingly dead eliot sighs wearily conversation times dead"}, "ANNA": {"raw_line": "Nothing. Anna leans down and picks up her RED SLIP from the floor.It's not about us.I don't know.I'm happy.What's going on? She glances at the Older Boys then at Jack.Jack?Nothing? The incubator didn't just fall by itself. The Older Boys stare at Jack. Waiting for his reaction.Show's over. Get to your classes.No. The poor thing's just scared.I don't know Paul.Is someone there?Jack!It's locked. He gently pushes against the door. The door slowly opens.Shouldn't you be home?I didn't know the park was open yet.Sounds like fun.Jack. Those boys. Do they bother you a lot? Jack hesitates. Then slowly nods his head.You know you can always talk to me about it if you want to. He nods. Anna's clearly worried about him.You sure you don't need a ride? Jack shakes his head. Anna glances at her watch.Well. I better run.No Jack. Funerals are very private affairs.It wouldn't be appropriate Jack. Anyway wouldn't your mom worry about you?I'm sure she would. I'll see you tomorrow in class. Have a wonderful birthday. Jack nods disappointed. Anna watches him walk away then gets in her car.Yes Mother.Can I get you something to eat?You have to eat.The doctor said--What have I done wrong this time? Anna goes to the window. Draws back the curtains.No I haven't forgotten. The service isn't till six.It's permanent. You can't wash it out.I don't look--To do the washing up.I changed them Monday. Anna goes to the cupboard. Takes out clean sheets.Nothing is going to happen to you.That's enough Mother! Anna dumps the sheets on the bed. As she turns to leave Beatrice's hand darts out and grabs Anna's wrist.Mrs. Hutton. I'm so sorry.Fine. She sends her condolences.No. I'm fine. Everything's fine. But we can see in her eyes that everything's not fine. Mrs. Hutton nods, then turns to greet another MOURNER. Anna steps nervously up to the coffin.Sorry about that. Paul dabs the stain with a napkin.You don't like it.Paul.I don't always have the duck. Paul shrugs. Pours Anna some wine as she looks through the menu. The Waiter taps his pen on his pad impatiently. Anna sighs. Puts the menu aside.I'll have the duck. Paul smiles as the Waiter leaves. Anna tries to ignore him. But after a second she can't help smiling back.This is good. She picks up the bottle. Checks the label.And looks very expensive...You're going to leave me. Paul's stunned. Speechless. Before he can say anything--You could've just told me this morning. You didn't need to buy me off with an expensive meal. Paul reaches for her hand. Anna gets up to leave.Why did you lie to me? You promised everything was going to be OK.I'm not being ridiculous. Why do you always talk to me like I'm a small child?See? There you go again. Do you know how irritating that is?Fuck you! The other DINERS turn and stare at them. Paul glances at them embarrassed. Anna doesn't notice. Upset.I'm nothing like my mother! Anna grabs her coat. Pushes her way through the restaurant.Good. Paul's suddenly aware that everyone's looking at him. He quickly sits down. Drains his glass of wine. Furious.Shit! Anna swerves into the next lane. We hear the blaring horn from the car behind her.OK. OK. I saw you.Paul? You home yet? Can you pick up? I just don't want it to end like this. Anna drops the phone into her bag on the passenger seat. Wipes away the mist on the inside of the glass. A TRACTOR TRAILER shudders past loaded with metal pipes.Where am I? She talks with difficulty. Her breathe labored.I'm not dead.I'm not dead. Eliot looks at her sadly for a moment. He places the bloodied dress on the trolley. Then picks up a document. Holds it up for her.Who are you? Eliot delicately washes Anna's face. She doesn't flinch as he dabs the wound above her eye brow.Don't touch me! Why are you touching me?I'm not dead. Eliot sighs wearily. As if he'd had this conversation many times before.Paul? You home yet? Can you pick up? I just don't want it to end like this. Paul's relieved. He picks up the phone. Dials. We hear the ringing on the other end.Please don't hurt me.But I'm not dead.Please. Just let me go. I won't go to the police. I won't tell anyone. Eliot moves her head back. Gently wipes away her tear.What are you doing?I must be in shock. That's all. It's just shock. She struggles to her feet. Stumbles groggily to the door. Tries the door handle. It's locked. She bangs on the door feebly. Then she hears something. She cocks her head. Follows the sound of Eliot's footsteps upstairs.Who was that?No one? A long beat.That's none of your business. Eliot shrugs. Dries his hands on a white towel.You weren't going to tell me Paul was here, were you?Why not?I don't believe you. Why are you doing this to me? He shakes his head as he drops the towel into a small bin.No. You drugged me. So my motherYou're crazy! Eliot's taken aback. Hurt.What!? He looks her up and down. Gauging her height.Why..?Wait! He ignores her. The door CLICKS shut behind him.Oh God. Please. I don't want to die.Who is she?Stay where you are.Don't come any closer. I swear to God I'll kill you. Eliot walks right up to her. His face now inches from hers.I'm breathing! Look. I'm still alive!Maybe I was in some kind of coma. The doctors made a mistake. They're always making mistakes.How can I be dead if we're talking? He stands up. Sighs wearily.Why?Is this what happens when you die?What do you mean?Am I a ghost? Is that why I'm here?But I can breathe. I must be alive. She weakly pushes him away. Anger flashes across Eliot's face, but just as quickly he controls it.I have nothing to learn!Are you cold?I'm so cold. Anna notices the Old Woman's plastic ankle tag.You had a long life. Anna turns back. Studies the Old Woman's serene face.You look so peaceful.I'm scared. I'm so scared.Who are you?Is this the afterlife? Am I in heaven? Or am I in hell? Strangely Eliot's not surprised. He nods his head. His anger gone now.The door...I used to believe in God. I thought I'd see him when I died. Instead I saw you. Eliot softly strokes her hair. Comforting her.Paul. She lets out a DESPONDENT SIGH. The SIGH carries into the next scene...What's that?This isn't my dress. This is my mother's dress! It was supposed to be for her funeral. Why has she given it to me? Eliot starts folding the plastic bag. He notices something else inside. He opens the bag. Hesitates then takes something out.It should have been her not me. She was the one dying. Not me. Eliot unlocks the door. Jams it open with a door stop. Slips his keys back into his jacket pocket. Takes off his jacket and hangs it up. He moves over to a collapsible gurney folded on the floor. Bends down and snaps open the side-rails. Anna looks at the open door.I'm not ready to die. Eliot looks up at Anna sadly.Please. It doesn't fit. She's panicking. She fumbles for another key. It almost fits. She forces it. The key SNAPS OFF LOUDLY in the lock.No! Anna looks around desperately. Sees a tray of instruments on the steel trolley. She scrambles over. Finds a pair of surgical pliers. She moves back to the door.Paul. Please pick up.Paul. Suddenly the light comes on.What do you mean?Then prove to me I'm really dead.Why do I look like a corpse?I am dead.I was dead. I had a car accident. Did you ever dream you were dead? Paul doesn't reply. She turns... the bed's empty.Paul?Paul. The light comes back on. Paul stands by the light switch.What are you doing?What neighbors? You don't have any neighbors. Suddenly he looks at her reproachfully.Aren't you going to pick it up?Is it always like this?I thought when you died you wouldn't feel anything. You wouldn't feel any more pain. You wouldn't have to struggle anymore.What's that for? Eliot looks up surprised. Anna stands beside him. He leans down. Peels back Frank's upper lip.Is this how you'll prepare my body? Eliot looks at her for a moment. Smiles reassuringly.Does he have family?My mother... She didn't cry did she? When she came to see me?And Paul?I need to know.I knew he wouldn't. He always got upset when I cried. He said crying never helped. Anna suddenly looks very weary. She leans heavily against the slab. As if she's about to fall.Can I ask you something?Why do we die? A long beat.Your fingernails are dirty. Eliot smiles. Examines his nails.Your hands are normally so clean.Is it sunny outside? Eliot fills a bowl with water. Carries it to the slab.I miss the sun. Anna glances up at the shuttered window. Eliot snaps on his latex gloves. Picks up a sponge and wets it in the bowl of water. Anna turns to the tulips.Are they your favorite flower?I thought it'd be lilies. White lilies. Don't they symbolize death?And tulips? Eliot hesitates for a second before replying.Violets. Eliot softly washes her legs.What do they symbolize?Roses are red, violets are blue... He reaches over to the CD player to switch it off.No. Leave it on. It's so peaceful. Eliot smiles. Leaves the music on.This morning? She talks with difficulty now. Her voice SLURRED and HOARSE. Her words muddled and rambling. Her eyes even more sunken. Her skin even more pale.He'll be all right now? Won't he? Eliot looks away. Doesn't reply. He drapes the dress over his arm, picks up a pair of shiny black shoes and moves over to her.Already?I need to... I have so many regrets. I have nothing but regrets.That's why I'm here isn't it? To be judged. Eliot picks up Anna's shoes. Slips them onto her stiff feet.I wanted a different life. Eliot picks up a nail-clipper. Gently holds Anna's hand as he carefully cuts her long nails.No matter what I did everything just stayed the same. I'd wake up. I'd shower. Sit in the same traffic everyday on my way to work. Go home. Go to sleep. Then wake again. Eliot stops clipping her nails. Irritated.I just wanted to be happy.I don't know. Don't you understand? That's the whole point. I don't know.I don't want to talk about it anymore. I just want this to be over.I don't fucking know!No. You don't understand. I was scared. I wanted to love but I didn't know how. I was...When I was a child. I learnt that love. That when you love someone. You get hurt. So I learned not to love. That way no one could ever hurt me again. She looks down at the slab. Touches the cold marble.I was always pushing Paul away. He thought I didn't love him.He was the only one I ever loved. But I never told him that. And then he stopped loving me. Eliot stares at her intently. Comes to a decision.No.I'm glad I'm dead. I'm glad it's over.I don't even know your name.Can I see myself for the last time? Eliot smiles. Picks up a mirror. Hands it to Anna.Is this the end?You lied to me.You lied to me. Eliot injects her in the side of the neck. Anna tries to raise her hand to push him away but she's too weak.Paul?You came back for me.Promise?Are we going home? Paul turns sharply. Stunned. Anna moves towards him.Or do you want to make love here?I love you. I always did. Anna hungrily kisses him. He responds passionately. Suddenly we hear a SHARP METALLIC SOUND.It's only the scissors... We see the growing anxiety in Paul's eyes. Anna's just interested in his lips.Scissors. For your clothes. Eliot just put them on the table. Paul pulls back. Terrified.You're safe now. We're finally together. A strong bright light sweeps across Paul's face.

Solid cherry. Hand rubbed satin finish. Tufted sovereign interior. Eternal-Rest adjustable mattress with matching pillow. He gestures to a metal casket.Or perhaps the Aegean? Solid bronze exterior. Hand brushed finish with Grecian bronze highlights.Excellent choice. Mrs. Ayres caresses the soft velvet trimming.Mrs. Ayres?It's different every time. Each person dies in their own way.They just seemed appropriate somehow.You're in a funeral home.You had a car accident. It was raining. You hit a truck loaded with metal pipes. She looks fearfully at the bloodied dress in Eliot's hand.You were pronounced dead eight hours ago. Your blood no longer circulates through your body. Your brain cells are slowly dying. Your body's already decomposing.This is your death certificate. Cause of death. Massive internal trauma. Time of death. 8.23PM.You were dead on arrival. The attending physician signed here... ...at 9.45 last night. I picked up your body from the hospital morgue at 12.10 this morning. Anna stares with horror at her death certificate, then at Eliot. He looks away. It pains him to see her so distressed.I'm sorry. Eliot picks up a sponge from the trolley. Wets it.I'm preparing your body. You have to look beautiful for your funeral.You all say the same thing.Then why are you here? Anna doesn't know what to say. She turns her head away. A tear falls down her cheek.You're still in denial. You have to trust me. I'm only here to help you. Eliot slides a wooden head-rest under her neck and studies her wounds, touching them delicately. Thinking about how to conceal them. He turns to a tray of instruments. Picks up a needle. Leans over Anna. The needle pierces her brow. Sliding cleanly through her skin. She doesn't feel any pain as Eliot carefully sews the wound. He's meticulous. Clearly very good at his job. Eliot glances at his watch. Picks up a SYRINGE and an AMPOULE OF AMBER LIQUID. Draws up the amber liquid. Anna's alarmed. She tries to pull back.Don't be scared.This will relax your muscles. Stop the rigor mortis setting in so I can work on your body. He INJECTS Anna in the neck. Just then we hear a car pull up on the gravel driveway outside.I'm so very sorry Mrs. Bryant. It's always so tragic when you lose a child.If you'd care to come to my office we can discuss the arrangements.But she hasn't been--Of course.Ah. Forgive me. Eliot quickly steps forward. Pulls out the needle. Cuts the thread with a pair of large scissors.As I said. I've only just started preparing her.No. The soul never leaves. Beatrice stares at Anna.I'll confirm the date with Father Graham this afternoon. Friday as you requested.Yes?Can I help you? Paul turns to him. Pulled away from his thoughts.Yes.Of course. The lawyer. It's a small town. In my line of work you get to know everyone eventually. As they shake, Eliot looks at Paul's hand strangely. As if he senses something.That's strange. She wasn't wearing an engagement ring.I'm very sorry for your loss Mr. Conran.I'm afraid the viewing isn't until--I'm sorry. It's not possible. You're not family and--I understand. But--Mr. Conran. There really is nothing I can do. I'm so sorry. Paul looks defeated. He simply nods his head. Eliot watches him get into his car and drive away.No one.It was Paul.Did you love him? Anna looks up sharply. Eliot's clearly hit a nerve.No.Because it would only hurt you. You have to let go of the living. Just like they have to let go of you.You're all the same. You all blame me for your death. As if it were my fault.The others. They just see you as a dead body on a slab. Only I can see you as you really are.I'm a busy man. I don't have time for this. He heads to the door. Pulls out his keys and unlocks it. Just then he remembers something. Turns to her.Oh I nearly forgot. How tall are you?Five seven.I need to know how tall you are. For your coffin. Anna's stunned. Eliot looks at her for a moment. Then switches off the main lights.Mrs. Whitehall. He mixes the dye in a bowl as he moves over to Anna.You shouldn't be afraid of her. The dead can't harm the dead.Give me the scissors. I only want to help you.Go on.What are you waiting for? Anna's confidence falters. She slowly lowers her hand. The scissors fall onto the floor. Anna looks down defeated. Her breath labored. Suddenly she realizes...You think you're still alive because you're still attached to life. It's normal. You're just imagining you still have symptoms of life. She's not listening. Eliot takes a roll of paper towels. Kneels down, picks up the bowl of dye and mops up the mess.You died. Everyone dies.We're talking not because you're alive. But because I have a gift.To help them make the transition. Anna's stunned. For the first time we sense a seed of doubt in her mind.It depends on how you lived your life.Not everyone needs my help. Some let go as soon as their body dies. Others don't let go until long after they're in the grave.You're here so I can bury you. Anna's silent. Trying to make sense of what she's just heard. Eliot takes her arm. Leads her to the slab.Come. We've wasted enough time already. She lies down submissively. Suddenly very tired. Eliot leans over her to apply what's left of the dye.You're a corpse. Your opinion doesn't count anymore.You people. You all think that if you breathe, shit, piss you're alive. Anna doesn't know what to say.You clutch onto life as if your life was worth clutching onto. Was your life worth clutching onto Anna? Anna turns her head away. Clearly he's struck a chord.Was it? Maybe you died a long time ago. Eliot rips off his latex gloves. Tosses them into a bin.I have to tell you I'm surprised you're still arguing with me. You don't have much time left. Look. She's accepted her death. Her life has been examined. She has no more regrets. And now she's at peace. She used her time well. You still have so much to learn.Are you sure? Eliot stands in the doorway. He switches off the light. His body silhouetted by the light from the hallway.Your funeral's in three days. Soon you'll be enclosed in a coffin. Then buried in the ground. No-one will hear you then. No-one will talk to you there. The door clicks shut behind him. Anna doesn't move. Clearly unsettled by Eliot's words. After a moment she looks at the Old Woman. She moves over. Hesitantly pulls away the white sheet. Stares at the Old Woman curiously. Then tentatively touches her cheek.Can I help you? Jack steps back timidly. Eliot looks up. Smiles.Then perhaps you can help me. Could you throw these away for me? Jack nods hesitantly. Moves over and takes the flowers.Thank-you. Eliot turns and arranges fresh flowers in the vase.There's no life left in them.They belong in the garbage. Jack turns to leave.I've seen you round here before. Jack's suddenly nervous.Did you know Mrs. Whitehall?Ah. Miss Bryant. No. Her funeral's not until Friday.She's downstairs.Why? Because she's not ready.And you are?Well Jack. What did you think?Mrs. Whitehall's funeral. Did you find it interesting?Oh. I see.No Jack. They're never the same. Each one is special. The dead always speak to us in different ways.It was a pleasure talking to you Jack.You'll be at peace soon. I promise. For a moment we see a deep sadness in Eliot's eyes. He's conflicted. But then abruptly he pulls himself together. Moves away and starts clearing up. Anna closes her eyes. Hugs her legs closer to her chest.It's your dress. For your funeral. Your mother brought it round this morning. As Eliot takes out a pair of shiny black shoes from a plastic bag, Anna moves haltingly over to the dress. She touches the material puzzled.Why are you still struggling?There's nothing out there for you anymore. As Eliot turns back to the gurney, Anna notices Eliot's jacket hanging beside her. Realizes the KEYS are in the pocket. She quickly glances back at Eliot. He's still busy adjusting the gurney. She leans over to his jacket.I'll be back soon. The door locks behind him with a CLICK.I'm the only one who can hear you now. Anna drops the phone. Backs away towards a window. Eliot walks over and calmly replaces the phone.I'd be very careful if I were you. The dead have such a hold over the living.He still feels your presence. You're only causing him more pain. If you really loved him, you'd accept your death and let him go.You people. You always need proof. Eliot places his hands on her shoulders. Turns her towards a tall mirror.Because you are a corpse.It's time you finally accepted the truth. You are dead. You will never live again.What do you mean?No. It's no problem at all. He glances at his watch.I'll pick up the deceased from the hospital. Yes. This afternoon? That'll be fine. It's my pleasure Mr. Merano.His mouth. To keep it closed. Eliot imbeds one barb into the upper gum then pries back Frank's lower lip. He attaches the other barb into the lower gum, then twists the wires tightly together. He picks up two plastic caps covered in small knobs.Now his eyes. He inserts the caps into Frank's eyes. Pulls his eyelids over them. Glues the eyelids together.No. There's no need. I had to rebuild his face. You're still beautiful.Yes. A brother. He's coming in later. Anna touches the white sheet covering Frank's body.I'm sorry.It's not important anymore.You should rest. He guides her back to the slab. Helps her lie down.You're getting weaker. It's almost time. Eliot strokes her hair tenderly. She looks up at him.Yes. Of course.To make life important. Anna's fingers curl around his hand. Like a vulnerable child. Totally trusting in him. Eliot looks down at Anna sadly. We sense he's conflicted. Confused. Wavering. But then reluctantly he reaches for a SYRINGE filled with AMBER LIQUID on the steel trolley. He injects her gently in the neck. Watches over her for a moment. Then moves to the window. He picks up a window pole. Pulls the shutter across the window plunging the room into darkness.Mrs. Whitehall. Susan. I hope you found what you were looking for.Think nothing of it Mr. Houseman. No need to apologize. Eliot moves over to the wall.I really enjoyed our time together. We pull back slowly. Eliot's talking to a POLAROID of an OLD MAN. We pull back further... the wall's covered in HUNDREDS OF POLAROIDS of BODIES in open coffins. Most of them have closed eyes but we glimpse some with their eyes wide open. Eerily staring at us. Eliot touches the Polaroid of a YOUNG MAN. We see the fear in the Young Man's eyes.Anthony. Anthony. Always confused. Just then we hear the doorbell ringing downstairs. Eliot moves to the window.How can I help you Officer?Mr. Merano. Yes. Of course.It's no trouble at all.Your brother's here. Vincent turns back to Eliot. We're not sure if Eliot was speaking to Frank or to Vincent. Eliot pulls the sheet away. Frank's face is flawless. No sign of any damage.You should remember him as he used to be. Suddenly we hear a FAINT RUSTLING sound. Vincent glances again at Anna's body. Her head is now turned to one side. Wasn't she facing upwards a moment ago? Vincent's puzzled for a second then shrugs. Must have been his imagination.Not right? Vincent nods towards Frank's body.Smiley.I'm glad I could help.No. Not at all. I'll wait outside. As Eliot leaves, Vincent looks at Frank's body. After a moment he glances at Anna again. Then at the door. He quickly moves over to Anna. Looks at her curiously then pulls down the sheet. He reaches over... and CARESSES HER BREAST. Mesmerized by her naked body. As Vincent's hand moves down her body, he bumps against the trolley. Instruments CRASH to the floor. He pulls back the sheet just as Eliot enters the room.I just told you. That was your brother. You had an accident. You're dead. Why do you people never listen to me? Frank doesn't move. His mouth still wired shut.No. It's not a gift. It's a curse. Eliot picks up a compact. Roughly layers Frank's cheeks with thick rouge. With every word he gets more agitated.I take care of each of you as if you were my children. I wash the shit from your bodies. I dress you. I do everything to make you look more beautiful than when you were alive. And what do you do? Eliot's extremely irritated now. He grabs a garish red lipstick. Smears Frank's lips.You argue with me. As if it were my fault you're dead. As if I was to blame. What? You're not talking to me now? You don't want to?You don't talk because you have nothing to say. And you have nothing to say because you're a corpse.No. Now I don't want to talk to you anymore.Jack.You have empathy with the dead. You're drawn to them. Just as they're drawn to you. It's a rare gift. Jack can't look Eliot in the eye.I know you saw Anna. Jack hesitates. Then nods his head.You're frightened by it. I was scared too the first time. But you shouldn't be. Christ had the same gift. He raised Lazarus and spoke to the dead.Yes.Yes. Many others.My mother. Jack looks up sharply. Eliot's words have clearly struck a chord.You shouldn't be afraid.I've been gardening. He walks over to the sink. Scrubs his nails.Yes. The tulips love the sun.Tulips? Yes. I think so. Eliot raises Anna's arm. Delicately washes her armpit. Along the length of her arm. Her skin pale.No. They symbolize purity. He moves to her breasts, following the contours of her body. Pausing every now and then to rinse the sponge.Unrequited love.A beautiful flower. They need shade and lots of water.Faithfulness.Mr. Conran. A pleasure. Eliot stands stiffly. Rubs his back.I love gardening, but I'm not sure gardening loves me anymore.I'm sorry?Do you mean Jack? Paul's momentarily taken aback.Of course I know him. He's often round here. He seems to have a strange fascination with death. He's eleven years old Mr. Conran. And like all young boys has a vivid imagination. Now if you'll excuse me--Maybe you just want to believe he saw her.Mr. Conran!Mr. Conran. I think you should leave before I call the police. Paul notices the stairs leading down to the Prep Room.Mr. Conran. She's dead. Paul pushes him away.I know what you're going through. Denial's a natural part of grieving......but you've got to accept she's gone.You can't help her anymore. Believe me.It's only a hole in the ground. I'm digging it for--Exactly. For Anna. She belongs here.No. Because there's no life left in her. Jack carefully considers Eliot's words.Don't you see? I have no choice. I'm the only one who can see all these corpses. Wandering the earth aimlessly. All they do is piss and shit. Suffocating us with their stench. Doing nothing with their lives. Taking the air away from those who actually want to live. I have to bury them all. I have no choice.You did well this morning.When Paul came. You did the right thing. You let him go.Tomorrow's your funeral. Eliot lifts Anna's arms and puts them through the sleeves of the dress. Her body's stiff and unyielding.I told you. You only had three days. He delicately turns her onto her side. Buttons up the dress.I told you to use your time well. Anna frowns. As if trying to remember something. Eliot gently lifts her legs. Pulls on a pair of black tights.You're here to understand your life. So you can finally be at peace.Then why didn't you do anything about it?What did you really want from life?Yes you do! You're just too scared to admit it to yourself. Anna turns away ashamed. She knows he's right.What did you want from life?You had love. Paul loved you.Did you?What would you do if you had another chance? Anna's puzzled. Eliot goes to the door and unlocks it. Moonlight floods in from upstairs. Washing it with a cold light. Anna doesn't move.Well? Isn't this what you wanted? Eliot holds out his hand. Anna takes it hesitantly and rises from the slab.I thought you were different. You all say you're scared of death. But the truth is you're more scared of life. Eliot switches off the lights.It's...You have to look beautiful for your funeral. He picks up a SYRINGE and an ampoule of AMBER LIQUID. Fills the syringe.This will relax your muscles. Make your skin radiant. As if you were still alive. Just sleeping.This is how they'll all remember you.The last part is the most difficult. You'll have to face it alone. But you'll be at peace soon. Anna nods. SIGHS deeply... her BREATH FOGS the mirror. She frowns. Touches the SMALL CIRCLE OF CONDENSATION on the glass. Looks up at Eliot in shock.Anna. We've been through this before. You're just imagining--You're still clutching onto life. Don't give in to your fears. You're so close. Anna's fading away. Her hand drops limply to her side.Good bye Anna.Violets just seemed appropriate somehow.Imagine Anna. The whole world, your mother, your fianc\u00e9e, your friends. Everyone has buried you. They've placed a stone above your body.They've said their good byes and gone back to their TV dinners and shopping malls. Thinking that this is never going to happen to them. Until it's their turn to be buried. Think about it Anna... Eliot glances at his watch....think about it while you still can.Don't you think you've had enough to drink? Paul turns. Eliot stands beside him. Paul pours himself another drink.Wasn't she? Eliot's suddenly tired of Paul's allegations.Mr. Conran. You come to my Funeral Home, making wild accusations. You have no idea what happens when someone dies. What happens to their body. What happens to their soul.Maybe she's still alive. You obviously don't believe a word I say. So why don't you go and find out for yourself Mr. Conran. Find out whether she's alive or dead. Paul grabs Eliot by his lapels. Shoves him against the wall.You don't have much time left. Father Graham puts his hand on Paul's arm.You're in a funeral home.You had a car accident. You swerved off the road. On the way to the cemetery. Hit a tree.I'm sorry Mr. Conran. You never made it to the cemetery. You never saw Anna. You're dead. Paul's glazed eyes widen in shock.Your skull was crushed. Your spinal cord pulverized. Your brain cells are slowly dying. Your body's already decomposing.You people. You all say the same thing. Eliot's voice, with each word, fades further and further away. Paul closes his eyes.", "clean_line": "antique carlisle solid cherry hand rubbed satin finish tufted sovereign interior eternal rest adjustable mattress matching pillow gestures metal casket aegean
