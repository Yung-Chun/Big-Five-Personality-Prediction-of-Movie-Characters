{"My-Week-with-Marilyn": {"COLIN": {"raw_line": "I'm leaving for London now, Pa.I'm off now, Mama.My job interview, remember..? But she is already continuing her journey. COLIN smiles hurriedly at KENNETH, who gives him an affectionate wave as COLIN dashes after his mother. She leaves the Library.I don't want to be late in the morning. As COLIN hurries after JANE he is nearly run down by an elderly GARDENER with a lawn mower, and has to take lightning evasive action. JANE doesn't notice.I wish he hadn't done that. I can manage on my own. She stops so abruptly he nearly slams into her. JANE looks around the garden with a frown.Larry told me to come. She pauses dubiously, then reaches for her telephone. We hear a man answer in an office down the hall, his voice carrying irritably.A job on your Marilyn Monroe film.I want to work on the production side. He smiles with as much charm as he can muster. PERCEVAL isn't impressed.May I wait?Until there's a job.Something might come up. PERCEVAL is distracted as the telephone rings.I'll come back tomorrow morning. Just in case.If I have to.I'd do anything to be in the film business.Laurence Olivier Productions...He's at Notley until the end of the week. Can I take a message?Vanessa asked me to...There didn't seem any need to bother you. But if you want me to transfer every single one... PERCEVAL looks at him grudgingly.I will. Mama, you're an angel.I had a bit of luck. PERCEVAL looks at him shrewdly.Yes, sir. COLIN leaves.You said there might be a job on your film. OLIVIER has no recollection of this and fumbles in his pockets to cover his confusion, bringing out a packet of cigarettes and offering them to COLIN with breezy charm.We'd pay a hundred pounds per week for 18 weeks.That's a pity. I'll have to tell Miss Monroe to look elsewhere, then. COTES-PREEDY double takes.It's Marilyn Monroe in the film. COTES-PREEDY smiles transparently.Good morning, Mr. Jacobs. I hope you had a pleasant flight.It's very near Pinewood.Yes we can. I knew Cotes-Preedy wouldn't be able to keep this quiet. They stare to him in surprise. He looks at them boldly.When you asked me to find a house for Miss Monroe I took the precaution of finding two. The other one, Parkside, is much better and the owner is very discreet.I thought someone else on the production might want it.Nothing...Colin Clark. Sir Laurence Olivier Productions.Paula?Why not?No...How do I get in the union?But you just said I couldn't have a job on the film unless I was in the union.A third?Assisting the director?Got it. But he sneaks a look back at LUCY as he goes.My father's place in the Albany.She's all right. A bit common.But she's only been married three weeks.I'm sure he loves you very much. There is a flash of sudden anger in her expression.Of course. Everyone does. There is a wintry bleakness in her face for a second.Colin Clark. I booked a room. BARRY takes a dusty ledger from beneath the bar, spins it around for COLIN to sign.I'm here working on a film. The LOCALS look up from their pints, unimpressed.It's called `The Sleeping Prince'. The darts player, ANDY, doesn't turn. His aim remains steady.Marilyn Monroe's in it. I'll be working with her.Miss Monroe? The door opens sharply and a small, bohemian looking woman in her 50s stands staring at him. This is PAULA STRASBERG.Sir Laurence sends his compliments. He's ready for theCome out with me tonight.Tomorrow night, then.Your hair's lovely. She stops to look at him, attracted but cautious.Everyone has a lot of rules around here.Why not?I'm not like that. She looks at him sceptically.Really.They're ready for you in make-up Dame Sybil.I don't know, Dame Sybil. I've never had one before. DAME SYBIL gazes at him with wistful sadness.Not yet.I do...She's... getting into character.Would you like to sit down, Dame Sybil?What?If anyone can make her great, it's you. You're a genius.You really were very good, Miss Monroe. MARILYN smiles vaguely. PAULA gives him a fierce look - COLIN moves past quickly.Oh, it's all right.It's worth it. LUCY can't help being charmed.I'm not living off my parents, if that's what you mean. I want to make my own way, no matter what.Who told you that?Vivien's a friend of my father's.Certainly not. I settle my own bills. The WAITER nods discreetly and leaves. LUCY looks at COLIN with a teasing smile.I was always going to pay, you know.Not compared to you. LUCY laughs, COLIN looks hurt.So they say.Which one is which? She bursts out laughing. Her eyes sparkle and she looks captivating in the glistening lights. He goes to kiss her and this time she doesn't stop him.I really do like you, Lucy. She looks at him shrewdly.Yes, I should be off. Colin Clark. Pleased to meet you, Mr. Armstrong. He offers the surprised MR. ARMSTRONG a confident handshake.This is a very nice house you've got.Next Saturday? She nods. He follows her out into the hall.Thank you, Dame Sybil.Why not only show her the good takes? Then she might feel better about herself. He looks self-conscious as they both turn to stare at him.They just upset her.Your script...David wants to know if you're ready for the extras in the ballroom scene.Larry asked me to help out. She smiles sardonically, teasing him, but a little hurt.Next Friday instead? She shrugs in agreement.I'll pick you up. Eight o'clock. He smiles, a little too glibly, and hurries away. LUCY gazes after him. He doesn't look back.It's Saturday. Early closing. But they're expecting us. She stops to window shop. MILTON lowers his voice to COLIN.At least she can shop in peace.Maybe she's scared.But you have the training to deal with it. OLIVIER turns from the mirror to survey him.Are you sure they won't mind?You mean Miller?Good morning, Miss Monroe. She is hunched in the back, her hair in a scarf, her face protected by her large sunglasses with PAULA by her side. She doesn't look up.24. NearlyI'm the third assistant director. Just a gopher really. Go for this, go for that...He was worried about you.No! Of course not. Why would anyone spy on you? She sighs, and looks away.Are you all right, Miss Monroe? He waits hesitantly, but she seems to have drifted off. But then, suddenly, she turns back to him, her eyes huge.Yours, Miss Monroe. She rewards him with a brilliant smile, her whole face lighting up.Nothing happened.Paula was with us the whole time.I'm doing my best... VIVIEN glances away to see MARILYN standing nearby, awkward and excluded. She has come straight from make-up and wears only a towelling robe, slippers and curlers in her hair.Roger? CUT TO PARKSIDE, where, to Colin's astonishment MARILYN comes on the line .Yes, I'm sure I can do that. CUT TO PARKSIDE. MARILYN smiles.She wants to see me.I was just... checking you've got everything you need. She walks to the sideboard, standing only a few inches away from him. He can't take his eyes from hers. He drops his gaze, only to find himself staring at her breasts. He looks up again sharply but not before she notices. She takes the decanter from his hand.No.I'm only the third. Just a messenger, really.There's no Mrs. Colin.I'll tell you what's wrong. It's agony for him because he's a great actor who wants to be a film star, and agony for you because you're a film star who wants to be a great actress. And this film won't help either of you. He stops, breathless, knowing he has gone to far. She stares at him, wide-eyed with surprise. Horribly self- conscious he takes a too large swig of his brandy, reddens and coughs. She laughs.I'm 23, Miss Monroe.Seven years is nothing. She smiles then sits opposite him.You were just looking for the right man.Hello?Everything's fine. Miss Monroe just had... some large packages she needed handling... He looks at MARILYN's voluptuous figure. MARILYN looks back innocently and mouths the word \"packages\". She giggles. He turns crimson with the effort of trying to suppress his own laughter but MARILYN isn't helping. She teasingly makes shapes in the air of just how large the packages might be. He covers the phone, agonised, before they both collapse in irrepressible laughter. COLIN finally pulls himself together.Hello? Milton? There is a long silence at the other end of the line.She's tied up right now. This only sets MARILYN off again. She howls with laughter and COLIN can't help joining her.I'm sorry, Milton. I have to go. He hangs up quickly. They both laugh helplessly. MARILYN smiles.You should get out more. See the sights.I don't think he'd mind.He doesn't understand your kind of actor. He's hated the method ever since Vivien worked with Elia Kazan. It's all too new and strange. You're the future, and it frightens him.I didn't spend the night with her. We just had a chat.She just wants a chum, that's all.She was just being friendly.Oh, fuck off, Dickie. You've never slept with a woman in your life.He doesn't even know who I am.Maybe she was trying to make him jealous... ORTON turns around frowning furiously at the voices behind the set. MILTON pushes COLIN off the set ahead of him.I don't need your advice. And I'm not in love with her.Oh, God... I'm sorry... I forgot... I've just been so busy.Of course not. You know how crews like to gossip. His voice trails off lamely as he realises he is repeating what he has just said to Lucy. MARILYN smiles.Lucy, I really like you. We've had such fun...Is she okay? In the same moment MARILYN herself erupts from under the blanket in the back.Oh, Jesus - She laughs, looking wonderfully naughty.Oh, God. If Milton sees me with you... I'll be sacked... He tries to scramble out but MARILYN hauls him back gleefully.We have today, anyway. One day to do whatever we like. We can go back to real life tomorrow.Well, maybe the weekend.We could go to Windsor Castle, if you like. MARILYN's face breaks into a smile of pure delight.Clark. Colin Clark. The POLICEMAN retreats into his box. We hear him talking on the telephone. ROGER looks at COLIN. He shrugs sheepishly.My father knows everybody. A moment later the policeman returns, looking surprised.Eton is 500 years old. It was founded by King Henry VI.Take that room up there. They stop as COLIN points up at a window.That's where the boys were sent if they didn't work hard enough. Where we were whipped. MARILYN looks at him in shock.Beaten. She looks appalled.Five years. But I was sent to boarding school when I was eight.That's what we do in my family. She smiles at this, looking at him shrewdly.In one way, yes. But when you're brought up in a house of over- achievers, it's hard to make your own mark. She looks at him, sympathetic but pushing a little harder.Maybe it will be in films, but if not, there are so many possibilities out there.But we haven't got any... He stops in mid-sentence as he sees MARILYN unbuttoning her blouse and throwing it off carelessly.What if a boat goes past? We could be arrested.What's wrong?I can't see anything.Let me warm you up. She snuggles into him gratefully, her teeth chattering. He rubs her naked back briskly, her thin blouse the only barrier between their bodies. Slowly his embrace becomes more sensual, his hands slowing, stroking rather than rubbing, his face buried in her hair, his arms pulling herShe was fine.Don't start, Dicky.She's trying her best.But she was wonderful yesterday. MILTON looks at him for a long moment, masking his hostility in barbed politeness.She doesn't need pills! She just needs someone to care for her.I told you, I'm not in love with her!She said that?Roger? What's the matter?Is she dead?How can she be asking for me if she's in a coma?How many pills did she take?Marilyn? There is no reply.I'll open the door once I'm inside.Marilyn? A shaft of moonlight reveals MARILYN lying naked across the bed, her body partly covered by the sheet. Half empty pill and champagne bottles are scattered all over her dresser; there is also an old photograph in a silver frame of her mother Gladys.Marilyn? For a second he fears the worst, but then suddenly she groans and sits up, looking at him blearily.Are you okay? Everyone was worried about you.It's me. She's fine but I'm going to keep an eye on her. I'll sleep on the sofa.I can't find the key. You can all go to bed now.I came in through the window... He realises this doesn't sound reassuring.Milton thought you were sick. She stares at him in puzzlement then breaks into a dazed smile.Please don't take any more pills. She frowns, clutching the pill bottle in one hand. He reaches out and prises it gently from her grasp. As he puts it back on the side he glances at the framed photograph. COLIN Who's that?Abraham Lincoln?Yes, I do.Yes.I'm sure they do. He nods. She smiles sadly.Yes. She reaches for the pills and pours three or four into her palm. COLIN gently takes her hand and takes two of them away. She smiles, not objecting as he settles her back gently on the pillow.But you and I come from different worlds. You're like some Greek Goddess to me...Mr. Miller loves you. She stares at him, her face going blank with misery.Writers scribble all kinds of things. It doesn't mean anything. She looks at him, her eyes full of pain.I'll never leave you. She smiles and embraces him gratefully. She sighs.I don't want to. I love you, Marilyn. She stares at him and tears gather in her eyes again. They stare intently at each other, their mood fragile, touched with both sensuality and a longing for something less tangible. MARILYN leans forward and kisses him gently. The embrace grows in passion and they kiss properly, hungrily. He kisses her eyes and her face and she sighs happily. He wants her more than he has wanted anything before.Maybe we should just be friends.Who's Johnny?Marilyn? She mutters softly in reply.Do one thing for me? Come into the studio on time tomorrow and show everybody what you can do. Show Larry you're a great actress.Oh, I'm pretty sure she'll be in this morning. OLIVIER gives COLIN an odd look.Of course I do. You were wonderful today. PAULA looks at MILTON, then moves between them busily.You heard what she said. She wants me here.I'm here now. I'll look after you. She gives him a wry look, teasing but thoughtful.Marilyn, unlock the door.I won't. MILTON gives him a sharp look but he no longer cares about anything except Marilyn. There is a shuffling sound and the door is unlocked. At the same moment PAULA comes rushing in, hair awry, gown flapping, a wild look in her eye.I haven't done anything. She's just... got a stomach ache. He reddens with embarrassment. ROGER coughs.She's not dying, for Christ's sake. The HOUSEKEEPER now appears at the door with an elderly man at her side. He nods briskly.Was she really pregnant?I don't want to forget. He struggles then suddenly bursts out passionately.Let me protect you from all this... She smiles sadly.Why not? You could come and live at my parents place. You'd love it. It's a castle, like in a fairy tale. We wouldn't even have to live together. You could have your own suite of rooms... He is close to tears, suddenly looking very young. She looks at him with a sad, sweet smile. He shakes his head stubbornly, taking her hand in passionate appeal.You could quit. Forget Marilyn Monroe, forget Hollywood. Let it all go.Why not, when it drives you crazy? Her eyes widen in surprise. A flicker of nervous insecurity dulls her expression.I didn't mean that. I just meant you could be happy.Of course you're happy. You're a star. The biggest star in the world. She smiles, reassured. He drags himself off the bed and goes to the door, pausing for a second as he looks back.You're right, Marilyn. We have to forget all this.From now on I'm nobody. Just the third. You don't even know I exist. We'll never look at each other again. She giggles with some of her old playfulness.They're ready for you on set, Sir Laurence.She's just arrived.Aren't you going to throw yours away?Lucy? She turns back to look at him.I was wondering if you're doing anything this Saturday.A little.Prospero.You should tell her that.I thought you hated all that Royal Court stuff.Run it again, please. The lights go down. MARILYN's face appears on the screen, laughing and happy. It is another sequence, the one where Marilyn does her sweet, uninhibited little dance , a performance both sexy and yet touchingly innocent. HOLD on COLIN for a long moment, gazing at her image in the darkness, then -Can I get another one of those please, Barry? BARRY for once is silent, pours a pint. The regulars try not to stare.As if I could.Everyone else doesn't understand. She smiles, touched.What's that for?No - just a good friend of mine. BARRY walks back into the pub, leaving COLIN alone, staring at the vanishing car. And then the sun swallows it as it drives into the English countryside.Any messages? THE SECRETARY pushes a piece of paper at him.Did she say anything?Probably. Book a call as soon as you can. Los Angeles, California.

it is simply impossible to get Marilyn Monroe on the telephone? The darling girl spends the entire day asleep. But great beauty has its way... He laughs, but then notices VIVIEN's less than enthusiastic response. Seeking refuge in some distraction he notices COLIN hovering by the sofa.Hello, boy... remind me? He smiles vaguely and glances at VIVIEN for help.Have a cigarette. Keep the pack. He turns quickly to PERCEVAL.There won't be any film unless Miss Monroe gets her splendid posterior out of bed.I'll have a word with the American ambassador. I'm taking him to see Vivien in South Sea Bubble on Thursday... now, tell me, Hughie, are Terry's rewrites in? He puts an arm around PERCEVAL's shoulders and they disappear together into Perceval's office. VIVIEN lingers behind, smiling radiantly at COLIN who looks dumbly at the packet of cigarettes in his hand. He now sees they are called \"Oliviers\". VIVIEN wrinkles her nose in amusement.Let's try to find him something to do, Hughie. COLIN grins in triumph. VIVIEN smiles at him.News travels fast.What are we paying you, boy? He glances at COLIN with amusement.Beige, then. Beige is rarely controversial. JACOBS considers this, unaware that Olivier is teasing him.Stanislavski and the Method are perfectly fine in the rehearsal room but they don't belong on a film set. Time is too tight. I'm sure Marilyn understands. He turns and walks away. JACOBS frowns uncertainly.Naturally, Vivien and I will be there to greet her. But let's keep it low key, shall we?It is a deep happiness to me to be translating Terence Rattigan's magnificent play to the screen... A voice suddenly rings out from the back of the previously attentive crowd.It's my genuine pleasure to introduce a woman who needs no introduction.A great actress on her first trip to London whom I have no doubt...In The Sleeping Prince we have discovered the perfect vehicle for Miss Monroe's luminous and justly celebrated talent... He stops as a REPORTER shouts over him.You have my new assistant Colin to thank for that. This is Milton Greene. You must be very nice to him. He owns half of Marilyn Monroe Productions.Have a cigarette.Milton - Marilyn and rehearsals. Let's talk.Marilyn, here you are, everyone is so excited to meet you... He gestures to the company.Let us begin. Do sit down, please... SYBIL THORNDIKE looks sweetly at MARILYN from across the table and indicates the empty one at her side.Welcome dear Marilyn, to our little fraternity. We may seem a little strange and quaint to you at first, but I hope that in time you may come to find your method in our madness. Pleased with his over-contrived rhetorical flourish, he gives Paula a pointed look. She glowers back, obscurely sensing that she has been insulted in some way. MARILYN also looks up in confusion at Olivier's well intentioned but clumsy joke. Oblivious to her reaction, he opens his script with a sentimental flourish.So. My very noble and approv'd good masters, let us now embark on our great voyage of discovery together. With boldness and good fortune, may we strive to create a work of art that, led by your good graces, will be cherished as long as motion pictures may be remembered. He is momentarily close to tears. WATTIS rolls his eyes discreetly, earning a grin from the actor PAUL HARDWICK. There is a rustle of pages and a few coughs, a mood of eager nervousness in the air as they all prepare for the reading.\"Were you surprised to get my invitation?\" MARILYN stares at him for a beat then reads haltingly.\"oh but of course I meant you. I had your name most carefully marked down on my programme. In matters of this kind I assure you I am most methodical. Who did you think I meant if not you?\" MARILYN drops out of character with a sweet, nervous smile.You are amongst friends, my darling angel. Just plain Larry will suffice. When you're ready..? Flustered, MARILYN looks at her script.\"Oh, no, no, no not Maisie Springfield, she's quite what I would call old hat... PAULA leans across, mounting a whispered running commentary in Marilyn's ear as OLIVIER speaks.It's your line, Marilyn.It is only a readthrough, Paula.The character is on the page.We can't have two fucking directors!Why? She's got me!Dear Christ, what have I got myself into?Marilyn here yet?She's kept Dame Sybil Thorndike waiting in full costume for two hours. It's simply not fair. The door finally opens and MARILYN emerges, with PAULA on one side and MILTON on the other. In her figure-hugging shimmering white sheath of a dress she is ravishingly beautiful. Her hair is like a halo of light around her head. No one can take their eyes off her. Slowly, all work on the set stops. MARILYN walks to the set, acutely aware of the scrutiny of the crew. She smiles nervously, then suddenly hesitates, feeling the weight of everyone's attention. Anxiety flits across her face. She whispers something to PAULA and bolts back towards her dressing room. OLIVIER stares after her in shock.What's wrong?Right, Mr. Orton you wanted me to check the back projection. Please join us, Mr. Cardiff. He stalks away, followed by Cardiff and Orton.\"Now, before you meet my mother- in-law I must warn you she is a little vague and can be very deaf... on occasions.\" SYBIL THORNDIKE sweeps through the door right on cue, with MAUD, her lady-in-waiting, following. She is effortlessly in command of her lines.\"Might I present Miss Elsie Marina?\"Cut. SYBIL THORNDIKE smiles cheerfully.\"She says she is deeply flattered and compliments you on your wonderful memory.\" MARILYN jumps in, shouting her line over the top of him.Cut.\"She says she is an actress.\" MARILYN looks at him, hesitant but just about in character. OLIVIER glances at ORTON who nods.Cut it there.Print. There is a near-audible sigh of relief around the set. SYBIL THORNDIKE smiles.She's impossible. I should have cast Vivien.Oh, yes. The world's greatest living actor, so they say. OLIVIER looks at him, wanting to be reassured. He fumbles for a cigarette with shaking fingers and COLIN hurries to light it. He smiles wryly.Let's hope I'm as brilliant as you think I am. Now be a good boy and keep an eye on her.She should be on time, like everyone else.I'm a fucking star! He looks around in frustration.If we nip this behaviour in the bud perhaps it won't be repeated.Marilyn, darling you are an angel, and I kiss the hem of your garment, but why can't you get here on time for the love of fuck?You must apologise to Dame Sybil. MARILYN reddens with humiliation as he takes her arm.We've only been shooting for four days and we're already two weeks behind. COLIN can't resist blurting out a comment.I believe it's traditional for the producer of the film to watch rushes. Besides, she's an experienced actress. She should learn from her mistakes.Not half as much as they upset me.Cut. The line is \"Gee, this is all right too, isn't it\". It's a tiny word, my darling, but it matters. Let's go straight away. MARILYN smiles vaguely. HAIR and MAKE-UP rush to do last minute checks.Cut. Nearly there, but Terry did work so very hard on this and we must try to get it right for him. Straight away, please. Take three.Cut.The point is that you have already admired the downstairs hall in an earlier scene. Now you are admiring this room as well.Then she should pretend to believe it. PAULA bristles at this insult to her husband's work.We're in absolute agreement, Paula. Acting is all about sincerity. And if you can fake that, you're off to the races. PAULA only stares at him in disgust. Thoroughly alarmed, MILTON intervenes.Eight months of this? I'd rather kill myself. Throughout all this MARILYN herself looks lost. COLIN watches her as she feels the crew's irritable collective gaze. Flustered, she flutters her hands in a calming gesture, then goes to the side of the set to lean on a bar put there for her to rest on . PAULA accompanies her. MARILYN looks up at her in anguish.(Under his breath toCut. A look of near-panic creeps into Marilyn's eyes at her inability to remember the line.Cut. What's the matter now? He takes her arm and whisks her away to the side of the set, lowering his voice, trying to conceal his exasperation with a honeyed tone.Forgive me, Marilyn. This is my failure, not yours. Tell me how I can help you.Elsie is all in the scriptBut you have her precisely, you know her inside out. I'm in awe of your gift. We all are.Why not simply rely on your natural talents?Marilyn, you are the most attractive woman in the world. I'm simply suggesting you be yourself.All you have to do, dear Marilyn, is be sexy. Isn't that what you do? MARILYN flinches as though slapped. Tension ripples through the set. COLIN watches in dismay.You've already got Paula, for heaven's sake. I'm the director. Speak to me.It's five in the morning in New York.\"O, now, for ever Farewell the tranquil mind/Farewell content/ Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars/That make ambition virtue O, farewell/Farewell...\" Paula's not an actress. She not a director, not a teacher. Her only talent is buttering up Marilyn.You know what would make Marilyn Monroe a real actor? A season in rep. They wouldn't stand for this kind of nonsense at the Hippodrome in Eastbourne.Trying to teach Marilyn how to act is like teaching Urdu to a badger. MILTON gives him a look but says nothing. Instead he picks up his bag and opens it. It is stuffed with bottles of pills. He takes one of them, checks the label and puts it in his pocket.Pills to sleep, pills to wake up. Pills to calm her down, pills to give her energy. No wonder she's permanently ten feet underwater.We're all scared. It's part of being an actor.I wouldn't buy the little girl lost act if I were you. Though heaven knows it's tempting. He sighs wistfully.And I think Marilyn knows exactly what she's doing. COLIN isn't so sure but wisely holds his tongue.You better get over to Parkside and make sure the poor girl's all right. And Colin? Don't forget who you work for.It's nearly lunch time.It's a light comedy. How much feeling can it possibly require?She can't hide in her bloody dressing room all day.That won't help Marilyn.About her? He looks up and nods slowly.But you do love her? Your new bride and all that? MILLER plays with his whisky.You shouldn't upset yourself. You are ten times the actress she will ever be.There's never been anything between Marilyn and me. She laughs hysterically.You're imagining things.Vivien..! She storms out. After a beat, COLIN tentatively enters. OLIVIER looks at COLIN in muted apology.She hasn't been well. There was a baby... she... we... lost it... COLIN looks down awkwardly. OLIVIER sighs.Do you have a cigarette, Colin? COLIN hurries to offer him one of his \"Oliviers\". OLIVIER grimaces wryly.Not one of those awful things. COLIN finds a woodbine in his other pocket and gives it to OLIVIER, who lights it with a shaking hand. He inhales deeply.Vivien's right... I did think I would fall shatteringly in love with Marilyn. What a joke. He looks at COLIN, his feelings raw and exposed.Remember, boy, when it comes to women you are never too old for humiliation.He's only going to visit his children.Perhaps she's come back. Yes?Oh, Roger. What's up?Yes, he's here. It's for you. Puzzled, COLIN takes the phone as OLIVIER stares at him.Why is Marilyn on the phone to my third fucking assistant? COLIN looks around helplessly.Well? What did she want?I'm sure Colin knows what he's doing. Don't you, Colin? There is a warning as well as approval in his tone.I don't care if he fucks her sideways. Perhaps it'll calm her down. Oh, hello, boy. He smiles cheerfully.I hear you spent last night with Marilyn.Perhaps if Colin is very diplomatic Marilyn is more likely to behave herself.I thought working with Marilyn would make me feel young again. But I look dead in the rushes. Dead behind the eyes. He gazes at himself thoughtfully.Perhaps I'm angry with her because in my heart I know my own career is in a terrible rut. I wanted to renew myself through her but all I see reflected in that magnificent face is my own inadequacy. He leans back.You know, I admire Marilyn. I really do. Despite her behaviour. She has taken everything Hollywood can throw at her and triumphed. COLIN waits, uncertain why OLIVIER is confiding in him.An actress has to be pretty tough to get even a tenth as far as she has. He glances up at COLIN in the mirror, shrewd and sympathetic.But be careful, boy. She doesn't need to be rescued. Not really.You spent the day with her. What frame of mind was she in?Morning, boy. Christ, you look rough. He looks at him thoughtfully, then shrugs.Let me know when Marilyn arrives. If she ever does.\"This is intolerable\"!\"Revolution?\"Whatever it was you did to her, boy, keep doing it. OLIVIER grins slyly and COLIN doesn't bother to protest. The phone rings. OLIVIER picks it up.Hello? His face falls as he listens to the voice at the other end of the line.Marilyn?Only an hour late. Not bad by her standards. He smiles, then stands up, straightening his uniform.Maybe we will finish this bloody film after all.\"My dear...\"\"What's that, my beloved?\"\"You do look, my son, in a moved sort/As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir./Our revels now are ended.These our actors,/As I foretold you, were all spirits and/Are melted into air, into thin air...She's quite wonderful. No training, no craft, no guile, just pure instinct. Astonishing. He seems almost lost in awe. COLIN gazes at him in surprise.Oh, I will. But she won't believe me. That's probably what makes her great. It's certainly what makes her so profoundly unhappy. He smiles wryly.I tried my best to change her, but she remains brilliant despite me. Directing a movie has to be just about the best job ever invented, but Marilyn has cured me of ever wanting to do it again. He signals to the projection box and the film stops as the lights come up.And now I'm going back to the theatre. John Osborne is writing a piece for me.You've done a good job, boy. Welcome to the circus. He goes out. COLIN looks back up at the projection box.", "clean_line": "know hughie simply impossible marilyn monroe telephone darling girl spends entire day asleep great beauty way laughs notices vivien

lot.You bet it is. Arthur's the greatest man I ever met. OLIVIER smiles tolerantly, mildly put out at this. MARILYN takes off her sunglasses and blinks. She takes MILLER's arm and looks at him adoringly. He bites down savagely on his unlit pipe.I'd love to see the little fellow with the bow and arrow in Piccadilly Circus. There is a appreciative laughter from reporters.I want to be the best actress I can be.I'm considering it.I'll be playing Grushenka.Sure. Can you? There is laughter at the reporter's expense.My husband is. She looks adoringly at Miller, who smiles vaguely.I guess you could look it up in a dictionary. This time the laughter is emphatically on MARILYN's side. One of the reporters turns to VIVIEN.As I'm in England let's say I sleep in nothing but Yardley's Lavender.Well, that was quieter than some. Vivien smiles at the wry joke. ARTHUR JACOBS watches the proceedings with an eagle eye.Excuse the horrible face. She finds her dark glasses on the dresser and puts them on.\"I'll say I was surprised. I was so surprised I couldn't hardly think you meant me.\"Gee, Mister Sir, I could listen to your accent all day. There are private grins amongst the actors. OLIVIER smiles kindly.\"Well, Maisie Springfield...Oh, let's see... \"Oh, and am I what you'd call new hat?\"Gee. I forgot my line. I'm sorry.\"I'm in The Coconut Girl at The Avenue.\" There is a pause. SYBIL THORNDIKE hesitates.\"I'm in The Coconut Girl at The Avenue\".Can I?I just can't figure this movie out.He was angry with me, I could tell.Come on, Paula, get up.Oh, okay. I guess I was. COLIN glances at her, seeing his chance to help.Oh... you have that word in England too? She looks at him in surprise. She looks sedated, not quite there. PAULA leaps protectively to her defence.I'm sorry...You think I'm a great actress?I found it. Calmly she takes the towel from her hair and wraps it around herself. She smiles quizzically.You can go now, Colin. He hesitates a beat, surprised that she knows his name, before he fumbles for the door.Gee, it's quiet.\"Well we're still the first ones, aren't we? Gee, this is all right, isn't it? OLIVIER looks out from behind the camera, patient and charming.\"Well we're still the first ones, aren't we? Gee, this is all right, isn't it?\"\"Well, we're still the first ones, aren't we? Gee, this is... all right, isn't it?\" By now there is a panic-stricken edge to her voice.Can't we just drop it?Oh, sure. Paula! OLIVIER looks startled. PAULA comes scurrying across. MARILYN appeals to her, turning away from OLIVIER.I don't get it. He's such a strange man. I think she'd figure out he only invited her to sleep with her.I can't do this. I can't. PAULA looks at her adamantly.\"Well we're still the first ones, aren't we? Gee, this is all right, isn't it?\"\"Well we're still the first ones, aren't we? Gee, this is all right too, isn't it?\" There is a stunned moment. WATTIS gapes and MARILYN looks around uncertainly. Did she say it? OLIVIER gestures frantically from behind the camera that she should carry on. She hesitates... ... there is an agonising beat... ... and then she panics and bolts for the side of the set.Paula!I don't know who Elsie is. I can't act her if I don't know who she is!I can't find her. She's not there.She's not real.Are you saying I don't need to act? OLIVIER is bewildered by her inability to appreciate her own natural talent - as he sees it. He looks at her in genuine anguish.I want Lee.How old are you?You remind us of the young king in the movie. Kind of honest and innocent.What's your job on this picture?You're Larry's assistant too. He shrugs awkwardly.What were you doing in my house last night? Did he send you?Are you spying on me?Colin? Whose side are you on? COLIN stares at her. She looks utterly beautiful and vulnerable in the shadowy light. There is only one answer anyone could give.Call me Marilyn. He is suddenly overwhelmed by a rush of sympathy. She looks so lost and vulnerable. Perhaps he means it. Perhaps he is on her side now.Oh, but everyone says you were a wonderful Elsie on stage.Here, let me. She pours some brandy into a glass and gives it to him.Are you frightened of me, Colin?Good. Because I like you. Colin doesn't know what to say. MARILYN gazes at him.I want you to help me. Will you do that? She looks at him, her eyes wide. COLIN feels himself sinking into her gaze.But you know what's going on. You can see both sides of the situation. He shrugs in helpless agreement.I want you to be honest. Tell me everything. She indicates a chair and COLIN perches on it awkwardly.Relax. I thought you weren't scared of me. Are you hungry? I'll have them send in a tray. I'm starved. He doesn't know how to reply and Marilyn misreads his silence. Her eyes widen in dismay.Oh, gee, I'm sorry. Am I interrupting something? Maybe you have a Mrs. Colin waiting for you at home?So we can talk as long as we like? He nods uncertainly. She frowns.Why is Sir Olivier so mean? He talks to me as if he's slumming.Are you sure you can handle that? You don't look old enough to drink.It's Marilyn. I'm 30. I guess that makes me an old lady to you.Do you know I've been married three times already? How did that happen?They always look right at the start. She smiles wistfully. Her presence is overwhelming. The silence stretches for a second, pregnant with strange possibilities. Suddenly the phone rings, making him jump. Automatically he picks it up.Let's walk in the garden. See if we can find any more reporters in the bushes. She giggles. COLIN's heart contracts as she casually takes his arm.I didn't know it was so pretty out here.I am the sights. She giggles again, her mood lighter.Look at us. We're just like Elsie and the young King. What would Sir Laurence say if he could see us now?I wanted to be an artist. To grow as an actor. I was so proud to be working with the great Olivier. Now he thinks I'm the enemy. She looks at him innocently. COLIN hesitates.Every time I walk into the studio I feel this sense of doom come over me. He looks at me like he's smelling a pile of rotten fish. And the crew hate me. Paula is the only person I can trust. Except for you now, maybe. She looks at him, her eyes huge. COLIN feels his senses swim as he stares into them... ... and then ROGER suddenly appears on the steps.Goodbye, Colin. Thanks for telling me the truth. COLIN stares after her. It is a second before he realises that ROGER is gazing at him sternly.Hi, Colin. COLIN smiles, self-conscious. MARILYN stops and frowns, looking at Lucy.Hey, are you guys dating? That's what I heard. She looks at him expectantly and suddenly his growing fantasy that she might actually be interested in him kicks in hard. He shrugs casually.Too bad. You look cute together. She walks off with her retinue. There is a long pause. COLIN looks up to see LUCY staring at him in dismay. There are sudden tears in her eyes, which she wipes away angrily.Roger and I decided to take you out for an adventure. Didn't we Roger?No one can sack you, Colin. Except me, of course. She pats the seat next to her.I don't like being on my own in the back. Before COLIN can respond he sees the curious MILTON running back, having spotted MARILYN in the back.Do you think he saw me? COLIN can't help laughing. He finally tumbles into the back seat with MARILYN as the car speeds away. She scoots up to make room for him.Snuggle up. This is fun. She threads her arm through his. He gazes down at their hands meshed together. ROGER's disapproval registers in the faintest flicker of his eyes. In the background the defeated and frustrated MILTON watches the car speed away.This is how I ought to feel every day. COLIN smiles. Impulsively MARILYN hugs him.Let's run away together. He turns ashen.Only one day?Or a week? He grins. She takes his hand, walking contentedly at his side.What shall we do?We met at a movie premiere. She said my dress was pretty.Gee, I'd love to read all these books some time.She's beautiful.I hope I look that good when I'mI've heard of him! Didn't he paint that lady with the funny smile? She looks at him, wide-eyed, playing up to her image as the dizzy blonde. In fact she knows exactly who Da Vinci is, and MORSHEAD is tactful enough to acknowledge it gracefully.Do you have that one here too?Really?Look, Colin. COLIN kneels at her side.I sure never had a dolls' house like this when I was a kid. She sees a perfect doll family inside, husband, wife and two children. She points at them, her eyes shining.This is me, that's you, and these are our kids. She smiles wistfully and puts her hand on his arm.Our daughter's so pretty. All little girls should be told how pretty they are. They should grow up knowing how much their mother loves them. Her eyes fill with sadness for a moment.We look like such a happy family, don't we?Shall I be \"her\"? She jumps up onto a step and strikes a pose - hip out, shoulders back, bosom thrust forward, the classic Marilyn \"look\". The delighted crowd bursts into cheers. COLIN stands proudly nearby, content to watch Marilyn being a star, basking in the certain knowledge that she will be leaving with him. One of the spectators turns to him.This isn't a school, it's a palace! COLIN smiles.It's like walking through history.Whipped?I'd never send my kids away. How long were you here?Why?It seems to me that you've had most things pretty easy.So how are you going to do it?Sounds pretty good to me. She smiles warmly, liking him a lot more for his openness. We sense their relationship has moved quietly to a different and deeper level. But before either of them can say anything a SCHOOLBOY turns the corner in his Eton uniform.Work hard, boys! I don't want anyone whipping you! A gawky young teenager near the front shouts out cheekily.Hurry up, slow poke.Oh my gosh! It's freezing!This is great.Don't worry. Roger will fix it. Oh, darn it... She holds her head and he looks at her with concern.I have something in my eye. He swims across to her, very aware of her naked body under the water. She holds her head up to him.Get closer. She tips her head back. He looks deep into her eyes - and suddenly she grabs him and kisses him on the lips. Before he can respond she laughs playfully and swims away.That's the first time I've kissed anyone younger than me. There's a lot of older guys in Hollywood. She swims happily, totally relaxed. COLIN is much more self- conscious, keeping one nervous eye open for pleasure boats. Finally she swims back into the shallows and wades to the shore. She glances back, catching Colin looking. He glances away, embarrassed.Don't be shy, Colin. It's nothing you haven't seen before. COLIN wades awkwardly to the shore, trying to conceal his erection with his cupped hands. MARILYN giggles.Oh, Colin! And you an old Etonian! He grins. She reaches for her blouse and stands shivering as she tries to dry herself. COLIN goes to take her in his arms.Don't spoil it. She looks at him, her expression knowing but sweet.I want this to be the perfect date. He tries to kiss her but she ducks her head away gently, her expression wistful.I haven't had a real date since I was 13 years old. She suddenly looks much younger, her smile a poignant echo of a lost childhood. He steps back politely, allowing her to put on her blouse. As she buttons it, she gazes at him, then impulsively leans forward to kiss him chastely on the lips. The kiss is as sweet and innocent as any 13 year old might wish. The kiss lasts for a few seconds, their lips touching gently, the river shimmering magically in the sunshine behind them. When they finally break apart she rewards him with a radiant smile.That was nice. I don't get kissed much. She looks wistful for a second but quickly brightens.Okay, what do we do now? COLIN looks at her, knowing it is time to return to the real world but reluctant to face it. There is a discreet cough and ROGER appears.Hi Milton. She smiles sweetly.Next time I come on set, you better make sure Colin is there. He looks at her in shock then bitterly at COLIN.Oh hi, Colin.Phooey. She pats the sheets at her side and settles down sleepily on the pillow.Get in. She is instantly back asleep. COLIN fumbles his way to the door. He searches for the key on the side table and quickly finds it. He goes to unlock the door, but then pauses, looking back at Marilyn. He puts the key back and bends down to whisper at the keyhole.Colin? What are you doing here? MARILYN sits up, the sheet clutched to her chest, her expression panicky and disoriented. COLIN hurls himself off the bed.The window? Is there a balcony, like in Romeo And Juliet? How romantic. But I'm not sick. What makes them think that? She reaches instinctively for the pill container on her bedside table.My mom. Her expression softens as she looks at the picture.They took her to the Sanatorium when I was a kid. I grew up in other people's homes, mostly. Alongside her mother's photo is another framed picture, this time of Abraham Lincoln. COLIN frowns.I don't know who my father is so it might as well be him. Why not? I can pick any father I want. She smiles, then looks at Colin wistfully.Do you have a home, Colin? A real one?And a mother and father who still live together?And do they love you?You're lucky. Her eyes fill with tears. She looks up at him anxiously.Do you love me, Colin? He stares at her. She looks lovely but desperately vulnerable.I'm not Greek. She smiles, teasing him. He smiles back. She takes his hand, looking at him in appeal.I don't want to be a Goddess. I just want to be loved like an ordinary girl.I found his notebook. It said I'd let him down.He wanted me to find it. It said he should never have married me. That I was unpredictable and a woman-child, flighty and self- centred. He's left me, Colin. Why do the people I love always leave me? She looks so wretched, so completely baffled, that COLIN responds with sudden passion.All people ever see is Marilyn Monroe. As soon as they realise I'm not her, they run. He lies down next to her, taking her awkwardly in his arms. She sighs sleepily.Boy, there's a lot of men in this business. And they all think you've got to sleep with them. She looks across at him, their faces inches apart.You're not like that. That's why I like you. COLIN stares back at her guiltily. She smiles.You should date that Wardrobe lady. She's pretty.What's the matter? Don't you want to make love?Okay. Friends. She wraps herself around him, curling up so their bodies cradle each other like spoons in a cutlery draw. As she buries her head in his neck he feels her breasts against his back. She curls against him.This is nice. Like spoons. I used to do this with Johnny.Johnny Hyde. My agent, back in the old days. He was thin, like you... Her voice is blurred and drifting with sleep. With her body warm against him COLIN's resolve nearly snaps but he is clear eyed now and determined.\"I found a dream and lay in your arms the whole night through... I'm yours no matter what others may say or do... She has never sounded so happy or carefree. COLIN smiles.\"What? Oh, go away, you silly man.\"\"Well, it's her own fault. She has no right being out at this time of night. She's 93!\" MARILYN is utterly adorable. The crew, COLIN, amongst them, can't take their eyes off her. OLIVIER glances at ORTON behind the camera. They have a good take and they know it.You think I can act, don't you, Colin?I want him to stay with me.I'm so tired of feeling scared. Life is so shitty. I hate it. It hurts too much. COLIN looks at her, his heart breaking at her anguish.Good old Colin. Looking after me, looking after Larry, looking after Vivien. Always putting everyone before yourself. There is an edge to this. He gazes at her, shaken, but she smiles and touches his face gently. He gets on the bed, fully clothed, to fold her in his arms.It hurts! It hurts, Colin! She is doubled up, clutching her stomach, sweating and frightened. COLIN sees a dark red stain on the sheets.The baby. I can't lose the baby. COLIN looks at her aghast.It's a surprise. For Arthur. Don't tell anyone. Promise me. He hurls himself off the bed and runs to the door.We have to say goodbye now, Colin. Arthur's on his way back. When this film is over I'm going to settle down and be a good wife to him. I'm going to learn to make Matzo ball soup as good as his dad's. She smiles wistfully at the fantasy.We have to forget this ever happened.What do you want to do? Marry me?This is what I've worked for my whole life. I couldn't just give it all up.You think I'm crazy?I am happy. I got everything I ever dreamed about. She smiles tentatively, but he sees a terrible fear in her eyes. He looks down, realising with a cruel stab of pain that Olivier was right. There is no way back. She doesn't want to be rescued. He finally looks up, smiling despite the tears in his eyes.Well, maybe just a wink. Once in a while. He smiles, looks at her just once more, and then goes out. As the door closes we see Marilyn's smile fade to be replaced by a bleak, frightened expression.I hope you will all forgive me. It wasn't altogether my fault. I have been ill. She smiles up at their uneasy expressions, struggling to understand herself and their expectations of her.I'd like you to remember I tried. This oddly moving and open confession is received in silence. No one quite knows how to react to her lacerating honesty. Perhaps they think it is just another performance.\"..I found a dream and lay in your arms the whole night through, I'm yours no matter what others may say or do. Be light of heart and fancy free, that's the way to start, there will be nothing to lose till you lose your heart..\" She sings with touching delicacy, nailing it perfectly. There is pin drop silence on the set as the crew watch. COLIN is amongst them. It is a moment of almost unbearable poignancy for him. He suddenly realises that SYBIL THORNDIKE has crept up silently behind him to watch the scene. As he turns to her she smiles with infinite wisdom and compassion, murmuring softly so that only he can hear.\"I've got a solemn word of warning for you.\"\"You know what's going to happen? I'm going to fall in love with you, because I always, always do.\" CLOSE on MARILYN as she smiles, her face radiating joy and vitality. And then, in the split second before ORTON calls `cut', MARILYN turns her head just a fraction and winks at Colin. He grins. OLIVIER looks up from the sofa, notices and smiles indulgently.Buy a girl a drink? COLIN doesn't turn. He recognizes the voice and smiles.I didn't want to leave without saying goodbye.The first time you saw this, all I had on was the radio. Colin opens the package. It's her copy of the script.
