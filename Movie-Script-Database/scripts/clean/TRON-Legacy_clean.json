Did you get a trace on him?!Get the system back up! Now! Move!Um. X-Net was just breached by a hacker.System's back up, no permanent damage, but... But whoever's behind this, they're good, and they're still out there.System is stable again, keep you fingers crossed.Don't ask.What's she doing here? This is an operations meeting.There was never anything between us.She's Advanced Projects. This has nothing to do with her.This creep's the best I've ever seen. He crosses platforms, cracks 128 bit encryption, cloaks every move, never leaves a trace.We can't win playing defense. And it's a bigger job than just swatting an intruder program. Somewhere, there's a human mind behind this thing. We have to get to that User and shut him - or her - down, or the game never ends.20 guys for 20 days -Somebody going to tell me what I've been volunteered for?You didn't pick this up at Circuit City. What is it?That's... Not possible.You mean the urban legends? A computer sucked Flynn into cyberspace a long time ago.I was never told how he died. It was all just weird, you know, because Flynn's the guy who hired me. But he was strange, kept to himself, I didn't know what job I was supposed to be doing. Then you came onboard, the company woke up, we had a direction. It was kind of pathetic, because by the time Flynn died, everybody was too busy to care.You want her to send me into cyberspace to catch that jerk who hacked us?You can bring me back okay?I won't let you down. Let's do it.You're a piece of work. You dumped me because you said I was too much about the company's needs and not enough about yours. Well here we are, the company needs their best guy, and you just can't admit how much to hurts to nominate me.Oh. So you think I have a heart?I promise.What's happening?!It's the Intruder again!DO IT!It's YOU! The intruder!You are... TRON?!?ARRRGHH!Uh, well, I'm not exactly -Yow. I know who programmed you.Mega. Cool. I am -I'm a User.No wait, look. We're on the same side here. I got an ID on the intruder!My name is Rush. I'm a - Look, I got an ID on the Intruder. Do you know the program they used to call Tron?Exactly. That's how he's getting past you. You don't see him for what he is. He's one of your own, gone bad. Tron was a crude security program from Encom's old days. Strictly low-rez, right? Archived and forgotten. But his source code contains all the architecture of every Encom system, including X-net.That's why some smart User dusted him off and upgraded him -People. Like me. From the outside. People who write all of your instructions.How do we contact Sinclair? He'll explain.You don't know? Oh geez. There must be a way to link him into this.He's your boss. Everybody's boss. Outside, in the real world.Okay. Sorry. I'm a program, guess I got a piece of my code corrupted. Whatever it is, it's given me power over Tron. They saw me read his circuits. Can any other program do that?Yeah, I'm a little unstable. But I can find Tron for you.I need to find a program called KROD. He's a specialist in pattern recognition. He snagged the last known position on Tron for me.Plexor ordered us to work together. You can't doubt his instructions, right?Meg for sure programmed you.Never mind. I'm being random.X-Net is amazing. It's going to change everything. Unless one rogue program called Tron brings it down. Do you believe he could?So we're working together on this?What a dump.Hey. Interface.It's gotta be -Krod!The best pattern recognition program ever. This guy can filter a river of junk data and pull out the good stuff.Miles - I mean Krod, you flew the search engine. You ran a trace on a hotshot lightcycle rider. The red guy. Remember?Hang on.Remember, Krod? You were watching this lightcycle duel, a red guy and a green guy, head-to-head.The green guy faked out the red guy, but the red guy double-faked the green guy.Where did the red guy go after that? You didn't crash right away.Did you jack his coordinate?Call me Rush.It's complicated. You're coming with us to the old game grid. We're going to find Tron and shut him down.How do I uplink to the real world?Right... But how did those poor misguided fools boot up the link?I identified the intruder.I have a plan to crash Tron.Hey! Double points if you nail me! Bring it on!Stop! End your routine!Cease! Desist! We're on the same team!I'm X-Net too!No, hey, hey big guy, don't take it so hard. We all have bad days.D-Rezz, we can use a guy with your raw power. You ready to be a hero for X-Net?Let's get to the game grid.When do I get a shot at hacking your code?You act like I've got a virus.The place we nail Tron.D-rezz. Cut a path.Relax, buddy -He's wireless.Hang on. I-Beem. We're from X-Net CPU. You're doing a great job out here. Everybody knows it.That's right. Now, have you seen a rogue Program around here? He's red. Super fast. Known as \"Tron\".When did he come through last?I-beem, we've got a plan to shut down that red violator. You're going to help us.First, you've got to let us onto the game grid.There's bits of Tron's code all over. Krod, give D-Rezz and I-beem the escape coordinate Tron used on me.That's where Tron will bail out. We'll make sure he needs to. Go set up the trap. You only get one shot at this, big guy. Stop him but don't destroy him, right? He's got data I need.He can't resist a grudge match. He'll take risks trying to beat me. That's how we trip him up. Whip it out.Hang on, Krod.I upgraded my unit.Any sign of him?Krod, snap out of it.Look.Remember the plan, Krod. Don't bail out until the last millisecond.Hang on tight, Mega.Wuss! You call that speed!?WHY DID YOU DO THAT?!We've got him now. Let's go!What is it?Stop. Listen to me. You might not believe there's a world outside of this one, but let's just say a guy named Sinclair is depending on me. If Tron got through here, then I can too. Who's with me?Good. I-beem, take D-rezz, see what's up ahead. We'll guard this portal until you come back.Better show me how to use mine.\"All glitches and bad data.\" What's up with you? Ever since I got here, you've been working against me.Blah blah blah. You've got you own processor. I can feel it working overtime. Did Meg program you to mess with me?First, you don't want to come with me, then you're all over me on the light cycle - so you can dump us over and blow the plan. We would have nailed Tron by now if it wasn't for you. What's your malfunction?It's what I'm programmed to do.Nothing. She had a glitch. I was just pinging her EPROM.We've got him now.Guys! Go around - behind Tron!Ouch!Hey! Pick on somebody your own size!You've got no data on me.D-rezz, pull me up!Hang on, man! HANG ON!NOOOO!I know who you are. Encom security program Tr856 - TRON!Who is your User??Who programmed you?? I know your encryption code. Tell me your User or I shut you down.I can shut you down with a nine digit code. WHO IS YOUR USER?? 392 -Tell me, Tron! Who programmed you? Here's your encryption code! 3-6-2- 6-6-8 -ARRGGHHH! 3-6-2-6-6-8-7 -362668766!It's more than I wanted. Now I'll never know who his User is.Where is Mega?MEGA??Mega...I-beem, go for help. Zap your butt out of here.Yeah, I'm a User. A superior being. The first to enter this realm. And you are - ?Flynn. How can you be here?Yeah, he's a lunatic!Thanks.She's a spy.No wonder I couldn't figure it out. I assumed Tron User was on the outside! If I'd known this, I would blown past him and come straight for you.Flynn never died... Because your Quantum Digitizer worked. That's how you got here... I know - that's how I got here too.I'm only getting started. Man, you were the company joke. Now I see why. You melted down your lab to take this little joyride. You got stuck here so all you can do is wreck other people's hard work.You're paranoid. Who would want you dead?Too many of your brain cells have gotten zapped in here, old man.What are they doing??How long has this been going on?Sinclair never told us about this. X-Net is creating the very terror that makes people want the security of X-net!Sinclair.Sinclair betrayed me.We've got to stop this!We've got to tell people on the outside -Megan Randall sent me. Her User. She fixed your lab and sent me here to take out Tron.What happened to them?Flynn. You think I'm Sinclair's flunky, but I'm not.I'm sorry about Tron.We were just doing a job, we had no way of knowing the truth.Flynn, I was wrong about you. You've been doing the right thing in here. Plexor has to be shut down. Sinclair has to be exposed.Krod and I are ready to help.You don't know me.Trust?! You're the one who's been lying to me the whole time!Hey Krod... Shut down.Hear that, Krod? Never let them get to your weak spot.Hey! Down here!Yes... Where is Mega?Flynn was smart enough to interrogate her first.Yeah, only - We kicked Flynn's butt, too.I'll never let you forget it.Nah, we're cool. We're with them!Drop the disk!ARRGH!Is that all you've got?Mega! Quick! Jump!MEGA!!!I got it, I got it, I got it.Shove it! Go!Check it out!What?They took Mega.How do we attack Plexor next?It's like the forty-sixth level of ConquerDome 6.1, while winning a side game of Tetras Ultra, doing six Instant messages and debugging a demo.I'm there. Krod too.Over there!Can we take out those X-Net guys?It's the encryption pattern on Plexor's disk.Just for laughs, try putting the circle on top of the pyramid.If I'm wrong, ding me.How do we use this thing to shut down Plexor?But once Plexor knows we have it, he'll change the code.Then we should take out the power supply to Plexor's main server.I was inside the main server, I saw how it's laid out.Of course we can.We'll trash X-Net. Then we'll go back to the our world and expose what Sinclair's done.Do they have any idea our world exists? Do they understand what a User is?Or yours.It there a way to contact Meg? She can transport us back to our world. Maybe it's better if we fight Sinclair on his own turf.What do you mean?But... Meg said -Oh, man.Why didn't you tell anyone it was this bad?I thought she hated me.Do we really have a shot at winning against Plexor?Mega... Are you sure about her? I get the feeling she plays both sides.Sounds dangerous.Uhhh, I don't think so.What do I do - ?Yow!It feels... Awesome.Oh man, this is good.Don't take this the wrong way.I hope you're right about Mega.We're all here.We got it.No sweat. OUCH.Let's do it.Keep moving.Krod. You'll do great.Your recognize patterns better than any of us. You'll know Plexor's moves before he does.Yeah man?Flynn and I come from a realm no better or worse than here... One thing I know, neither place works unless you're looking out for the other guy. And we've got a word for what all of you are.Heroes.Go, Meg!Which way to the power supply?!Block this choke point, slow them down. Can you guys do it?We have to get across.You haven't got a chance by yourself.We plug this into the control cell, X-Net is history.NOW!AAARRGGGHHH!Your software has the biggest flaw there is, Plexor. You can't see you own mistakes.Do it Mega!Thanks guys.Whoa, ouch, what? Ahhhhh!Guys! Mega! NOOO!Like a bad cold, I'm always coming back.I met a program you wrote. She's just as incredibly beautiful and confusing as you.She gave you my coordinates. That's how you uploaded me?Flynn!Hey, jerk, she doesn't do your dirty work. Neither do I. Not anymore. You lied to me, to all of us. You want to deal with somebody? I'm the guy who crashed X-Net.Cool.We'll take it.

I remember hiring you.You did everything you could.The day after I hired you, you start sucking up to Sinclair. You thought I didn't know. Bet he offered your a partnership for this, right? You have no idea the damage you've done.Open your eyes, geek. My lab was rigged. My \"death\" was no accident. I pushed the button just in time to escape... Almost in time.The same guy I programmed Tron to shut down. Same one you've been sucking up to. Sinclair. And his cyber-henchman, Plexor.Rush, you lamer! You've been working for the bad guy.Let's move. X-Net goons will soon be all over this place.I hired Sinclair as Encom's business guy, so I could do the dreaming. Right off, he wanted to \"capture the market\" on data transmission. Had this plan called \"X-Net\", based on flawless efficiency, hyperlock security, encryption protocol uniformity. Blah blah. I was the boss, I told him to forget it. I knew it could go bad. But the guy had trouble taking no for an answer. He arranged for my lab to melt down. Sinclair took over my company and put X-Net on a fast-track. And here's where it's brought us.Beating the competition.We've got to choose our battles wisely. This way!For years.No more glitches, freeze-ups or shut- downs. Once X-Net is open, Plexor will destroy all other systems. All data flow will be controlled by his Master User -All data flow - Sinclair's to control and abuse. Bank accounts, medical histories, your Blockbuster account, your buying patterns, your e-mail. And to think, Rush - all this time, you've been working 24/7, trying to impress a him.Finally you get it.They didn't see us. Keep moving!Plexor shut down all the I/O ports. Only HE communicates with the outside. Sinclair holds all the cards.How did you get here?!Megan Randall? I remember her. Smart, wise beyond her years. I can't believe she'd fall for Sinclair's lies.Lock up these two. We'll hold them for ransom. Or use them for target practice.Mega, what do you read in him?Mega's been risking her existence for our cause, lamer. That's more than you'll ever do. Lock them away!If X-Net is allowed to open it's the beginning of the end of a free and open cyberspace. We can't let Plexor get away with this. Our game plan has not changed. Tron was specially programmed to break into X-Net and shut down power supplies. We would then exploit these weak points and cripple the system. Tron's role was essential One of you must take his place.Who among you can power Tron's disk and carry out his mission?It's the most dangerous job. If you're not up for it, nobody's going to blame you.It's futile. Plexor's personal defense measures are massive.Retreat! Over that way! Move around their flank!Arrrgghhh!I'm not leaving you with this phreak.Plexor, get over the control thing.I'll be damned.Rush! This way!He's been sent for a reason.Don't know yet. Sometimes we have to trust the bigger plan.TURN AROUND!She can handle herself for a while.All at the same time.We're going to need all the help we can get. Boole, can we make it to the dark zone from here?We'll meet up with the code monkeys and combine forces.Our forces are too thin. We can't risk a battle that would reveal this position.BT! JR!Good to see you guys. When did the X-Net goons start patrolling all the way out here?Hey guys. This is Rush and his main man Krod. They defected from Plexor's forces to fight with us.Excellent. Let's see.Good eyes. We've got Mole Programs who score chunks of Plexor's personal code anywhere they can find it. These guys fit the pieces together.It can take a quadrillion combinations.How many of you crashed?The Teraflop Boys? Algebrat?Oh Geez.Time is running out!What have we got to lose? Try it.Not bad.It's a copy of Plexor's master key. We can break into any X-Net facility and fry the power supply.Yep. We've got one shot.Hang on, guys, that's not as easy as it sounds -Even with this key, it won't -Hey, the future depends on us. How could we fail?It's a bummer being on the losing team, huh Rush?Programs once connected freely with their Users. But Plexor shut down the I/O ports, severing all links. He controls all contact with the world we once knew. Programs operate on his instructions or none at all.It's nothing to brag about. We're getting our butts kicked.I gave up the idea of going back a long time ago... You should too.Sinclair didn't get where he is by being dumb. Even if we survive Plexor's forces in here, Sinclair will make sure we never get back home.I'm sure she'll do everything she can. It might not be enough.Rush. I think Meg suspects the truth about Sinclair.That's why she sent you here. She knew you're the one guy who could find out.She believed in you more than you believed in yourself.We have his master key. And we have Mega working on the inside.Plexor programmed her to perform his will. He's a control freak. I'm not. I programmed her to have a will of her own. Whatever she decides, it's up to her.Sometimes you've got to trust the bigger plan.Guys... Rush is right about our final attack. If we've only got one shot, we should go for Plexor's central server. If we insert the hologon key in the main power supply, we can trigger a meltdown. Plexor will be have his best troops standing in our way.Getting past them was the ultimate task I programmed Tron to carry out.I turbo-charged him to burn hot and burn fast. Who else could handle the operating code in this disk?You.Steady. It's all about giving as much as you get. Let it become a part of you.Damn, look at that... He did it.Don't flinch, Rush! It's your disk now.Rush, up there. See it?This is all yours, Rush.Go! Quick!Something's up.The sooner Rush gets this into the main power supply, the sooner X-Net shuts down. And the more of us come out of here to tell about it.I'm proud of you, Mega.ARRGGHH!There. You can make it across!No, take Mega! I'll stay here and run interference.Ah, these guys are wimps.My body is weak, but my will is strong. I promise, no matter what they do to me, I'll survive this. Trust the bigger plan.GO! NOW!Freedom, Plexor. It's the better idea. That's why Mega chose my side.Crash me. Hack me. Do what you want. The yearning for freedom will last forever.I told you to trust the bigger plan.You picked the right guy to send in.Speak for yourself, Sinclair.No, Sinclair. I'm back. And I'm the boss again. You're fired. Not only are you fired, you're going to have a lot of explaining to do to the SEC, the Justice Department and the FBI. Hold him until the police get here.X-Net is dead. But Encom lives.
