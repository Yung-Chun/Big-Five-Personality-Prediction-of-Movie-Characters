Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.Evil begets evil, Mr. President. Shooting would only make it stronger.Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.The most terrible intelligence imaginable, Mr. President.We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.Yes..thank God..The Mondoshawans don't belong to the Federated Territories, but they are peaceful... in their possession are the four elements of life. These elements when they are gathered around a fifth: The Supreme Being, ultimate warrior, created to protect life........will produce what the ancients called the light of creation, the light of total goodness which is the only thing that can defeat EVIL.White turns to black. Light to Dark. Life to Death. For all eternity.They are the only ones who can help..Thank you, Mr. President.We are lost!What are we going to do?Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.That's me. But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?The fifth element.Who are you?The girl?He's a she!There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it! This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..It's a miracle!!!I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!Appipulai Leeloo Minai..At your service.Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!She's an exception..Thank you so much for your help Mr...?Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.It means, \"Never without my permission\".Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.What're you laughing about?Yes. Of course..Leeloo..I'm sorry to interrupt you but..The case..with the stones... Where is it?The case was stolen?Who in gods name would do such a thing?There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...Perfect.Leeloo? The Stones... We must get them back.You know exactly where they are!What do you mean empty?She says that the Guardians never really had much faith in humans. They were afraid of being attacked. The stones were given to someone they could trust who took another route. She's supposed to contact this person in a little less than twelve hours from now in a hotel. She's looking for the address!...We're saved!Good work, my son. Now all we need is a way to get there.I'll get it. Finish your work my son.My son?Mr. Who?I remember you now..the so called art dealer....Why on earth do the stones interest you?Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you....I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.No thank you.They are robots!Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.Where's the robot to pat your back?Can I give you a hand?You are a monster, Zorg!I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..We have to save the world.Of course.Oh my god oh my god..What are you doing?No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.Leeloo, be careful.Did you get them?Excellent... Leeloo Dallas.And Korben David Dallas.I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.He'll protect you. Go on... See the Diva... get the Stones... See you at the temple... God be with you.I feel so guilty sending her to do the dirty work. I know she was made to be strong but she's also so fragile... So human. You know what I mean?Yeah...Where's Leeloo?It's all my fault. I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!Here's the key to the Temple.. Prepare for our arrival!Where was I?And the smile of an angel?May I speak to you alone....My God!Mangalores! The Diva's suite! They want the Sacred Stones! They must be stopped. We must stop them!. I'm going to free you but you must promise to help me!I told you...Of course I was telling you the truth!... If you had listened to me in the first place, we wouldn't be in this predicament now!You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.Leeloo's in trouble?Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?Probably the time remaining before it explodes.Doesn't matter all you need are your legs.There's a General on the phone... His name's Mambo, I think.Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!Uh, this one... must be water!Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.That's what I'm saying.Come on Leeloo!

You all right?I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly..Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.Ma.. it's the door. I'll call you back.What mission?Where have I heard this song before?Just one... why me?And the third one?I've had enough good news for todayYou rigged the contest?You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?I'm not going.One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive....Scuse me....Shit!It's my wife.I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished. She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please......Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.Oh, yes you will......Coming!I suppose that means \"Hi\" ?Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?What kind of mission?Good luck..Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.I'm sorry..Leeloo, hide in here and don't move!Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.No, I'm a meat popsicle.Wrong answer.I'm really sorry.. there wasn't time.Here let me wrap you up...It's funny.

You'll see, honey's great!...A hot cup of coffee... with honey...I've got this great honey somewhere. You know about honey? There used to be these little animals who made it with antenna.....and these other animals who ate it.. one were bees the other were bears..I forget which ate it and which made it but..Here it is!Taste this...It... melts in your mouth, doesn't it?You hear that?Oh god!I'm really sorry.. let me help you..What?Jesus!... Some priest!Yeah?...Not yet.I'll take the mission.Hey! I really thought I was going to miss my flight! Thanks, kid! You put the luggage on the conveyor belt?Great! Now beat it!Excuse me. I was so afraid I'd miss the flight that I sent the kid here to pick up my boarding card....My cousin David...Uh, yes... Newlyweds. You know how it is... Love at first sight. You meet, something goes tilt,. you get married, you hardly know each other. Right, darling?Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you. It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.Listen... I don't want to be interviewed. I'd prefer to remain anonymous.You gotta be kidding!...Hi.Uh... not really.I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...Leeloo, listen to me... these tickets... they're not mine... I mean they are, but not for vacation like everyone thinks... I'm on an operation... and if I didn't come get you, you'd be in a shitload of trouble... I'd love to be on vacation with you... but now.... now I've got to work... And Leeloo... I would love to work in peace.Yes! But \"love\" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..Know what? On that subject maybe you'd be better off asking the screen.Finished what?Which one?You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!I know how to say \"Hello\". Teach me how to say \"Good-bye\", that's all I need.Apipoussan?Uh...Help...Pardon me. Excuse me. I'm trying to reach my wife.. Sorry!I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.I don't think this is a good time...Yeah, very big, a giant.For the concert it says formal attire... I didn't bring...Hello?...Ma???...Ma!!!Listen, Ma! I've only got a few days vacation and I'll be damned if I'm gonna spend them on the phone....Hang on, it's the door. No! I told you I didn't bring anybody! I'm all alone... as usual!...I'll call you back.Here we go again...You get that off the screen?You noticed..Where you going?No, not at all! I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!I have an idea.I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.It's difficult.Army issue. I'm sorry.The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.No..to all of the above.I was sent by the government to help you.I've never heard anything so beautiful in my life.Who?Leeloo... is... she's......So Cornelius was telling the truth!...Yeah, so am I.I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.You tell me to save the world then you go off and leave me in the shit!Come on! You're not gonna die in peace! You're not going to die at all! You hear me? Where are the Stones?I'm sorry, but... the Stones......The Stones are with me?...In me?That's it... I've had... all day people have been sticking guns in my face...You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?Everybody down!Toss me the balls!The balls for Christ's sake!How far is he from here?Forget it.Leeloo???The winner of the Gemini Croquette contest.Seven to the left. Five to the right.Six to the left. One to the right.We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.Found him...Mind if I go? I'm an excellent negotiator.Anyone else want to negotiate?Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.When is she not in trouble?Leeloo?A molecular bomb.Not without Leeloo.It's the latest model.. I've never seen one before... it works off a magnetic coded card... Let's see if I can rig it up.Don't worry, I'm here now!Just relax. I've got the Stones. Everything's going to be fine.I'll be right back.Don't you know how to count. It's not all that hard. Watch!One! That's for trying to kill me!Two! That's for firing me! Three! That's for pushing around a priest! And the rest is for what you did to my wife!We're outta here!It's like a cab isn't it?Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?Found it?Fuck it! Hold tight!Solid little jobs, aren't they?Apipoulai..Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?I told you not to read all that crap!So now what's the problem?How much time before the collision?I'll call you back in two hours.Excuse me, Father, but... could we pray later?Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?Match the symbols!No. It's much simpler. If we don't figure out where these Stones go in five minutes, we're all dead! Think you got it?There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.The rain falls... the wind blows?Try and figure out how this fucking thing opens, instead of staring at me like that!What did you say? What did you do?Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!Is that all?The wind! The wind blows...Quickly, everyone on a Stone! Water for water! Fire for fire! Earth for earth!Don't breathe.It's up to you now, Angel!You can sleep tomorrow... come on...Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it!Leeloo! If you don't get on with the program we're all gonna die! And that's not on my agenda for today.You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...Exactly.Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine!

It's the ideal weapon for quick, discreet interventions. A word on fire power: Titanium recharger. 3000 round clip with bursts of 3 to 300. With the replay button, another Zorg innovation, it's even easier... one shot.... and replay sends every following shot to the same location...I recharge, but the enemy has launched a cowardly sneak attack from behind, the automirror takes care of that.

Not two or three! But four!!! Four stones!!! What the fuck am I supposed to do with an EMPTY case?!!But you can still count. Look... my fingers....Four stones, four crates... Zero stones...So, you are a merchant, after all. Leave them one crate. For the cause!I don't like warriors! They're too narrow-minded, no sublety. Worse, they fight for hopeless causes..for honor! Honor has killed millions of people but hasn't saved a single one. You know what -- do I like though, I like killer. A real dyed in the wool killer. Cold-blooded. Clean. Methodical. Thorough.

Look at this empty glass.Here it is... peaceful... serene... but if it is...Destroyed......Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color. So full of..life!Yes but... by that simple gesture of destruction. I gave work to at least fifty people today. The engineers, the technicians, the mechanics. Fifty people who will be able to feed their children so they can grow up big and strong. Children who will have children of their own, adding to the great cycle of life!Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life! So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.You saved my life... So, I'm going to spare yours. Throw him out!I know......Torture whoever you want, the president if you have to but I want those Stones.

My man.Korben sweetheart do me a favor I know this is probably the biggest thing that ever happened to you in your inconsequential life. But I've got a show to do here and it's got to pop. So tomorrow, when we're on air, give me a hand... Try to make believe you have more than a one word vocabulary. OK pal?Crystal.I don't want an individual position, I want all positions!Now you're talking!No!! I swear to God! I've never been this sincere with a human before!My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams......You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?I didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him. 50 billion people listen to me every day... and he doesn't hear me...Hey Stud we gotta...Korben my man what's happening here? Who's the chick? What's the gig? We free forming here? Getting funky with the monkey? Can I get in on this?We have just walked into what is probably the most beautiful concert hall in the universe. Totally awesome! Magnificent paintings on the ceiling. I don't know who painted them, but he must have busted his balls! I see a row of former ministers, more sinister than minister! A few generals practicing how to sleep. And there's Baby Ray, star of stage and screen, drowning in a sea of nymphets. He's not gonna get much out of this concert, he's stone-deaf!...And over there is Roy Von Bacon, the king of laserball and the best paid player in the League. ...And over there is the Emperor Kodar Japhet whose daughter Aachen is still at the bar. \"I love to sing, too, but in the shower\", she recently confessed to me. She will no doubt prove to be as generous tonight as she always is.Ladies and gentlemen, I think we're being... attacked. The place is crawling with warriors.They're hideous. They've got a crest on the head, the eyes of a toad and fingers all over their hands. Totally hideous!Don't you think we'd better be going?Korben man... These dudes are going to waste us if we don't do what they say.Got it...This is amazing! Korben, Korben Dallas, the winner of the Gemini Croquette contest just killed three warriors like he was swatting flies...It's Roy von Bacon, the Lions center forward joining in the battle...GET OFF MY BACK!...And our man Korben has literally knocked out the opposition with an amazing 90 foot pitch.He's on vacation.Korben man... what the hell is this?And, uh, what're these numbers clicking by?You're just saying that to scare me! Right? If it was a bomb, an alarm would've gone off. There's bomb detectors in all these hotels!Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?Like D-Man, I hate to bother you but uh, like, we're down to 2 minutes here...Hey! What are you doing? The bomb!Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?Are you nuts, Father? That hurts! I can't feel my teeth.You know how to fly this thing?I don't even know what I'm looking for!Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.The best show I ever did!What is this some kinda game? Like chess?I'm looking, I'm looking....we'll never make it.It... it moved! Korben! Korben!Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!I was like this... With my hands here and... I said, \"We'll never make it!\" That's all!Yeah... then I sighed... like this.I don't have a light. I stopped smoking last week! If we'd come a bit sooner...This guy is a killer with the babes.
