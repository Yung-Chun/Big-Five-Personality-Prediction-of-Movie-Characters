One for one.\"Did you ever see Francis-8?Well...you can't have them all.You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him -Want me to take your shift? I'm feeling restless anywayNow there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.Looks like I'm working.Who invited you?Runner terminated 0:31 Ready for cleanup.That was a great shot you made.What's wrong, Available?Please . . . no ? You mean \"not here\"--that's it? You're a private Available but particular, Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.You prefer women?Well then...?Sad? What made you sad?Yes...probably he was renewed?Killed? Why do you use that word?I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners Who brought you?You felt sad. What's your name?You're beautiful. Let's have sex.Later.But you put yourself on the circuit!And?And now?About what?Let's have sex. I thought you were curious.I'm listening.I'm not armed. Well?You shouldn't even think such things... And you picked a strange person to say them to -So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.When this turns black...that's it. If for any reason you want to be 31... you have the same chance as everyone else...Carrousel.You're years away . . . I don't know why you're thinking of these things, much less talking about them. Want to try?What Quad do you live in?It's nice to know you can nod.It's nice co know you can do that, too.What happened to you?How come?Get yourself a new face while you're at it They know you now.I just might look in on New You 483 myself.No -- it's that last Runner -- someone in 483 was trying to help him.Negative. Question: What is it?Negative.I don't understand?Question:1056 unaccounted for?!Impossible! Question: Maybe they weren't all Runners. Maybe most of them reached Life Renewal on Carousel.Question: None of them reached renewal?But everyone believes that some....Question: You mean nobody's ever been renewed?I will.Question: What if I need help from another Sandman?Question: I am six Red...how can I pretend to be approaching Lastday?My Lifeclock... Question: My Life--Question: Am I still six Red?Did you ever see anybody renew?Did you?Anybody we know?I'm fine.... See you....Location...female Green Six... name Jessica...living in Quad K.She has.But I wasn't sure you'd come.I couldn't get you out of my mind.Maybe...sure....Of course.You knowAll right.I'm going to run.You know something.Both...running's what I'm interested in.It's different now. Help me.A Runner gave it to me.I let him go...believe me.I don't have much time.What can I do to make you believe me?Are you here to help me?That's tomorrow.Maybe you'll chink of something...If you did know, you'd tell me.Tell me, Jessica.A Runner...Cathedral. A woman.Have you ever been through Cathedral?They're like beasts. Wild.Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.Uh-uh.When did you begin to question Lastday?Let me go first. Sometimes they're waiting just inside there--to rush you when it opens...Quickly now--It's unauthorized. No good for any- one over thirteen anyhow--shakes you to pieces--speeds everything up to a blur-- you can see what happens when some flying Cub tries to go through this on muscle--splat!Not here. Might be a decoy.Runner!I'm a Sandman!No, for you! How old are you, Billy?Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months? What happens when you're sixteen and you go green?No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here. If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!All right! How many of you want this to be Lastday?!Come on, Billy...come on...you cut a Sandman, didn't you?!Come on, Billy...cut me...Come onThey've got someone else! Why would anybody come here?Sanctuary? Anything?If they find you throw this hard enough to break it. Then hold your breath till you get away...It's blind gas.Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?Then - why don't you leave me - go to them - explainAll right. New You 483. I'll find out myself.Hello.It's all right with me. Is he here?No - Look, I'm in a hurry.Just one.Thanks. I thought you'd be older. I ex- pected a Red.Your own work?Just the face.Do I have to undress?I don't care...Just get it over with.Holly'd like dark hair.No - I'm Running!It has nothing to do with you.Are you taking me to them?Because he's my friend - and I don't want to be killed by him - or anyone.Will he find us and kill us? Yes...or one of the others. You know there's only one place to go now...I'd rather take my chances with them...than with Francis.I'm a runner. She brought me here because I begged her to help me.Yes I have. Now it's my turn. And I want to live.May we move?I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.I Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back. Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.Why, Jessica? You're still a green.Come on then--they'll be here any minute!Wait - I have the one I took from the Runner.It's the only way.Some kind of breeding pens...I suppose...They say people used to breed animal s, fish, anything To eat, of course.It's brighter there...besides, we can't go back.It doesn't make any difference anymore.You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you? Why did you stay with me?I had to. I did kill...for the first time in my life I killed.I guess so...I know I felt something I never felt before...and I didn't like it...not a bit. I'll tell you one thing...Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.All right - what are you?This place is a link to Sanctuary, isn't it?We were sent here and you know it. Others have been sent here. Where are they? Hiding?Where do we go?! Where do we go from here??!!You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.Where do you send them?That's better. How do you want us?How do you want us?All right. Now you keep your bargain.What other food?Tell us how to get out...or I\u00b9ll destroy you..I'll kill you!It seems to be moving away. Come on...It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.Jessica -- we must be outside!Sooner or later, we'll have to try somethingThey're good.Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.I doubt it.I won't.It all seemed to make sense until Box.You're right...it must be near now. We'll find it.Of course.I have never seen a face like that before. It must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?How old are you?Your hair is white.Is that what they're called-- cats?How long have you been living here?What kind of place is this?How did you get here?Are there any other humans?Have any other people ever passed through?What makes you think so?Where are they?No--I'm sorry. It's not possible.I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.What's beyond this place - do you know?Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest.That sweet madman -- how could he Come to exist?One in a million, I supposeThere's nothing to go on to, Jessica.You want there to be one...that Doesn't...That's the same fellow who's outside. If he was so important - why isn't he first?Look at your palm, Francis.... look! It's clear. Clear!I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that....Not yet.What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and--Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!I know...I know...We're leaving.To a city with thousands and thousands of people.More...many more.I promise. We '11 go on as soon as it's light.Thank you. Tell me - what do those words mean? \"Beloved husband\u00b2...\u00b2Beloved son\"... \"Beloved wife\"'...Stay? They lived together all their years?Sanctuary is the right to live.... nothing more. But nothing less, either....It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.Of course. I don't know where... I Just took them for granted. It's our only chance.I'm sorry.Can you make it back?You don't have to die!! No one has to die at thirty!!! You don't have to blink out on Lastday. There's no renewal on Carrousel! You can live longer and grow old... I've seen it. She's seen it!!
