He got some job at some company, giving his uncle hand-jobs.I got us tickets to see Adam tomorrow.Ally, I don't want to go either, but Derek told Adam he'd go, and I'm not going by myself.I wish.I know her.When I was dating Steve, that slut fucked him.She started dating Steve right after we broke up. I mean right after. I asked him if there was another girl, and he never answered. He couldn't answer, because he was fucking that slut.I know what I'm doing.We'll get there.Listen, fuck that slut, okay?! She can fucking rot in hell! I'm not rushing for her slut ass!I-don't-fucking-care!! That slut can kiss my ass! You hear me, you fucking bitch?!Are you seeing anybody else?Hello?!

That little slut.Sorry if I snapped.I mean this morning.I'm just afraid its gonna be the whole thing all over again with Derek, and then I've got to find some other asshole, and do it all again.

I don't wanna be referred to that quack Hengis. I don't trust women doctors.Ally, I'm really feeling something. A deep ache, like someone's crushing me.

He hasn't used condoms with me for weeks.Ally, these are not left-overs. He never used regular condoms with me.Because if he did, he took two fucking days to come. I always made him wear ultra-thin, ribbed, anything but this shit.Ally, I'd be done, and I'd have to lie there like another hour 'till he got off. I couldn't fucking stand it. Why the hell do you think I started on the pill, Ally? Me. Putting that hormone shit in my body.Well that's why. Anyway, that's neither here nor fucking there. That asshole is usingNo, no, fuck that. We're going to go to the party, have some fun. When he's all good and drunk, you're going to ask him when I'm not around.Ally, I'm serious. If he's drunk and having fun, and you just work it in on him real casual, he may slip. He'll never admit shit to me.Ally!

There's not much left.I'm not that kind of girl.That's nasty.Wanna wash your mouth out?My God, Ally.I'm all talk. I can't cheat on Derek. I love Derek. It's just that he makes me so mad.
