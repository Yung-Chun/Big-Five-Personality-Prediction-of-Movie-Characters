{"50-50": {"ADAM": {"raw_line": "I have an appointment.Adam Schwartz.Um, am I supposed to go somewhere?Oh, should I go sit?Yeah, that's me.Do I need to take off all my clothes?I'll figure it out.You don't happen to have anything in a cotton blend?You want me to fill this entire cup.It's gonna take me at least a week to fill this. Can I take it home?Just another minute.Hello? Is anybody out there?I have to pee.It won't turn off.Sorry.What?Really?No! Don't touch it.Hey Andrew.Yo.No.I ran out of shampoo. I had to use Rachel's.Can you unlock my window? There's a lot of pollen in the air.Seriously, my allergies are flaring up. It feels like my nasal cavities are on fire.Rachel and I used to be like that; like two wild animals in heat... I guess it is only natural though, as we get older, more mature, things begin to slow down. Sex every three weeks is normal? Right?You think maybe she's mad cause I haven't asked her to move in?It's not that big a deal.Do you realize how lucky I am to be with Rachel?But they're not Rachel. I don't know how to explain it, but being with her just feels right. And I'm not going to overlook that just cause we're in a lull.It's Rachel's shampoo.We're almost done with Upper Paleolithic.Phil?I should probably get to work.Greg. What are you doing?Where did it come from?Greg you can't just...that's a 75 million year old fossil...just please, put it away before someone sees it.Hey kids.This here is a family of homo sapiens who lived in Europe about 25,000 year's ago......these Cro Magnon's as they're often called, are the closest in the evolutionary chain to modern day humans......What made Cro Magnon so advanced was their sense of community...they were the first to settle on a single plot of land, devote to one partner, raise a family, and take care of the sick.This is Homo Neanderthalensis - the Neanderthal Man. For over 150,000 years his ancestors dominated all of Europe. But then about 30,000 years ago, Neanderthals began to disappear, until one day, their entire civilization was gone.Greg you know what happened.Well no one knows for sure. But it's suspected that because Neanderthal was a nomadic huntsman, he roamed the land, only fending for himself - never learning to cohabitate with others. So as Cro Magnon families settled into Europe, they took over the land. One by one, Neanderthal was pushed out...and never seen, or heard from again.But you never know, just cause they vanished doesn't mean they're gone. For all we know, there could be a Neanderthal walking among us right now. And by the looks of this guy HERE - I'd say he probably plays defense for the Raiders.I have no idea what you just said. Is there something wrong with me?I still have no idea what you're talking about.What?!...A tumor? No.How is that possible?...I don't smoke. I don't drink. I eat healthy...I even recycle.But, look at me. I don't look sick.Can't you just cut it out of me?Well what are my chances of beating this?Can I have just a few more minutes?Nothing.We need to talk.I had a doctor's appointment today.Have you ever seen the movie \"Beaches\"?Yeah that one.Remember the end of \"Beaches\"?I don't know.Well I do know, but I can't pronounce it. Neuroscharnoma or something.It's not good.I just think it's an interesting time to take up smoking again.Sshhhh. Everything's going to be alright Yammy. I'm going to start chemo in a few days. We're going to get through this.Ugh...and my parents are coming over for dinner.No.3...2...1...Hey.Where's dad?Dad, I don't have a cat.It's made of wheat gluten.What is she talking about?Mom. We're not getting married.Have you ever seen \"Terms of Endearment\"?Alright fine. But, before I tell you, you have to promise me you're going to stay calm.Mom, just promise me. Okay?I have cancer.I have cancer.I have cancer.I - HAVE - CANCER.Mom, I have a giant tumor in my spine.Mom?Mom, what are you doing?Please, will you come sit down.Mom, I already have cancer.Mom, please, stop. I don't need these.Mom.It's genetic.The problem is not with my bowels.Thanks dad.What? No. Absolutely not.That's a terrible idea.Mom, I'm fine.It's nothing. Really.I know.What's taking him so long? How hard is it to buy a cup of coffee?We've been here 20 minutes. What's he shopping for a car?Is this really how you want to spend the rest of your life? Wasting away in this place?I don't believe it. Why can't he just get a latte like he does every morning.No we don't have plenty of time! Life is finite.I have cancer.I'm serious.Maybe a little louder, you can make a special announcement.Yesterday. They found a tumor in my spine.What do you mean who?Lewis and Clark...The doctors found it.I'm telling you now.What do you want the Better Friend award? It's not an easy topic to bring up.The bright side of what?I have an appointment with Dr. McRae.You're Dr. McRae?Aren't you supposed to be like sixty-five and wear earth toned sweaters?No, no, no. I was just expecting someone older.No believe me, you're fine. Better than fine, you're Dr. McRae...you're a doctor? How old are you?Twenty-six? What are you like Doogie Howser?Doogie Howser......The teenage doctor.No. Nevermind...but aren't you young to be a doctor?So have you had many patients?Oh.Honestly. I feel fine.Yeah, but I tend to internalize everything so, who knows.Is that what I do?The way I say it sounds cute in a neurotic way. When you say it, it's like an indictment. The word \"repress\" - sounds so harsh.Oh good, I'd hate to think I'm anything but an emotional sheep.So how do we do that?You're not in a cult are you?I don't know, it was a bad joke.Huh?Lay here?Shouldn't we be analyzing my childhood? Or my days as a call girl?Oh come on. Nothing? That was funny.I can't believe you got me a present. Is it that Prada handbag I've been eyeing?What is it?You know how I feel about surprises. Last surprise I got my parents told me I was adopted.Yeah, but sometimes I wish I was.What is it?It's so small. What do you do with it?Why, did it go to medical school?It looks like a gremlin. What happens if you get it wet after midnight?They're a lot of work.I can barely take care of myself, I don't think I can handle another living, breathing, needy, thing in my life.I know what you're doing.Alright. Fine, we can keep the dog.Really.Here I am.No thanks.Yup. The Big C.Nope, this is my real hair.I'm going to miss you too.Excuse me for a moment, I think I see someone over there from a previous life.No, not yet.Ah, okay.Like a specific kind of green food?Schwannoma Neurofibrosarcomas.It's pretty rare.Cancer often has no specific symptoms. People can go years with out knowing they're sick.I think you already said zucchini.Uh huh.Is that legal?Hey Greg.Really?Your uncle had Schwannoma Neurofibrosarcomas.Well that was a nightmare.Half those people don't even know me.What?What?I love you.You are so unbelievably sexy.What?Ignore him.I'll do it after.Come on. Today...If I don't get laid tonight because of you, I'm going to take your little bow and make a noose...Please! I need this.Evening.Will you please just finish.Mother fucker.Do you...want to move in?I was thinking it might be nice, now that I'm not going to work anymore. And with my chemo starting...You're here all the time anyway.You wanna have sex?Hi. Nice to see you.Rabbi Jacobs.Oh you know, just trying to live by the Covenant.I don't like to brag, but I couldn't speak it then.I'm sure she did.Nothing is easy for my mother.Honestly, I'm just here to make my mother happy. It was either this or I had to go see my cousin perform in his high school theatre's adaptation of \"You've Got Mail\".Is he okay?Is that going to happen to me?What if someone sees us?Twenty-five.Not really.I got to tell you, I was really nervous about this whole cancer thing, and then I met you guys, and boy do I feel better.Adam Schwartz, schwannoma neurofibrosarcomas.... man this pot is really strong.I want to ride.I don't have cancer.I feel like I was just gang raped by the Buena Vista Social Club.I'm serious. Have you heard their horn section?I was just injected with three pints of kryptonite. Can we please hold off on the new agey stuff.What I need is for people to stop telling me what I need.They teach you that in medical school?An outlet for what? I have cancer.Well excuse me. You'll have to forgive me for not having a firm handle on my emotions at this particular juncture of my life.I'm sorry, I know you're only trying to help.This is all too much for me. I don't know what to do. Just tell me what to do and I'll do it.Why would we go to Mardi Gras?I'm getting chlamydia just listening to you talk about it.This isn't my bachelor party we're planning here.I'm not going anywhere.What just happened?Are you going to the park again?This is the third time today.He can barely make it to the door without shitting himself.Yeah.It's medicinal.The store. (off Rachel's furiousWhy can't we put up both?Yes?Love you.I don't get it, they spend all day at the dog park.Can you not talk about her like that?She's got some kind of creative block...It's her process.We're going through a rough patch. That's what happens in relationships.We're not going to Mardi Gras.I've been reading your books, and you know it actually makes sense...Some of it.I'm not gonna lie, I don't really get the \"Dark Night of the Soul\" stuff. But I get it, years of anxiety have taken over my body. I'm blocked...emotionally.Sure, if you think it'll help.Just go with it.I, ah, have cancer.My best friend's favorite band is Abba.Fake.She's been really stressed lately,If I brought her here, she'd probably freak out.Hey it's me, just checking to see if you're on your way.It's me again. Just checking to see where you are. In case you're looking for me I'm now on the other side of the parking lot. Call me.Oh hey.Just waiting for Rachel to pick me up.Uh, four.She must be stuck in traffic.I think you should ask for a refund.Yeah, I can see.Nope.Nope. I actually failed my test.It's true.Eh. Let's just say, that the state of California felt it was best I didn't.I kind of backed my mom's car down an embankment...Into the Balboa cactus garden.They didn't want to tow it out in fear of destroying more of the vegetation, so they had to use a giant crane.Stop the car.Just stop the car.I can't handle all this mess.You can drive.Thanks for the ride...Do you want to come in. For a beverage? Or something?Come on, I'll let you analyze my Id.I've never played before.Doesn't mean I play it. Games these days today are so complicated.There's too many buttons. I can't keep track of what does what.She has a sense of humor.Duck Hunt, now that was a game. You know why? One button.You think I'm kidding. My dad and I used to have Duck Hunt tournaments. He was actually really good. Until he had his stroke.Well the funny thing is that the stroke actually made him a better player, he just lost interest.Well whose fault is that? Doctor?You ever had this stuff.Well it smells like my grandmother.You haven't met my mother. It's a miracle I do anything but complain.The world would be a boring place if we didn't complain. Come on. There's got to be something. One thing, just one thing, that drives you nuts.It's infuriating right?To complaining.Is it all gone?Finally. Where have you been?Oh, this is Dr. McRae, my therapist.She drove me home. Ring a bell?Where have you been?You were supposed to pick me up. 8 hours ago.You're right. Let me go back and talk to the doctor - see if maybe they can diagnose me with something that better suits your needs.And my house isn't a summer camp. You can't just come and go as you please and not take some responsibility.This. Us.You know what I thought the other day? That I might actually die without ever having sex again.I know.You're my Yam.I can't.I don't know what's wrong. It won't work.Where's Alan?Excuse me.Where am I?This is Heaven?There are lines in Heaven?I think it's a fair question.Well am I going to go to Heaven?What if I want to just die? That's it. No Heaven.How can being stuck in some nonexistent void with my grandparents be fun. I spent my entire life trying to get away from my family, now I'm going to have to spend an eternity with them.But that's not what I want.I'm going to die aren't I?It's true.I'm not getting any better.Did you know that they found a Quasar 7 billion light years away? 7 billion light years! It's more than 3 billion years older than our planet, and we're just seeing it now; and you think I'm going to live?Cancer is an epidemic! It killed Alan, it's going to kill me, and it's going to kill millions more after me. There's nothing anybody can do.Will you stop! I can't do this anymore. It doesn't matter. None of it. I'm going to die and with nothing to show for my life. 100 years from now my legacy be will be that of just another person dead of cancer. That's it.I know you're only trying to help, but this isn't working for me anymore. I'm sorry.I need a new lint brush.And I have a doctor's appointment next Thursday...The big one.Are you listening to me?So you'll take me?Really?I want to come back to work.What's so crazy about that?Yeah.You said I look great.Thank you Phil.Oh it's really good. We've come to an understanding. It takes whatever it wants and depletes me of my every will to live, and I let it.Gladly. This here is a depiction of what Pompeii's final 19 hours probably looked like.According to Pliny the Younger - \"You could hear women lamenting, children crying, men shouting. There were some so afraid of death that they prayed for death. Many raised their hands to the gods, and even more believed that there were no gods any longer, and that this was one unending night for the world.\"I'll be in Pompeii if anyone needs me.Could be worse. Right?Don't worry...I get it. You're a good guy.Hey, it's Adam. Where are you? Maybe you forgot, but my appointment is today. So call me back.Fuck!Hey man, I need you to do me -Hi mom.Don't worry about it. I'm fine.No, really, I'm okay. But thank you.We're fine.I'm fine.You're like some kind of deranged pusher.What?What?You're unbelievable.Well who needs a doctor when they've got you and your fanny pack?Well stop! You're driving me crazy. With the comments and the pills every five minutes. Just stop. I'm not dad. I can take care of myself.I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.Mom.Mom!No. It's not.So what do we do?But you said surgery was too risky.Does that mean...I can get handicap parking?Smells good.Who's that?That's what she just texted?She wants to know what time you're going over to her house?Alright, well I'm gonna go lie down.What the fuck?Who's James?He wants to know if you're still coming over tonight. Should I tell him you're having a girls night? Oh wait, you already told him to bring the wine. That's funny. It seems as though you've double booked yourself.Oh, you just got another text from him. He says \"Your skin is the canvas upon which my dreams are painted...\"Hope you're not too sore from this afternoon.\" He seems sweet.Well now how do you know what I'm thinking?You've been cheating on me.Am I?What's this?And this? And this? And this? There are over a dozen naked photos of you in here.Have you lost your mind? I had the most important appointment of my life today and you missed it because you were off with your \"art partner\"...And what the fuck do you know about Africa?Did you cheat on me?DID-YOU-CHEAT-ON-ME!?No. I'm going to pretend you never existed.You know, you have a pretty fucked up way of showing your commitment.I want you out my house.I know.You remember the last time we came out here?That memory is so far from me,No, prom night. It feels like a lifetime ago... I know it happened, but that's it. It's like someone else's memory.I can't believe this is all actually happening.Both.You know, I used to think that I was actually going to spend the rest of my life with Rachel...granted that might not be so far off. What a waste.Don't you ever give up?Seriously, who's going to have sex with me?I look like Powder. Plus I have erectile dysfunction...temporary. I hope.I think I should drive.You're drunk.How hard can it be?This might be my last chance.What? I didn't see it.I know what I'm doing.No. I'm driving and I want to go this way.For once can you just shut up and let me do this? So I'm driving the wrong way? Big fucking deal.Get out.GET! OUT!Well you're a selfish piece of shit who cares more about getting his dick wet than actually being a friend.I don't want to die.I'm 25 years old and I've never even been to Canada. I haven't lived my life! I'm really, really scared.I'm sorry for the way I acted. I should have never stormed out like that.You mean like a complete asshole?If I don't die, I think we should go on a date.Why not?It makes for a nice incentive.Yes you can.Yes, you can.A wise person once told me - you can't change the wind, but you can adjust the sails.That's what you think.Good night.What are you doing?It's a little creepy.You think this is a good suit to wear to your own funeral?What is all this?Oh, great.Glad to hear there's nothing unusual about removing organs.Mom, this is Nuprin.What the hell.That's great dad.I am feeling.I love you too dad.Egh em. Mom. Mom.They're great, thank you.I'm a little freaked out.Will you be here when I wake up?About how long?Well what if it doesn't work. How do you know I won't wake in the middle of the surgery? What if I-That is the most beautiful dresses. Where did you get it?I'm here.I feel wonderful.Magic!Mommy! Daddy!Remember the time you walked in on me masturbating?...That was so awkward...What hotel is this? We need to go on more vacations.You're here too! You're soooooo awesome... Katie McRae, Katie McRae, Katie McRae. Mic-Rae, Dr. Awesome Mic- Rae...I'd love to make you pancakes sometime.PAIN! PAIN! PAIN! PAIN! PAIN! PAIN! PAIN! PAIN!You must be Margaret.That's me.I'm so glad you could make it. I'm really sorry about Mitch.Please come inside. You're just in time.Sorry about the mess. I just moved in...The ocean air is supposed to be good for my recovery.We're having a Duck Hunt tournament. You play?It's really easy. One button does everything.You mind?Please.

Oh my god.What kind?You don't know?Well how bad is it?You have cancer.Not now.Adam I'm 24 years old! You're 25.What are we going to do? I don't know what to do.Do they know?If I had known you were coming I would have made something else.No it's called sei-tan.No, but it has a texture just like meat.A date?She thinks we're getting married.Oh jesus Adam, just tell her.Edith, I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you. But I promise, there's nothing for you to worry about. I'm going to be here every step of the way, to help take good care of your son.Keep your eyes closed. No peeking.Even better.Keep your eyes closed.You're not adopted.Okay. Open your eyes.Surprise!It's Noodle.Adam, IT's a he, and HE's adorable...Having a dog is supposed to help with the healing process.I thought you'd be happy...I didn't realize it would be such a big deal. I can bring him back to the shelter in the morning.No, you're right, it's not a good idea. Tomorrow I'll take him back where he'll be kept in a tiny cage with 10 other dogs who will bully him, and rape him, and then he'll eventually be euthanized.Really?This is going to be so good for you.Adam, those people just threw you a party...They love you.Nothing.I love you.Everything's going to be okay.I'm totally yours,Noodle.The dog.I think he needs to go out.I can't do this with him barking.Hold me.Do you want me to?Okay.In the morning.Adam do you know where the dog leash is?He likes running around with the other dogs.Are you smoking weed?Since when do you smoke?You got a prescription for medicinal marijuana?What's wrong with you?Where did that TV come from?I thought we already agreed that my painting was going there.You want me to put my painting next to a television?Art needs to breathe Adam!...Do whatever you want. I'm taking your dog to the park!...And open a window. This isn't a dorm room.Hey, it's Rachel. I must be doing something really important. I'll give you a call when I'm done...yay!Hey, it's Rachel. I must be doing something really important. I'll give you a call when I'm done...yay!Adam?Adam?I hope I'm not interrupting.This is your therapist?OK. Katie. What are you doing here?Ugh. Shit. Thank you so much for doing that. Life's been a little crazy lately, which I'm sure Adam has told you all about. I love those shoes.I was at the gallery.I know. I'm sorry. I totally spaced. With the opening only three months away my head's just all over the place.Don't look at me like that. You know this is a hard time for me.I'm not just some car service here to shuttle you around!And what is it that I'm not taking responsibility for?I can't handle this! You make it sound like I'm your wife.I'm sorry if your cancer isn't turning me on.You think this is easy for me seeing you sick like this? The past few months have been hard on me too. It's not always about you.Why are you so good?What's wrong?Why?Okay, I'll pick one up.Am I getting fat?What?Yes.Of course.Hey, it's Rachel. I must be doing something really important.

Beautiful day isn't it?Yo....What's that smell? Are you wearing perfume?Well, you smell like the cast of Steel Magnolias.For a second there I thought maybe you'd fucked Olympia Dukakis.Sorry music's too loud, it's making it hard for me to hear your whining.I don't get it, that guy is clearly a total douchebag...He's wearing Capris!You haven't had sex in three weeks?What the fuck are you talking about? I don't think she's waiting for you to ask anything. You're using her shampoo. Next thing you'll be using her tampons.But seriously, let me get this straight - she has her own place, yet she spends every night with you, in your bed, but she won't sleep with you?So when does it become a big deal? Five weeks? Six weeks? A year? My cut off...4 days. That's when I begin to worry.Look around, there are like a million Rachel's in this city alone...well, she's kind of hot, so maybe half a million.My parents are in a lull, which is what happens after 35 years of marriage. You've only been dating her four months. At our age sex is all we have. Every time she refuses to sleep with you a small piece of every man's soul dies. She's killing us Adam...You're a semi- smart, semi-successful, semi- average looking dude. Just based on that you could get with at least one third of the female population.Would you sleep with my friend.No just in general.See this is what I'm saying.I love you.Ah, mothballs?Looks like my group is here.See you guys later.Coming up here on our left is the \"Origins of Man\" exhibit on loan from the Smithsonian Institute. It won't be open to the public for a few more months, so you're one of the first groups to see it. Adam!Everyone this is Adam, he's the curator of ancient civilizations here at the museum.Why don't you tell us what we're looking at.Who wants to hear about the caveman?Caveman. RRRRRR!Come on! Tell us what happened to the caveman.That's quite a story. Thank you Adam.You really know how to win a crowd.I see dinosaurs.Look at how tight that shirt is. She's totally aware of how large her breasts look too. This morning when she got dressed, she said to herself - \"I have these things and I want the world to see them.\"Why are you in such a rush?Relax. We have plenty of time.What the fuck is wrong with you?Yeah right.Get the fuck out of here. You have cancer?When did this happen?Who?Who found the tumor?When were you going to tell me?If I had cancer I'd tell you right away.Holy shit!Okay, let's relax here. I think the best thing to do is to look on the bright side.This is your chance to do all the things you've always wanted. This is it. This is your time to live it up. Plus, do you know how much pussy we're going to get?I know, it's crazy.Well I'm his best friend, so talking to me in a way is kind of like talking to him.Wait. It's not too late.\"Franz Schlegel is an American `medical intuitive' and `mystic psychiatrist'. Schlegel's teachings are widely recognized as a global spiritual awakening that is transcending individual and collective human consciousness\"... You're actually going to read this shit? This guy is a fucking tool.Let's go to Mardi Gras!Because it's Mardi Gras man. It's like a giant orgy of the sexiest women you can imagine all throwing themselves at you, screaming to be fucked. It's a fuck fest.We need to go see the world.Adam you can not let your cancer go to waste.Well if you're not going to take advantage of your cancer, then I will.Excuse me.I'm looking to buy a few books -No that's okay. They're for my best friend, Adam.He's pretty sick.Yeah. Cancer, not cool.I know it's been really hard.Honestly? Sometimes I just wish it was me instead of him...to relieve some of the burden, you know? I just...I just want to help.I'll tell you what happened. Cancer happened, and you need to get on the train.No, I did.Night blindness. Rods and cones are off.Great. Maybe she'll move there.Are you joking? Do you see the way she treats you?You have cancer for fuck's sake! If I was your girlfriend, I'd be baking you cookies and blowing you every thirty minutes. Instead, she's yelling at you over some fucking painting. Her art sucks. You don't want to put that on your wall. It looks like someone threw up a shrimp cocktail and then used it to spackle the Berlin Wall.Bullshit. She's fucking you in the ass Adam. This is the one time in your life you can do whatever you want. If you want to smoke weed, then smoke. You want a 50 inch flat screen TV, then get the fucking TV! And if you want to go to Mardi Gras, then LET'S GO TO MARDI GRAS!You're totally missing my point.What are they laughing at?My best friend is a giant pussy.When I was 12.And if you look over on your left you'll see our newest exhibit \"The Last Days Pompeii.\" Buried in 79 AD by the catastrophic eruption of Mt. Vesuvius, Pompeii remained hidden and forgotten until 1748 when archeologists began to excavate the site. Here we see exquisitely preserved objects that offer a glimpse into the day-to-day life of this ancient city.This here is Adam, one of our curators. Adam do you want to tell us what you're working on?Ok. Moving along we see the beautiful watercolor paintings of John James Audobon.Yoooooo.Not around. Leave a message.Hey guys.Bad time?Whoa! Nice! Now that I would put on the wall. I can see you're in the middle of something. I'll just be in the other room.Shame on you.Your skin is the canvas upon which my dreams are painted?Is \"dreams\" a metaphor, for-Prom night. How could I forget? Jen Zabrowski went down on me right where you're sitting.Jen giving me a blow job?You okay?The girl or the cancer?It's some pretty fucked up shit.We need to get you laid.No.Some girls are into it?Then let's go get me laid.You don't have a license.Do you even know how to drive?Hard enough that you don't have a license.Driving! You care about driving! We could be on Everest getting high on Ayahuasca with Sherpas, and you want to drive!...Forget it, I give up. Drive.Hey Miss Daisy, will you please watch where your going?That's what the mirrors are for.Turn right.Apparently not. YOU'RE GOING THE WRONG WAY!Adam! Turn the car around.What the fuck is wrong with you?You're an idiot.This is my car.You're being a real douche.Adam, open the door.Don't you dare call her. Not after everything she's done to you.You're a pussy.Night.Watching you sleep.I know. I can't help it.What about a Viking funeral?You know, we put him on a boat... cover it with...dirt and...branches...whatever you can find. We push it out...into the sea...or the ocean...and then shoot flaming arrows, boom! It catches on fire...And that's it. It's awesome.I got it.Nope. You don't have cancer anymore.
