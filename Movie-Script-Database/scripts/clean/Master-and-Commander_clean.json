{"Master-and-Commander": {"JACK": {"raw_line": "Thankee KillickHow I do hate a lee shoreIntelligence reports had her leaving Boston on the 12th, that should put us at least a week ahead.In for a \"Surprise\". Now that's wit. \"In for a Surprise\". 'Pon my word I shall have to tell the Doctor.Don't put her on the reef, Tom.What do you have there, Stephen?I do and I am not in the least surprised, for it reminds me of nothing so much as a ship under sail. See here the bowsprit. Here the mast, and here the backstays running aft.I was thinking when our business here is finished, we will have to put in to Recife for provisions. You may care to take a tour round the forests of Brazil, botanizing and collecting specimens. An anaconda or two. A giant cassowary.Killick! Killick there! Strong coffee, and light along my topcoat.Where away?Mr. Hollom?Lie down! Everybody lie down!Run out the guns! Marines to the tops, and get that wounded man below!Note the time Mr. Watt.Closer, Mr. ALLEN. You must lay me alongside her at pistol-shot.Mr. Pullings - bow-chasers to fire as she bears....wait WAIT! And FIRE!Belay there ye poxed son of a whore!Damned if there ain't. We'll tow her.Stern-chasers to fire when she's in range!Start the water, carronades over the side.Pull! Pull for your lives.Quiet now. No calls, no shouts. Mr. ALLEN, signal the men in the boats to head due east.Keep rowingPass the word to ship oarsVery good, Mr. Lamb.What's the butchers bill?Later.Who's this - Joe Plaice?Mr. Blakeney?Its a scratch.How did he find us Stephen? Seven weeks sailing and he happened in darkness on our exact position. Its uncanny. He really is a phantomTosh. How could that be?We're not going home.What is our purpose here gentlemen? Why were we sent? To punish a blackguard privateer who has decimated our Atlantic whaling fleet and now threatens to do the same in the pacific. Are we to leave those ships to his mercy and slink back into Portsmouth - another defeat to add to the list. Is that what we draw our wages for? I say we pursue her and pay her back with interestThen there's not a moment to lose.Have her placed along the gunwale for now, Mr. Hollar, and the guns moved to that side also.Damn this wind, Mr. Pullings! The Acheron will be making a hundred and fifty miles a day in this.Let us be off, Mr. Allen!Speed, Mr. BoyleI am trying to remember that air they played all those years ago at the Governors house in Port Mahon. You remember When we first met. Corelli if I'm not mistaken.Or Locatelli. pom pom pom pomAye and you practising apon that poor bishop with your \"puddings athwart the starboard Gumbrils\" or some such arrant nonsense.No. No. Entirely off the mark. pom-pom- POM I have nowAnd pitch 'em up! It's spars and rigging we want!Not good enough! We must fire three broadsides to her two. Again!Mr. Blakeney? Think you can supervise a gun?'Spitfire', hop to it.Out Tompions... Run out your guns... Prime.As she bears, from forward aft. Point your guns... Fire!!Killick? Killick there. KILLICK appears.What do you have for us tonight?Aah! My favorite.Let's hear it, Mr. Mowett.Aye and when we do take her we shall give her to Tom Pullings as his first command. If he don't die before then. Bumpers up TomLord Nelson? Yes. I had the honour of serving under him at the Nile. Mr. Mowett, the bottle stands by you, sir. In fact I dined with him twice, and he spoke to me on both occasions.The first time he said to me - 'May I trouble you for the salt, sir?' I have always tried to say it as close as I could [ ] The second time someone had offered him a boat-cloak on a cold night and he said no, he was quite warm - his zeal for his king and country kept him warm.It sounds absurd, I know, and were it another man you would cry out, \"Oh, what pitiful stuff\" and dismiss it as mere enthusiasm, but with him you felt your heart glow.You see those two weevils, Doctor?Which would you choose?But suppose you had to choose?There I have you. You are completely dished. Don't you know in the Navy you must always choose 'the lesser of two weevils'?Show them in. The door opens to reveal NAGEL and WARLEY carrying something.What's this?[ ] In Boston?Just like the U.S. Constitution - our 12 pounders couldn't penetrate except at close range.Killick. Killick, there.An extra ration of rum for these men, from my private store.Rouse it up, Killick, and a bottle for Mr. ALLEN and me. Let us live whilst we're alive!He's vulnerable here.Cross her stern, rake her with a broadside through her length. But how to get close enough? Past those long eighteens. That's the devil of it.Capital. Thank him and let us be off.What did he say there?Where away?Set studdingsails and top gallants. Then wet the sails and have the idlers placed along the rail.Touch wood, Mr. Blakeney. And I fancy she plans to out-run us. Ask Dr. Maturin to join us, he loves a good chase.Speed, Mr. Calamy?I'll not lose her now. Set a course westwards.Mr Hollar, rig preventer backstays. Warps and light hawsers to the mastheads.Better get below, Mr. Pullings!Better get some food in you. Before it turns nasty.Strike the topgallants.Cape Horn, Doctor!Swim for the wreckage, man!Reduce sail!Axes!Set to then. Set to!!On the contrary. I insist on it.What is the problem?It's not pride nor anything like it, it's a question of duty.You can be as 'satiric' as you like, Stephen, but I have my orders. She is attacking our whalers. For why? Without whales we have no boot polish, nor any soap, nor oil for our lamps, not to oil our sabres and muskets. Destroying our whalers could win the war for Napoleon. Which is why we must catch this Acheron. As a man of learning surely you can see that.Any whatever cost I choose to pay. And I will calculate that myself, Stephen without reference to your friends in the ward room.We'll have to go further south, get around this bloody west wind.As far as is necessary, Mr. Pullings. The sixtieth parallel if need be.Praise be. At last.We have made our turn northward, Doctor. We are headed back toward the sun... The officers give a slightly ragged cheer....in anticipation of which. I asked Killick to prepare something special. Killick. Killick there.Gentlemen, I give you... our destination.That's where the whalers are, ain't it Mr Allen. So that's where the Acheron will be headed.Mr. Pullings, if you'll permit me, a slice of Albermale. For you Doctor, Redondo Rock.And, with a fair wind behind us the Acheron for me. 167. OPEN OCEAN, DOLDRUMS - DAYBest bowers chipped... Lot of rust on these forechains... black strake needs another coat.Stephen. Will we never make a sailor of you? The doldrums is a condition, not a region. But you tend to strike 'em here... ...between the trades, and the sou'easterlies. I hope the Acheron is having it as bad as we are.Come. I'd have thought you'd be delighted to go there. It is said to be a natural paradiseWell, we'll take on food and water once we're there, and as compensation for not having put ashore in Brazil I pledge that during that time, several days at least, you can wander at will, catching bugs and beetles to your heart's delight. You will be the first naturalist to set foot on the islands. That is my solemn promiseMutiny? No. They are already counting their share of the prize money.Ach, Stephen. Stephen. Pray stop your bellyacheing. We shall have rain presently, and if not we shall damned well tow ourselves out of this.Master at arms! Take that man below and clap him in irons. Mr. Pullings, defaulters at six bells.The man pushed past you without making his obedience. And yet you said nothing.'The right words'? He failed to salute you. It's deliberate insubordination.They what? Speak up, man!You can't make 'friends' with the foremast jacks, they'll despise you in the end. Nor do you need be a tyrant. It's leadership they want, strength, respect.You're what twenty-three, twenty-four?You've failed to pass for lieutenant twice. You can't spend the rest of your life as a midshipman.Well, it's an unfortunate business, Hollom. Damned unfortunate.'Article Thirty-Six. All other crimes not capital, committed by any person or persons in the fleet... shall be punished according to the laws, and customs, of the sea.' Mr. Nagel, you're an old man-of-war's man and yet you failed to salute an officer. You knew what you were doing. Have you anything to say in your defence?Have his officers anything to say for him?Seize him up.One dozen. Bosun's mate, do your duty.Red hell......and bloody death!I am not a \"flogging captain\". I have not once rigged the grating on this voyage, not once in twelve thousand miles. Besides, I wager you will find a deal more brutality on land.Well you are party to it on my ship. Men must be governed. Often not wisely I grant you, but there are hierarchies even in nature, as you've often said yourself.Yes. Fine words I'm sureVery fine words Stephen, but In these current circumstances, hard-work and firm discipline is what keeps our little wooden world together.Of course. What of it? Of course they have their grog!The men will have their grog Stephen. It is part of the immemorial tradition of the serviceStephen...Well I will not hear them! From you or anyone. You understand! Things are as they are for good or bad whether or not they have a place in your damned papist philosophy. If you are here to make music then sit down and play. If not be gone, for you have come to the wrong shop for anarchy!What is that abominable noise, for God's sake?The enemy cannot come on us without a wind, Mr. Mowett.What do you make of it, Doctor?[ ] Creature?Bosun. Fire off some flares.Sergeant, what the devil are you thinking of? Turn the glass and strike the bell.Padeen. What are you doing on the quarterdeck?Below! All of you men below! Tell the bosun those off-duty may sleep with their lamps on.You don't think...?Well?Then he probably has been. Sailors will abide a great deal, but never a Jonah. It's like a white crow - the others peck it to death.I desired to save you the trouble of looking for a cure. No doubt it will all be sorted by the morning.The fact is, [ ] not all of us become the men we once hoped we might be. But we are all God's creatures. If some of us thought ill of Mr. Hollom, or spoke ill of him, or failed him in respect of fellowship, then we ask your forgiveness, Lord, and we ask for his.Amen.All hands about ship!Go on.And her course?Subject to the requirements of the service, Stephen. I could not in all conscience delay for the sake of an iguano or a... giant peccary - interesting no doubt, but of no immediate application....you forget yourself, sir.The promise was conditional....and we have no time for your damned hobbies, sir!Yes, Killick. Just the one.Continue due west, Mr. Bonden.Calamy! Get Higgins! Padeen, Davies, carry the Doctor below.Are you equal to the task?You men get about your business.No. It was because of Higgins. Can't have him poking around in your belly without a solid platform to work on.All set, Higgins?Oh, a week perhaps. There is no great hurry.It may not have been the Acheron that we sighted. Nor can we be sure of her destination. No, I think we shall go home now, before peace breaks out with France, God forbid.\"Empty-handed\"? Not a bit of it. What about these plants and animals which Blakeney has been collecting? The British museum will need an entire new wing for 'em.Tosh. Name a shrub after me. Something prickly and hard to eradicate.I forgot to ask you - did you see your bird?Indeed it was, I'm sorry...A phasmid?Mr. Hollar, rouse up all the yellow paint we have. I want six men with brushes slung over the side. Doudle!Get your sail makers working on this. Sixty yards by five yards with an eyelet every seven feet.Have Nagel patch it up and light a fire in it. Mr. Calamy!Once we're underway, replace some of the sails with the oldest, most patched set we have.Good. Spread it around the foredeck. The more mess the better.You've got good eyes, Hogg.Mr. Bonden, set a course west-south-west. We'll drop below the horizon and come up on the other side of him, let him think he's seen us first.A phasmid, doctor. It was you what gave me the idea.No? Well this one is.No, make a show of fleeing upwind, but panicky and disorganized, like a whaler might do.No offence, Mr. Hogg.Run up Portuguese colours. Load, Mr. Pullings. Triple shot 'em.No saluting, Mr. Blakeney, we're whalers here.I know what you want to say and my answer is no. I promised your mother I would return you in one piece and I have already failed her on that score. You will command a gun and then retire to defend the quarterdeck here with Dr. Maturin.Good shooting. Remind me to press her bow gunner, Mr. Pullings.Start the water and throw some barrels overboard.We're a long way from home. A long way from anywhere, But if Britain rules the waves she rules these waves too. And the blow we shall deal for his Majesty here will be felt just as keenly aye - and cheered just as loudly - as any dealt at Trafalgar or Cape St. Vincent.I don't say it will be easy. She's twice the men we have and they'll sell their lives dearly. But every man here is worth three of Boney's privateers, and I know there's not a faint heart among you. CALAMY pipes up -Mr. Mowett? [ ] A poem might be in order.What!We have her Mr. Mowett. Strike the Portuguese colours and run up the Jack... Mr. Pullings. Canvas off the gun-ports, and run 'em out. Mr. Howard? Marines away aloft.Helm's a lee!Run us down her larboard side then cut across her wake! Hold fire Mr Pullings! Hold till we're broadside on!Fire as she bears!

Sit down.Unless she was alerted to our presence, and looking for us.The French have their spies, in Britain as elsewhere.I am saying do not imagine it was a lone privateer who did this to us.

Your courage, your fortitude in battle, your skill at logarithms and double elevations whatever they may be. And when you are rated lieutenant you shall have someone to tie your bootlaces for you. Aye and help you with your jacket. Here take my handkerchief. I believe we are summonsed to dinner.The deaths in actual battle are the easiest. For my own part - those who die under the knife or from some consequent infection: I have to remind myself that it is the enemy who killed them, and not me. Warley was a casualty of war, as surely as if a French ball had taken him.At the same time....You know that I wear two hats on every voyage. I am the captains particular friend and supporter, but also I am the ships doctor in which later capacity I am party to....There is talk below decks of turning back. Or rather that we should have turned back some weeks ago. Of course the men would follow \"Lucky Jack\" anywhere, and usually in the confident expectation of victory. But that of course is the problem.That you are not accustomed to defeat Jack. That you have taken it too personally. That chasing this larger, faster ship, with its long guns, is beginning to smack of pride 'which goeth before destruction'?'Duty', ah yes.

Mr. Howard, a petrel is not good eating!I was merely remarking that you have always prided yourself on not being a flogging captain and this...I'm not a party to it on land.Hierarchies. That is the excuse of every tyrant in history. Of Nero. Of Boneparte....We are not animals and I for one am opposed to authority, that egg of misery and oppression..And grog I suppose.Well a shameful tradition it is too. To have them pressed from their homes, kept in a permanent state of dull inebriation....confined for months in a wooden prison, Never more than a few hours sleep and flogged when drunken idleness drives them to....I am stating plain factsMr. Howard, let me beg you, if the men can't eat it or I can't dissect it, please do not shoot every creature you see.I'm sure I've never heard the like.Perhaps it's the mother of the creature Mr. Howard shot.[ ] A manatee. A sea-elephant possibly. Though I have never known one with a cry like this.Mr Hollom. Sir. Try to contain yourself. Hold his head. Mr Hollom. Padeen 201. STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT.There's nothing physically wrong with him. He thinks he's been cursed by the 0men.A 'Jonah'? My God, you believe it too.How extraordinary.Those birds!A species of cormorant. But apparently flightless, by all that's Holy. I believe that is unknown to science.They are a type of iguana I should think, and therefore vegetarian. His telescope remains focussed on the cormorants. BLAKENEY is wholly absorbed in the iguanas.Yes. Most certainly. And if we can, some eggs.Oh!I should think a pair of them. Then you can present one of their offspring to the king.No. Iguanas are land animals.By Jove Bonden you are right! Two new species in as many minutes.What is all that confounded bellowing?Have you forgotten your promise?Well perhaps there's an opportunity to serve both our objectives. As I understand it you mean to go round the end of this long island, then start your voyage. I could walk across it, be on the other side long before...I would walk briskly, pausing only for important measurements and almost certainly making valuable discoveries...I see. So after all this time in your service I must simply be content to form part of this belligerent expedition, hurry past inestimable wonders, bent solely on destruction...No Jack, You have forgotten your self. You once believed in the rights of each individual man no matter how useless or lowly. But it seems to me now that the long exercise of power has brought you to the point where even a solemn promise......a promise to a friend of ten years standing who has stood by you and supported you.......across half the worlds oceans often at risk to his own lifeI'm sure of it.That is more than likely, sure.Thank you, Mr. Blakeney.I have not - no bird these many days. What kind of a bird?It's all right, I am quite capable of walking.You will just make it worse... by prodding, Mr. Higgins, it cannot be got at... except by opening me up.Tell me this wasn't on my account?Not Higgins. I do this with my own hand.[ ] You are sure you have a head and a stomach for this kind of thing?Then hold my belly, pressing firmly when I give the word.You will have to raise the rib, Higgins. Take a good grip with the square retractor. Up. Harder, harder. Snip the cartilage.Now, Jack, a steady downward pressure. Good. Keep it so. Give me the davier. Swab, Higgins. Press, Jack, press.There she is.Is that all of it?Easy away, Jack. Handsomely with the retractor. Higgins, look to the Captain, while I swab.My goodness, what is this?'Pon my word you have the makings of a true naturalist.Shall we take a tour of your aviary?Yes. Padeen!How long does the Captain intend that we stay here, do you know?But surely, we must make haste for the Marquesas?But how will it sit with the Admiralty? To have spent six months in a fruitless pursuit and then come home empty-handed?I fear, Jack, you have burdened me with a debt I can never repay.A shrub? I shall name a giant tortoise: Testudo Aubreii!No, Mr. Blakeney. I would think it an experiment of absolutely vital importance. But afterwards, I do desire to find that flightless cormorant, assuming that is what it is, and that I still have strength enough to catch it.A moment! You're a worse tyrant than any ship's captain.I did not. My greatest discovery was your phantom.Not a bit of it. William and I made a unique discovery.Tell him, Mr. Blakeney.I see. A wolf in sheep in sheep's clothingI'm not sure a phasmid can be a predator.[ ] Thank you, Killick.Shall we begin?Jack, brother, you're gathering wool.Maybe you did.While I was tending the prisoners they told me their doctor died of fever, two weeks ago. There was no doctor on that ship when we boarded it. And I doubt you will find one there now.Shall we?
