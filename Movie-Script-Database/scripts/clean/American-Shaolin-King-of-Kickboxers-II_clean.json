Kwan continues the attack, and Drew evades, their movements matching the movements on the TV almost move for move. It is a beautiful ballet, and Drew ends it by sweeping Kwan down to the ground.

He walks off to the side of the area to dump it. As he dumps the dirt, a pole appears and CRACKS across his back. He drops the buckets and falls to the ground.

He pauses for a moment with the door open, then shuts it sadly. He looks out over the courtyard, which is completely deserted. Drew sighs, hitches his backpack onto his back and starts out.

Drew smiles, stashes the map and starts across the rope bridge, hand over hand. He looks down once, at the DROP, then forces himself to look straight ahead. He just starts across when the rope bends and jumps. Drew turns around to see a man RIGHT BEHIND HIM.Manipulating the spear like a master.

I saw it in this movie... Kwan shakes his head and walks over to Drew, standing in front of him. KWANI'll still win. Besides, the Shaolin monks never had tapes to study... they did it this way... right?Look, Bob, I'm not bothering you, am I? BOBI'm not your son, Bob. Lay off. It is a threat, one that Bob almost takes up. Kwan feels the tension in the room, and starts to say something. BOBWhen I'm the best fighter in the country, I'm not going to let you be part of my entourage...No next time, Master. Maybe... ... you should find a new student. I just can't do it \u00ad I'm not getting any better!You mean... all the stories...?Why are you telling me this? KWANNever were?I'm going to the Shaolin Temple \u00ad they can train me so I will never lose like that again. Kwan feels Drew's forehead. A long beat here as Kwan studies Drew's eyes.Master...Where is the Shaolin Temple? Shaolin?The Shaolin Temple? How hard can that be? Geez, doesn't anyone speak English here?I am going to join the temple as a monk. Ashema translates this for her friends, and they titter anew. They gesture to Drew's longish hair and laugh, and then make some attempts at martial arts movements.Whoa! Ashema climbs off the back and takes the bike from Drew, marveling at his awe-struck face.What's the deal here? Is everybody deaf in this temple? Even if you heard me, you wouldn't understand, would you? Huh, baldy? Shine your head for a quarter? He walks off frustrated, wondering what he has to do to get noticed. He walks back into the chanting chamber. INT. TEMPLE \u00ad SAME DAY The monks are still chanting. Drew stands there, listening some more, moving with the beat, until they stop chanting. Drew, thinking it was some kind of performance, claps his hands.What do you mean, sir?I didn't come all this way, from America, to get turned away. I want in. I want to become a Shaolin monk.Not in this case.Hey! What about my...I have to do this. I can't go home, not until I'm a monk. I'd be even more of a disgrace... The old man talks to Ashema for the first time. He chatters in Chinese, motioning towards Drew.Bau Bau? ASHEMAHow long?Did they let him in?Please tell your grandfather, your Bau Bau, he is a wise man. And that he tells a good story. The grandfather smiles at him, nodding his head.You... You speak English? I'm sorry, I was just goofing... I apologize, master. I didn't mean to make fun of you... San De shrugs it off. Apology accepted.It was at first. I was uncomfortable, in pain, actually, but as time went on, I got... into it, I guess. The sacrifice made me feel... in control, you know what I mean?At first I was really bored, and very lonely. But then,It was an incredible experience \u00ad I said I'd do it, and I did it. San De, watching Drew intently, smiles at this last. He stands up and bows to Drew. Drew bows back, from his seated position.I do. The Drill Sergeant comes up behind Drew and WHACKS him in the side with his elbow.Yes, without pause. The Drill Sergeant nods his head. MONKYes, without pause.I mean, no, of course not. Then, another gong sounds, and the quizzing is concluded. A figure moves down a corridor in beautiful robes. Everyone bows down, their eyes on the floor, to the figure, who is moving towards the raised platform in the center. Drew, also bowed down, sneaks a peak at the figure. It is San De! San De catches his eye and smiles slightly. He winks at Drew, then clears his throat. Everyone stands up again.Oh, unbelievable, in the same place...You got a problem, man?What are you doing, man? MONKNo way, man! Get your own...What's with that guy?Mr. James designs my hair, master. I don't think... D.S.Can't I just wear a patch?What outside world? I don't want to be seen by anybody... He rubs his hand over his head, and then sees the others. Li is smiling.Jerk! Li comes over to the new bed, and in silence they get climb into their respective beds. D.S. switches off the lights, then leaves, and Drew stares up at the ceiling. DREWBlow me!Good night, Li.I didn't say I wasn't going to eat it... Geez! He turns to the rest of the disciples.Well, at least we start training today, right, guys?Wonder what they'll start us with first?We're using the shovels as weapons?\"Ain't no cure for the Shaolin Temple Blues... \"What'd you do that for?I'm gonna get you, man.

Gao smiles and shakes his head. Gao starts forward, and WHACKS Drew in the leg with a leg sweep. Drew tries to keep his balance, and fights a valient, but losing battle. He falls over the side, the dirt in his buckets flying everywhere. Gao wipes his hands off and continues walking. CLOSEUP ON DREW'S BLOODY HAND A huge splinter sticking out of it. He is in real pain. The D.S. walks over and looks at the splinter, and in one move pulls it out.So what is this 'night soil' stuff anyway? LIOh, man! You guys actually use this as fertilizer? That's disgusting!Hi, Gao. How you doing?There's something on the bottom of your basket.This is ridiculous.I've got an idea on how to get even with our beloved Drill Sergeant... They all huddle a little closer. EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE \u00ad DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF D.S. AS HE WALKS ALONG THE PATH. In the b.g. can be seen Drew, Li, Wu and a couple other of the disciples. They are waiting for something.We have to stand up for our rights! If they don't even know we're dissatisfied, things will never change. GAOAre we men or mice? Sheep or the shepherd?I'm for going to the Headmaster right now! They are all ready. They head for the door, but Gao doesn't move. Drew stops at the door and turns to Gao.Master San De! SAN DEWe have something to say...No, really, I want to... San De holds up his hand. He is the final authority.Gentlemen, this calls for a party! He runs to his backpack and pulls out a boom box with speakers, and puts on some good old American Rock 'N' Roll. Everyone, but Gao, is moving in time with the music. Drew is the most accomplished dancer, but the others are pretty bad. The entire effect of the bald-headed monks rocking out is very comic. Drew starts showing Li and Wu a couple of dance routines . Everyone is having a great time.What do you mean, 'Think not thinking'? MONKI can't do this!This isn't martial arts \u00ad it's gymnastics!Excuse me, Master, but there aren't any mats here.Let's do it.I'm not sure I got that last throw clear in my mind.If you're getting too old for this kind of training, I understand.I think I've got it now. Xie Xie! The group disburses, shaking their heads in wonder. Li comes up to Drew, who is still lying on the ground.He hurts more than me, he's just not bleeding, that's all.This sure beats sweeping...The crowd is going wild. Just then, out of the shadows comes an attacking staff, SLAMMING into Drew's unprotected stomach! Drew, ready to double over in pain, hears the staff hit the frisbee, and stands up straight, adjusting the frisbee that saved his stomach. Before he can react, the staff SMACKS him in the back of the head and sends him pitching to the floor.Master! Stop! No more will go in!Again, deformed. The D.S. nods and walks off, leaving Drew to stare questioningly at Li. EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE \u00ad DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TEMPLE COURTYARD, WHERE ALL THE DISCIPLES AREASHEMA!ASHEMA! Here! She looks at Drew again, and this time recognizes him. Drew arrives and impulsively he gives her a hug, genuinely very happy to see her. Li arrives and pulls them apart.What!?!Who's going to tell, Li? You?We'll be there. INT. DORM ROOM \u00ad NIGHT ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DORM ROOM, LI STANDING IN FRONT OF DREW, THE REST OF THE DISCIPLES GATHERED AROUND.You dance, and talk. And have a good time.Look, dancing's easy. I'll show you. We'll start with slow dancing. An OOOH escapes from the guys.Dirty dancing!This is going to be great...Disciple Gao was better than me. Drew pauses, and Gao is even more surprised at the revelation.I lost my temper. He was only defending himself.Now, we're ready!Great party...Play this when I signal, OK? She nods and walks off. Drew motions for Gao and the guys to come over. They do, and when they do, Drew turns to the giggle girlsLadies, allow me to introduce my best friends in all of China... He drags Gao over to one of the prettier girls.This is Gao. And this wild man is Li... Drew does the same for Li, Wu, Su, Sou and all the others, forcing them to stand with the girls for a moment. When everyone is paired off, he motions to Ashema.Not now, Li... The hand comes in again, punching Drew in the shoulder hard.What can I do for you? TOUGHDid you say you were going to keep us OUT of trouble? The group pauses for a BEAT, then they all laugh, relaxing. INT. DINNER ROOM \u00ad DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GAO CARRYING A PLATE OF CHINESE FOOD OVER TO A TABLE WHERE THE DISCIPLES EATING, THEIR EYES SCANNING THE ROOM FORMaster, I can't tell you how sorry I am. I appreciate you both going to bat like that for me. I won't let it happen again.It doesn't have to be fair... DISSOLVE TO: ANGLE ON DREW LYING IN THE DARK Everyone else is asleep, but not Drew. He is staring at the ceiling.I'm with you! A cheer goes up from the entire group as Drew, Li and Gao embrace. In the b.g. can be seen the D.S., who is observing all this. INT. SAN DE CHAMBER \u00ad DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SAN DE'S CHAMBER, SAN DE WAITING FOR DREW IN ONE OF THE CHAIRS.What if I can't handle it? What if I fail?Yeah, I'm staying. If only to keep you guys out of trouble! They walk off, and just as they round a corner, a BANG is heard as one of the monks drops the heavy wooden lid of a storage barrell. Drew jumps, spinning around in the direction of the sound. LIWhat? Honest, it's happening! I...Special training? You mean...?No. It is my choice, and my responsibility. I'm sorry... He embraces her for the last time, and she openly begins to cry. He holds her for a moment, then breaks the embrace and with one last long look at Ashema, walks away. EXT. TRAINING AREA \u00ad DAY 103With pleasure. Drew tries another kip, pushing his feet towards the D.S.' chest. He lands on his feet easily, surprised. EXT. WATERFALL \u00ad DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW AND GAO UNDER THE WATERFALL. THEY ARE BOTH IN HORSE STANCES. THEY NOD AT EACH OTHER, AND THEY BEGIN GOING THROUGH A SLOW FORM, MOVING THEIR ARMS AND LEGS CAUTIOUSLY, BUT WITH POWER.Boy, his spirit is strong...Lucky shot, slant eye!I wonder what you did now... INT. SAN DE CHAMBER \u00ad DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW AND SAN DE SITTING ACROSS FROM EACH OTHER. San De has an ornately embroidered golden box in his hand, and he is showing it to Drew. SAN DEI will, Master.This humble, not fighting stuff is harder, and more painful, than it looks!I'm a monk. I've taken a vow to abstain... WOMANI'll know! Throw me my clothes, please. Pouting, the woman takes Drew's pants and tosses them to him, but they land about 5 feet away from the lake edge. DREWDespite the fact that this is every teenage boy's dream come true, I can't! He lowers her hands, and her head drops, pouting.Besides, if I were to break my vows, it would not be with you.Oh Mi Two Fwo He then turns and walks away.I'll say... EXT. WATERFALL \u00ad EARLY MORNINGIs this rope strong enough for both of us? No answer from the man, who is now pushing Drew to go faster. He is inching up closer to him, and occassionally kicking him to go quicker. DREWHold on... Drew hears the headmaster's voice.What the heck... Drew reaches down for the man's hand, letting the box fall. Their hands meet, and Drew pulls him up.Maybe he won't miss one little scroll... He shakes his head and starts for the front door.Master! I apologize, I did not see you. The Arhat says nothing, but just puts out his hand for the scroll. Drew bows again, and gets down on his knees.I failed, Master. A person was in danger... The Arhat holds up his hand, and Drew stops talking.What is the meaning of life?No. American.Thank you, Master. ARHATWe've got to rebuild this?Then I must pass this final test. Furthermore, I request that I be the first one through.I can't do it. FLASHBACK TO D.S.I am a Shaolin monk. He enters the chamber again, and the attacks start again. Drew, however, is prepared . He blocks, avoids, rolls, jumps and redirects the attacks on him, making his way across. He is about halfway across when an especially fierce and large statue comes crashing towards him. Drew, caught a little off guard, quickly adjusts and manages to jump and spin out of the way.Not this time. Drew quickly walks through the door. EXT. TEMPLE \u00ad SAME DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF CHEERING ASSEMBLAGE, SAN DE AND D.S. AT THE FRONT. HE HAS MADE IT!Anything.No problem. Without pause.Did you think he would get into the finals?I'll help any way I can.I came to the Shaolin Temple because of you, Trevor. You humiliated me, and I wanted to make sure it could never happen again.I've learned that... there's nothing to prove. Beating you is no longer important. It was my ego that had to be defeated, not you.No, master. I will not fight for personal glory, or for my ego.For the temple...

DREWAre they ready to begin their training?This is an interesting coincidence, as I was just on my way to your sleeping quarters to talk with you all. DREWI think I'd better...Here at the temple, we use a period of intense physical labor to test your patience, and to teach you humility and self-reliance. As you continue training, you will be given chores every day \u00ad remember the first time you saw me I was sweeping? Physical labor keeps us humble.Come with me...Legend states that Bodhidharma gave us tea. Once, while meditating, Bodhidharma fell asleep, a natural reaction we all have to fight against. San De looks pointedly at Drew, who doesn't meet his eyes.When he awoke, he was so enraged at his eyelids for betraying him, he tore them off and threw them to the ground. From those eyelids grew the first tea bush. You see, even the leaves look like eyelids. San De shows Drew a tea leaf.Exactly! You are like this cup, full of what you have learned. How can we show you Shaolin unless you first empty your cup? He picks up the cup and tosses the tea through an open window. He now pours into the empty cup.The rules and disciplines of the temple exist to free you, not restrict you. They keep your mind from harmfulI didn't think you were... The Shaolin martial tradition is built on challenges. We challenge ourselves, but we do not fight with each other. Never do we fight to see who is best \u00ad we train to be able to right wrongs, not to let our hands and feet express emotions run wild. A Shaolin never throws a punch or kick in anger. Shake hands and let your emotions go.Thank you all for coming. I am pleased that you brought this problem to our attention. May you sleep well tonightYou will not have to. The Headmistress starts to say something, but San De holds up his hand, stopping her. He leads them out, then closes the door and comes back to face Drew.You must accept the responsibility for your life. If we force you out of the temple, you can always blame theLive for the moment, Drew. The future will take care of itself. If you go through your days here, squeezing every last bit of life out of every minute, you need not fear failure.If you deliver this, you may ask this master, the most advanced monk of the Shaolin tradition, any question you wish, and he must answer it. San De takes out a map of the area.This map will lead you to the Jade Mountain. Let nothing deter from safeguarding the sacred scroll. You leave first thing tomorrow morning.The scroll that is in this box is more precious than life. Guard it well. He looks down at the man, who is about to lose it.Only one trial remains before you become full fledged fighting monks. The Wooden Man Chamber.Your request is granted.You are now Shaolin. We welcome you into our ranks as fighting monks... A roar rises from the assembled monks, and fireworks go off all around. ANGLE ON REAR OF COURTYARDThat monk was me.Before you leave for American, can you help at an international tournament in Beijing? The Shaolin temple has an entry, and he will be fighting men from all over the world \u00ad I'd like you to be there.Now, a friend would like to see you.Who could know? He fights the winner of the Western countries, which is why I wanted you here.You have learned much.There are some times when a Shaolin must fight, and some people who will not learn until they are taught a lesson.It's your call.

Take the backpack into the sleeping quarters.We are no longer Chinese or Americans, Han or Mongol. We are Shaolin. Everyone is a monk. GAOGo to sleep. No talking! We have an early day of training tomorrow. Gao collects his stuff and starts off to the new bed, hitting Drew with his shoulder. Drew trips him as he walks away, all done very secretively since the D.S. is watching.You don't like it, don't eat it. He takes the bowl away.Each one of you take a shovel.Weapons... ... in the war on infection. D.S. motions with his hand, and in the distance is the latrine building.Do a job well or don't do it.Sorry, all gone. Get some more. Drew stares at all the water spilled onto the ground, then looks up at the D.S., then forces a smile. He takes the proferred buckets of water . The D.S. indicates that they are to be held straight out to the sides, to work on the shoulder muscles. Drew turns and walks away, muttering to himself.He failed to pass through the wooden man chamber. He must leave the temple. The D.S. walks off.Back to work. Drew is about to say something, but doesn't. He returns to work.You are all responsible for anything that happens within your group. What happened yesterday falls on everyone's shoulders. So, all of you will do double work...Here at Shaolin, can't doesn't exist. Only won't. EXT. TRAINING AREA \u00ad DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES PAIRED OFF. Drew is working with his friend Li. They are moving through a series of techniques, ending with a flashy kicking technique which is to blocked by a special Shaolin technique.Do they always use mats in America?If you are scared, I'll get someone else. Perhaps Gao would assist me... ANGLE ON GAOAttack me straight on... Drew attacks, and is taken down brutally, smashed into the hard concrete floor. No attempt is made to cushion or soften the blow. Drew gets up right away, and attacks again. Again he is driven to the ground. This continues from all angles and all methods of attack.I said that's enough.Attack!Concentrate on your stance. All I want you to do is try to hold your stance. Li, you're first. Li smiles and walks into the waterfall, using a walkway that goes behind the thundering water. He moves into the water a little, and gets into a deep horse stance. He stand there, immovable. After a moment, he turns to look at D.S.In this exercise, you try to touch your partner's chest lightly, and your partner tries to block. The group gets started doing the drill, and Gao is almost caving Drew's chest in with his blows. He is so close to Drew that Drew doesn't have a chance to block it. On the last strike, Drew falls back to the ground. The D.S. is there immediately.Something wrong?And if it was always like this?Remember, let no one know you are disciples at the Shaolin Temple, but do not forget that you are. Dzai Jyan. They file out. EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE \u00ad SAME DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE DISCIPLES EXITING THE TEMPLE. As soon as they are out, the serious faces break into smiles, and they are teenagers again. Some of the disciples run off to join relatives waiting for them in the courtyard, while a group of them stick together. Drew is walking with Li, Wu and several others.Stop! Drew and Gao immediately break apart, breathing heavy and staring daggers at each other.Back to work. He turns and walks off, motioning for Drew and Gao to follow him. Drew follows immediately, with Gao behind him. Gao shoves him once. INT. SAN DE CHAMBER \u00ad SAME DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW, GAO AND SAN DE IN THE SHADOWS OF SAN DE'S ROOM.Drew! Come with me to San De's chamber... He turns to go, but the others are on their feet, ready to follow Drew.Just Drew. Drew looks at them and shrugs, then follows the D.S. INT. SAN DE CHAMBER \u00ad EVENINGMaster, may I? We accepted a challenge when this disciple came into our ranks. If we force him to leave China, we admit failure. Can we do that?Would you be so hard hearted as to turn him away from that which he so desperately needs? She is about to speak, but thinks better of it. San De stands up, signalling that the meeting is over.Using your muscles, bend my arm. Gao pulls down, while the D.S. tries to fight back with his muscles, but finally, after great strain, his arm bends. A cheer goes up from the group. D.S. smiles and motions for an old monk standing near him to take his place. the old man puts his arm up on Gao's shoulder, and takes a deep breath. He does not tense up his arm and shoulder.Try to hit me here with your feet.San De wants to see you, in his chambers.No.My last chance \u00ad when you come out the other side, we will be equals. Drew smiles at the D.S.'s attempt to lighten him up. He turns to look at the others from his disciple class, then opens the door and goes through. INT. WOODEN MAN CHAMBER \u00ad SAME DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF WOODEN MAN CHAMBER. Drew pauses for a moment, examining the room. It is filled with wooden statues of monks, all in different fighting positions. The carvings are precise and incredibly beautiful. Their arms, open hands, fists and legs are fashioned out of hard wood, and they look very dangerous indeed.There is no can't, only won't. FLASHBACK TO SEVERAL D.S.
