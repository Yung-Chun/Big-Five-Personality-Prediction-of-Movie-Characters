It's getting louder.Um...okay.No!Yeah..Yeah, Mom. I'm fine.On my way.Get the hell out of here! It's coming!Don't you see it?No!I dreamed you away before I was born! Mom said you couldn't come back!Leave her alone!You fucker!Mom...What's going on?What is this place?Oh...Lighten up, mister.My kind? What kind is that?Swell. I've just got a couple of questions for you...Do you love your parents?Are they alive?What's it like?I can think of a stronger word. Are you okay?Jacob.Yeah. I just haven't had much to eat lately.It's incredible. Best I've ever had.No. I've been on the road for a couple of days.Jacob Johnson.Springwood.Upstate about a hundred miles.My father died before I was born. My mother, she's dead, too.No.No.No.Yes, sir.Hi.They're dead.Is he alright?If you know that, then why do you smoke in front of him?Just what is YOUR problem, then?What happened?I can't sleep.No. I'm fine. Thanks.Yeah, no problem.You okay?No shit!What happened to her?Jesus.Thanks.I can't talk about it right now. I'll tell you later. I promise.I think I will.What! Jesus fucking...Oh, shit!Huh? What's going on?I'm not tired.That's right.Why? Who says? You know, people don't even really know why we sleep. They haven't found any physical reason for it.Sharks don't sleep. They can't pump water through their gills on their own. They have to always keep moving. If they stop, they can't breath. If they go to sleep, they die.I know. I'm just a kid. Don't worry about me, Wes. Go to sleep.Get everybody else. I have to tell them something.I MEAN it!He's neither. He haunts your dreams and if he kills you, you die for real.I know this sounds crazy, but I swear it's true. I went to bed one night and woke up in the middle of the road. Freddy Krueger killed my mother, blasted my whole town into his nightmare, and, worst of all, I think he wants to use me to kill more kids and bring more towns into his world.I'm not sure. I think I'm some kind of carrier. He's somehow inside me and as soon as I fall deep enough into sleep he'll be let loose. You guys were great to take me in. I just don't want to thank you by getting you all killed.That's what I've been trying to tell you.That's how YOU see it. I was part of the nightmare, so I'm the only one who notices the difference.You don't believe me, either, do you?Why are you still here?Feels good to see someone more fucked up than yourself, huh?But you haven't told me why you're here at this place.Yeah, that'd be great. Don't let me sleep, okay?Yeah. Thank God.I'm leaving.He can't hurt you if I'm gone. Maybe I'll go to the desert or something. I'll lie down in the middle of nowhere and finally get some sleep. Krueger can feed of the dreams of snakes and vultures.Don't do this to me. I'm just trying to protect you and the others.I don't understand why you're so mad at me.Get what?And you're going to convince me, huh?Yeah. Sure.NOOOOOOO!Nooooo!No! Don't let them take me!You don't understand! Let me go!Don't fucking put me under! You'll set him free!What do you want from me?Leave them alone!What have you done with my town?Over my dead body!Alright...just who the hell are you guys?The what?Hello? May I butt in here and ask some more stupid questions?By who?Why?Me? What can I do? Just who are you guys...really?I still don't understand what...What's going on?That's what you say...I could've told you that.You said I was fine. I have to get back. My friends are in trouble.You don't understand. This whole town is in danger.You can't do that. You don't have the right!But...Shit...Who?Oh my God. It's started.I already told you how it would happen.It's not shit.When I was put under, Freddy was released. I know this because I dreamed it.Yes. Wesley was his first victim.You said it yourself. How could it have been a cigarette?Call me crazy...but I think he's after Rosedale. The whole place. In my dream he said something about needing a few souls to get the job done. I think he has to kill in order to get the power to suck in a new town.Thank you. There's more. There are... other people in there. In the nightmares.No. Different. There are three of them. They're dressed in black. They have powers like Freddy, but they seem to be on our side.Well, you gotta hang in there with me on this one. They call themselves... the Dream Police.I guess.They're kids that Freddy killed years ago. THEY don't even know how they got there. But they're somehow patrolling dreamworld to put a stop to Krueger.They say they need help. I don't know what or why...yet.Hey, I'm trying to save all of us.By then it'll be too late. It was too late for Wesley.I know. It's my fault.It's too late for that. I have to stay and try and put a stop to it.I wish I could convince you of the danger you and the others are in.This is worse than anything you can imagine.I'm sorry.So did my mom. She taught me a lot about dreams.She told me that a lot of people have special dream powers. I inherited some from her - and some I have all to myself. She showed me how I could link up with other people's dreams - to actually be inside with them.A little hard to imagine, huh?I can convince you.Easy. We're doing it now.I mean we're dreaming. You and me. Together.It's true. We're really doing it.We'll compare notes when we wake up. Then you'll know.Sometimes. It's not as easy as linking up, though.Show off.I think I like you the way you always are.Karen, no!Come on!You heard me. I said wake up!This is a dream! You have to get out of here. I'm not hurting you, only he can really do that! Wake up now!Are you hurt?If he had done it, you'd be dead.Or the right one?That's something else my mom taught me.What the hell is that supposed to mean?You better watch your mouth, pal.Go ahead and be a tough guy, Scott. Krueger will cut you to pieces before you can even flex a muscle.Nothing happened between us last night.I'm sorry, but...You don't understandIt's a free country.Yes, sir.You're supposed to be off-limits to me.Wonderful.I'm going to go to bed soon.I have to find the Dream Police. I think I'm somehow their link to all this. They only seem to appear when I'm around. You woke me up before I had a chance to talk to them last night.your fault. I have to ask them what we're supposed to do to help them. And maybe I can protect Gina while I'm in there.He's on his own.I don't mean to be cold,but we've done everything to convince him. Gina's too scared to understand. I think Freddy will go after her next.You have to stay awake.You have to try.Okay. Be careful.Come on!I'm here to help!No no no no!You let him get away!What...there are rules to all this?The rest? You mean the kids at the home?How?Gina!No. It's Freddy.You're kicking us out?Aw, Jesus...If it's still here.Nothing.It's over. We're finished. He's won.Do what? I'm not doing anything.Because we're fucked. The last thing the Dream Police told me was that they needed all our help. Together. Even if we weren't about to be split up there aren't enough of us left to make a difference.I don't. But, it's all just too much. I've tried so hard and nothing's worked. I'm spent. I'm wasted. I'm...I'm so tired.And we're not going to waste it.We'll have help.Right.Fine. You got a deal. And you won't be disappointed.I hope so. Then I got to make sure we all end up in Springwood.Yeah. Only right now it's not a very pretty place.Play it by ear. And try and stay alive.Off we go.I'm home.Scott, are you with us?Then we wait.All that's left.What's the plan?Then let's do it.Oh no...Mother?Krueger...I'm sorry, Scott.What! How?Then who's going to kill this fucker?How the hell am I supposed to do that?I think I know where...No time. You guys find Karen!The feeling is mutual.I told them to look for you. What are you doing here? Don't you know what this place is?You've got to get out of here.You don't understand. The Police can't kill Freddy. They literally chopped each other to pieces and he's still alive! Now I'm supposed to figure out how to get rid of him.Okay, so he's a bad artist.Yeah...But in reality Freddy hasn't lived here for decades.All evils from all times in history...But what does this do for us?Okay, but we're not going to stand around here to figure out how. It's too dangerous.Karen...dream...powers....I'll be back...", "clean_line": "hear noise excuse sound different engines getting louder um okay yeah yeah mom fine way hell coming dreamed away born mom said couldn come leave fucker mom going place oh lighten mister kind kind swell ve got couple questions love parents alive like think stronger word okay jacob yeah haven eat lately incredible best ve ve road couple days jacob johnson springwood upstate miles father died born mother dead yes sir hi dead alright know smoke problem happened sleep fine thanks yeah problem okay shit happened jesus thanks talk right ll tell later promise think jesus fucking oh shit huh going tired right says know people know sleep haven physical reason sharks sleep pump water gills moving stop breath sleep die know kid worry wes sleep everybody tell mean haunts dreams kills die real know sounds crazy swear true went bed night woke middle road freddy krueger killed mother blasted town nightmare worst think wants use kill kids bring towns world sure think kind carrier inside soon fall deep sleep ll let loose guys great want thank getting killed ve trying tell nightmare notices difference believe feels good fucked huh haven told place yeah great let sleep okay yeah thank god leaving hurt gone maybe ll desert ll lie middle finally sleep krueger feed dreams snakes vultures trying protect understand mad going convince huh yeah sure nooooooo nooooo let understand let fucking ll set free want leave town dead body alright hell guys hello butt ask stupid questions guys understand going ve told said fine friends trouble understand town danger right shit oh god started told happen shit freddy released know dreamed yes wesley victim said cigarette crazy think rosedale place dream said needing souls job think kill order power suck new town thank people nightmares different dressed black powers like freddy gotta hang dream police guess kids freddy killed years ago know got patrolling dreamworld stop krueger need help know hey trying save ll late late wesley know fault late stay try stop wish convince danger worse imagine sorry mom taught lot dreams told lot people special dream powers inherited showed link people dreams actually inside little hard imagine huh convince easy mean dreaming true ll compare notes wake ll know easy linking think like way karen come heard said wake dream hurting wake hurt dead right mom taught hell supposed mean better watch mouth pal ahead tough guy scott krueger cut pieces flex muscle happened night sorry understandit free country yes sir supposed limits wonderful going bed soon dream police think link appear woke chance talk night fault ask supposed help maybe protect gina mean cold ve convince gina scared understand think freddy stay awake try okay careful come help let away rules rest mean kids home gina freddy kicking aw jesus finished won fucked thing dream police told needed help weren split aren left difference ve tried hard worked spent wasted tired going waste ll help right fine got deal won disappointed hope got sure end springwood yeah right pretty place play ear try stay alive home scott wait left plan let oh mother krueger sorry scott going kill fucker hell supposed think know time guys karen feeling mutual told look know place ve got understand police kill freddy literally chopped pieces alive supposed figure rid okay bad artist yeah reality freddy hasn lived decades evils times history okay going stand figure dangerous karen dream powers ll"}, "KAREN": {"raw_line": "Free speech. The right of assembly.It's a home. A foster home. For teenagers. It's where you go when things get bad. It's the place to figure out what to do next. It's a home for kids that no one else wants. It's MY home.What have we ever done to you?Assholes.Yeah. Thanks. I'm Karen.Are YOU okay?Then come help me unpack.I guess the sandwich is alright, huh?You're not from around here, are you?Do you need a place to stay?What's wrong?This is Jacob.They run this house. They're helping me and three other ids get a footing in reality before they kick us out of the nest to make room for the next batch.A little. Jacob came to my rescue.Jacob's a little down on his luck. I told him he could stay here a few days.Just for a little while. So he can get his bearings.Thanks, David.Hey, guys, I got someone for you to meet. This is Jacob. Jacob, this is Wesley and Gina.He's going to be staying with us for a while.Hi, Scott.This is Jacob Johnson. He's a new resident. At least temporarily.No, I believe that honor goes to Wesley.Mellow out, Scott. Give him a chance to settle in.His dad used to beat him. One day he couldn't take it any more.He killed him with his father's gun. Self-defense.Yeah. Right.Why don't you go to bed?You need to talk?She doesn't like to be touched.Don't take it personally. It's not her fault.Her mother was a hooker. She forced Gina to carry on the tradition. When she was thirteen...You look terrible.I'm sorry...I just wish you'd tell me what happened to you, that's all.Okay. Why don't you sit and rest for a bit. The supervisor's not around. You look like you could use it.How?I don't know.I'm not sure. I guess, I guess I see a lot of me in you.Yeah. That must be it.I can't talk about it right now. Maybe later. Do you want me to stay with you?I'll do my best.Where are you going?Why?Fine. You're just going to take off then...Right. You blow into town and then blow right out. Terrific.You just don't get it, do you?Running away doesn't help.Maybe.Jacob!Jacob, it'll be alright.Wes...They said he fell asleep smoking.And how could he...dire that way and not wake up?Like him?Who are they?Where are they from?They're going to use all this to shut us down.You going to try to run away again?I'm sorry. It's all so hard to accept.I've been in danger before. THAT I can handle.I wouldn't be so sure about that. Come on. Let's go inside.She was great. Loving. Supportive, caring - everything a mom should be. Except she had one fatal flow: my father. You see, she was raised at a time when they still had the \"obey\" part in the wedding vows. He was always jealous. She couldn't talk to another man without him thinking she wanted to go to bed with him. He never hit me. But the things he did to her...and she would always just take it. She never fought back. He'd get drunk and...she'd tell people she just fell down or something. Then one night...I was thirteen. Something happened. My mom suddenly wouldn't take it anymore. Something made her say enough is enough. She hit back. Tat only made it worse. I watched as he hit her over and over. Then he knocked her down the stairs. She broke her neck. And when y father saw what he'd done - he finally became human. He cried over her body for a while, then went into the garage and blew his brains out with a shotgun. To this day I don't remember what that final straw was. The shrinks say I've blocked it out of my memory. There's no one else alive who knows what really happened. I have dreams about it sometimes, but there's always that blank spot. A missing piece.I know nightmares are real, Jacob. I know.Like what?That sounds wonderful. But...I don't know...Yeah. I'm sorry.How?What do you mean?I don't believe it.But what if I'm just dreaming of you telling me that?Did you bring us here on purpose? Can you go anywhere you want?Wow, I never knew...When things get bad it helps to be someone else. I use it to protect myself.Look!Oh no...Why are you doing this?What?How? This is my old house. How did I get here?I think I get it now.You hit me.Um...no.You better get back to your room. We don't want anybody to get the wrong idea.Get out of here.No. Not tonight.I'm telling you, this Freddy guy is for real.Jacob was in there with me.I have the picture in my room if you want to see it. He brought it out from the nightmare.That picture was destroyed years ago.You should be scared.It's okay. The Ross's have gone to a council meeting and Scott's in his room. We should be safe for awhile.Jacob, what are we going to do?Now you WANT to sleep?I'm sorry. I was scared.What about Scott?Oh...What should I do?That's not going to be easy. I'm half asleep already.I'd better get out of here.YOU be careful. I'm not going anywhere.Is it an earthquake?They can't do that.No, please.What's going to happen to you?What about it?Will we be able to go back to the Ross's?Will we be together?Jacob, what are we going to do?What do you mean, nothing?How can you do this?Exactly. After all we've been through you just throw in the towel. Why?How do you know that?So you're just going to give up? I'll bet that's something your mother never taught you.Scott, we need you.I'm going to be sleeping in the girl's dorm. Will you be able to bring me in?What do we do when we get there?Scott! You're here.Uh-huh. Real friendly, too.And I'm in it with you. Convinced?Nope. I tired that one already. Doesn't work. Come on, we have to find Jacob.Jacob! Thank God!What now?No more...Jacob! You scared the shit out of me!Where are the Dream Police?I do now. Look what I found.Wait. You have to see this.But I think I found the answer. Shut up for a second and look at these.No! You told me Krueger's mother committed suicide and no one knows who his father was, right?Freddy's been pushing all our buttons with our pasts. These are HIS past. Don't you get it? HE was a foster child, too!Like you tried to tell me once before, this is a dream. Who knows why this is all here.And isn't this where it all started in Springwood? On Elm Street?There's got to be a way to use it against him.No no no no no no no...Jacob...Oh no...You're NOT my father.Mommy, no!Yes.
