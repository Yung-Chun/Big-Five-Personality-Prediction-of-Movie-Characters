{"Space-Milkshake": {"ANTON": {"raw_line": "Do you have any fruits, vegetables, or other food products?Fever, stuffy nose, cold symptoms?Have you worked on the WENDI series computer systems before?Call me Anton. ANTON BALVENIE snatches the documents, and walks away as he reads. Jimmy follows him.We're very informal around here.Jimmy Anderson, United Spaceworkers Orbital 108 since 2147, allergic to pollen. Certified level... nine rating?Level 9 engineers aren't rated for central systems repair.We got you up here, I'll put you to work.Let me clue you in. Up here the work never stops. There's always orbital debris piling up and someone has to be in each sector with a line of sight on it to keep launch vectors clear. Do you follow me?I'm not a chief I'm a Captain.Just make sure you finish by zero eight hundred Zulu. I'm not signing overtime forms. Do you know how to fix mess hall food dispensers?All it's giving is sandwiches. That's your next job after the mainframe.The terminal on the fritz is over there. Jimmy sees Tilda.That's Lieutenant Tilda Genero. You don't need to talk to her. Tilda glances at him and turns her chair away from him. Jimmy drags his suitcase, hitting everything, and dumps out electronic junk near the terminal. He opens up a panel near a screen showing static.And the sonovac coffee machine is malfunctioning. Can you fix that?Whatever, get it done. Anton goes to another terminal and uses the computer.What do they want now?Looks too small for a laser sweep.No. Keep working. Anton hits some keys, then presses the radio button.This is Captain Balvenie of sanitation station eight five one eight. Who the hell is telling my operations officer how to do her job?You have to send someone else. Our main computer is down for service.Not our problem. The book says it's too small for lasers. Check your book down there.Where's Valentina? Why am I dealing with these guys? It's her shift.Valentina to the control room immediately please. Valentina to the control room.We don't take pods out for class two debris.Sanitation Station Regina out. Anton switches off the radio.Morons.Oh, you'd like lunch? Know what I'd like? I'd like my computer fixed right now. Fix it.That's Captain Balvenie.Are there any salvage crews in the sector?You think there's something good in there?Well I'm calling it.Match orbit and position for pod launch. Run the checklist. Valentina report to airlock two. We're going fishing. Anton runs out.I'm not cutting in the new guy.I got here first. And you handle the heat better. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 12.Fine, fine. There's nothing wrong with the other suit anyway. I don't care.I said fine. Anton takes the other suit. It's very smelly. He takes off his shirt and pants and they both dress in space suits. [Simple montage of zipping, buckling, boots, gloves.]This could be the haul we've been waiting for. They're flipping out over this cargo drone.I don't know. It must be worth something.Ya I see it. Line us up. They work the controls. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 13.Ground control, this is our sector and we need to keep this space clear. We got all kinds of transports coming through today.They really want whatever was on that shuttle. It's going to be good. Anton pulls out sandwiches from a pouch with difficulty and eats.You got the good space suit. Valentina looks at him, stops steering the pod.Fine. God damn it. Take the ham. He gives her the ham sandwich. They eat and fly the pod.Almost full. Lets dump this load and try for another pass.It's fine. Skip the safety check, we've got two minutes left. Once it's onboard, it's ours.Did they just shoot at us?I'm seeing spots.Where's everything? They stare at the monitors, growing confused.Tilda, can you raise ground control?It's not the sensors. Something happened. We're heading back in.Any luck with Ground control?Yeah, we saw it too.Who said you could take a break?Report to me in ten. Tilda rolls her eyes and goes.Jimmy, how are the repairs coming? Jimmy? Get on the intercom Jimmy.You'd better be getting all over this mainframe problem. I want hourly reports every half hour.Just get on it, God damn it!I'm trying to figure out what you're doing wrong. She slams shut a procedure binder. Jimmy comes in.I don't see how that's possible. It has to be a communications problem.Any luck?You're worried. Don't worry. We're going to be fine. He leans in to give her a kiss, she leans away from his kiss as she stretches. He sits to stretch next to her.Not this again. Val-It's all the same.What about us? What about me?If this is because of the other night, I already told you that was because of the bad egg sandwiches I ate after the refrigeration system went down. That was a one-off thing. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 22.Is it the sex?Then what's your problem? She continues her stretching and workout.We need to take breaks. Keep to a schedule. Schedule says scrabble. How's your sandwich?Well that's all there is until breakfast tomorrow.Sandwiches.Can you repair food dispensers?Well then there's nothing else.So Jimmy, is there someone back on earth waiting for you?Do you actually have a girlfriend?Are you actually friends?Hi Tilda. Want a sandwich? We saved you the pickled onion and cheese. She ignores them.What are you looking for? What's she looking for?I'm making a word. Tilda knocks little containers around searching the cupboards. She carelessly knocks things off the shelf.Tilda would you stop making that racket? What the hell are you looking for?I don't rush into things and make irrational snap decisions, like some people.It's totally inexplicable. Jimmy gets up.Sit down. We're playing scrabble. A FLASH outside the window. Tilda turns, very scared, and looks out the window. Jimmy goes to the window next to her.That was an impact.Pressure nominal. Jimmy, check the CNW3. That thing there.Orbital position? Jimmy?The other console.Collision checklist?Where did it hit us? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 26.It looks like... I don't know. An asteroid would have done more damage.Val, meet me in the airlock module right away. Tilda turns to face them. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 27.Is this your rubber duckie?It was dented into the outer hull. Valentina takes the duckies and walks off.You tell me. Anton follows her.How many of those things do you have?They're identical. Why would you deny it's yours? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 27A.Do you know something about this? Tilda walks away.Not to me.I hadn't noticed.Your shift started ten minutes ago. Valentina sips coffee at the table as Jimmy walks past. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 29.Finally! Wendi?Wendi? Respond. The computer's voice is glitchy at first, then improves. It now sounds male.Why does it have a man's voice?I like the old voice better. Fix the voice.That was the rubber duck. Jimmy types on the keyboard.Well done, Jimmy.Wendi? They look at Jimmy with every kind of hate.Fix it.Sure. She's useless to me. Tilda, help Jimmy. Tilda walks away.Or go. That's fine too. Work on that attitude Tilda. Am I the only one trying to maintain order on this station? I'm telling you it's lonely at the top. Jimmy tries to appreciate this.You have to connect the words. Jimmy knocks the board up in nervous reaction to hide the message.Did I startle you? I'm everywhere Jimmy. I've got my eye on you. Is that my jumpsuit? Who said you could wear my jumpsuit?You have to earn that uniform. You can't just put it on. Wash it carefully, fold it and put it back. Jimmy gets up, hesitantly leaves Tilda.And you, shape up. Anton goes to his quarters.What is so special about that rubber duck? Why do you keep it around? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 33A.Fond? Anton takes one and looks at the V+G written on the bottom.Are they more fond or less fond than memories of me?So, whoever gave you the rubber duck has nothing to do with your change of heart.Oh, Gary? So we have a name now. Right... Gary. So what's Gary up to these days? Do you keep in touch? Valentina grabs her duck, bath robe and towel from the room.You've just happen to have a growing collection of his bath toys.We are? Val grabs her 2nd duckie from Anton and exits.Since when?You didn't fix the voice. Jimmy quickly switches off the video monitor screen and turns around. Anton comes in.What's the male version of Wendi? Winston? Walter? Walter.We're calling you Walter from now on. Okay Walter? Walter. Respond. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 36A.See if you can fix the coffee machine next.How should I know?Go look in the salvage bay, there's probably something you can use.Now.Wendi, Check your files on crew psychology, and emergency situation management. Cancel that. Anything on relationship counselling?No. Hold on.Abort! Anton ponders.What do you have on Valentina's work history?Did she work with someone named Gary?Who is this guy?Yes yes. I mean what was he like? Did he have a lot of girlfriends? Do you have any vital statistics, medical records, history of sexually transmitted diseases? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 39.Pictures with his shirt off like at a beach maybe? Any data on his anatomy? Anton leans close to a screen that scrolls data.My god he was hung like a donkey.What was he known for? Did he have a good sense of humor? Was it better than mine?That doesn't sound like sexy or glamorous work does it? It sounds like a lot of math.So how long did Val and Gary work together?Did they go on any trips together?You're completely useless Wendi, you know that? Absolutely stupid and useless. What good are you? Anton goes back into his game of SPACE WAR.How's it going Tilda? Tilda stares at him.Since all these strange events started you haven't said a word, haven't slept at all as far as I can see. I've noticed. You haven't eaten. I can see you're deeply troubled by what's happening. Frankly, I'm a little disappointed that you haven't held it together. You're a trained officer. Things might be a bit grim but I assure you I've made it through worse situations than this. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 41A.You just need a positive attitude. Try a smile once in a while. Can you do that? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 42.Let a smile be your umbrella. Can you get back on the team? Tilda stares at him.I'm not hearing an answer. Jimmy comes in with the Time Cube and cables from the salvage room and puts it on the table.What's a Time cube?Now she's mad at me? This one isn't on me.Calm down.Why are you mad at me?If you were in the control room instead of taking baths, you might know what's going on. By the way, you and this Gary guy were a lot more than friends. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 44.Wendi told me.So it's true. I knew it.Lets put the Gary stuff aside. Maybe you used to see him, maybe you were just friends, whatever. The important thing is you're over him and you're with me now. Lets not fight like this.Good.So you don't want to talk right now. I'm going to go get a cup of coffee. Why don't you adjust your attitude and join me when you're ready. Anton goes.No she isn't.Since when?My station is the nexus?Put down the time cube. Jimmy puts it down.Wendi, what's the matter?Jimmy? Didn't you fix that?Val, want to check it out?You want to be involved, this is being involved.Go ahead Val.Okay. Come to the rec room. I made coffee. She turns off the intercom. There's some slime.So... you were saying you came here to replace our Tilda and stop someone from using this Time Cube, but he's not here. And what happened to our Tilda?Is she around here? Somewhere? Anton eats his sandwich.Well, you can see why I'd be concerned to hear a member of my crew is missing.Wait a minute. Gary Pinback?That's the guy who's supposed to be on this station?Son of a bitch.What the hell is going on now?I'm going to the control room. You keep an eye on... the robot. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 51A.I'm telling you, if that son of a bitch is on my station I'm going to find him. You two stay put. Anton leaves. Jimmy sits next to Tilda.What's happened?Gary is onboard the station. Valentina freezes.Have you talked to him?Wendi, is there another man on this station besides myself?Besides Jimmy?Where the hell is he hiding? What are you two up to? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 54.Tilda.You got the second duck from him. Admit that.Fine. Lets start with that.What's the big deal with this cube? SUDDENLY THE ROOM JOLTS. Red warnings on monitors.Jimmy? We've got a situation here. Take Tilda to the computer room and see if you can get the control system back up.I told you to stay put. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 55.Something is definitely wrong. Check the air pressure.What?Oh? The rubber duck scuttles across the floor behind them but Anton doesn't see it. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 56.Where is the bastard? How the hell did he get on the station?When did I do that? Valentina notices that Gary is in front of Anton, hiding on a shelf, dripping slime.Sure. Naturally. He just wants his time cube. He's not interested in you?What the hell is that? Anton moves around and slowly approaches it. He takes out his laser blaster and charges it. The Duck cowers and backs deeper into the corner of the shelf.Anton, you're scaring him.Him? Hello little guy. Don't be afraid. We mean you no harm. Hey there. Val what the hell is this thing? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 57.What? This thing? Anton points his laser. Gary trembles with fear.That's odd. The batteries must be- Gary LEAPS at Anton's head. They crash through the room as it attacks him. Papers fly from binders thrown around. Anton screams. The laser pistol is knocked to the floor, broken. Blood splatters against a console, and across Valentina's face. Val screams, staring at the off-screen attack. Anton is thrown down, he turns around and tries to see where the duck is. He's scratched up. It scuttles away down the hall behind him, out of his sight.Where did that little bastard go?It sure is strong for a little guy.Why didn't you just tell me about him? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 58.It hurts. Valentina sticks a band-aid on Anton.Did you know what this thing was when we brought it on board?Look what he did.Whose side are you on? A noise down the hall. Anton pulls the handlebar off the elliptical exercise machine and holds it like a club as he goes to one side of the room next to the hall.Can you see it?Something is coming. Stay back. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 59.I won't hurt him much. I'll just subdue him, okay? That's fair, isn't it? Jimmy runs around the corner into the room.We have a guest onboard. Tilda follows carrying the Time Cube.A rubber duck attacked me.Yes. And it's growing.Like a small dog maybe. And it bites. Hard. What have you got?God help us.Ah, ham. Give me the ham. Valentina reluctantly gives up the ham sandwich. They eat. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 61.The duck... is Gary.Valentina has something she'd like to tell us.Go on. Please.And I'm going to kill him.He tried to eat my face, Val.I'm with Tilda on this one for now.Sorry Val. Plan A: we get control of Gary. We're going to assume he's only going to keep smashing things. Jimmy, Tilda, work on Wendi. If we can get eyes on him and close doors remotely we can trap him- Another SMASHING noise echoes through the frame of the station. Distant creaking metal sounds.Val and I will look for the duck.You said yourself he's not thinking straight. I'm definitely not giving him the Time Cube - that's what got us into this mess.Everyone take one. They do. Jimmy bends his. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 63.Laser's broke. Make do. Jimmy grabs the pieces of the broken laser pistol, plastic knives and half a sandwich in his pockets, then puts the Time Cube into a backpack. Anton takes the backpack.I'll take that. Jimmy lets him have it.I'll keep it safe.Val?No. We should split up. Use the intercom if you find him.I'm going to ask him nicely to stop destroying my space station for starters. That's reasonable isn't it? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 64.Then I'm going to kill him as hard as I can.Got it! He stomps on it. Squeak Squeak. Squeak.Oh. Anton lifts his foot. It squeaks.It's the normal one. A SCUTTLING SOUND behind them. They turn and look.Tilda, get back. He hands her the backpack with the Time Cube. Tilda takes it and backs away.Stay back.What Time Cube?You come on my space station, try to steal my girlfriend, turn the place upside down and make demands for time cubes. Who do you think I am? Anton prepares to strike. The duck trembles with excitement and rage. Anton grits his teeth.Who's there? Valentina?Something is wrong with you Val. You can't trust someone that wants to eat you.I thought we've had some good times. Anton notices Gary lurking in the hall.Gary? I'll kick your ass. Anton struggles to sit up. He falls back down. Val puts down the time cube on the counter and helps Anton settle down.You pussy, come over here. Afraid to fight like a man? Valentina looks at Anton, looks at Gary, conflicted.If this guy is going to make you happy, go ahead. I understand. Val sees Anton in a different light.It's ok.Is that my blaster?Where is Jimmy?Thanks sweetie. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 89A.I know. She hugs him. He wraps his manly arms around her.Ready.Jimmy? Jimmy snaps out of his daze and hits the intercom button.The... debris warning thing. Get the debris.

Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 3.Allergies.You still have a WENDI? The light turns green and the inner door opens, Jimmy enters the space station airlock module. A sign above the airlock says: \"REMEMBER ALL ACCIDENTS IN SPACE ARE SERIOUS ACCIDENTS\". Jimmy sneezes again, wipes his nose, offers his hand to shake. He reads Anton's name tag.Captain Balvenie?Engineer level nine rating. Anton is unimpressed. Jimmy stops to poke a panel with a loose wire.No, they are. I am. Do you want me to go back? Anton corners Jimmy. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 4.Great. This is my first orbital assignment.No problem chief.Sorry, Captain. They keep walking, reaching the junction at the end.No. Maybe. What's the matter?There's your problem. Jimmy digs around in the panel with wires sticking out.I don't know. I might have to take the mainframe offline to fix this-What's his problem? Tilda ignores him.I said, what's his problem? ... I guess you can't hear me with your headphones on.Do you want me to take a look at the sensors? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 8.Do you know where can I get lunch?Can you show me the way?Ok Anton.What's that? Is everything ok?Do you get down to Earth much? Tilda turns around from her terminal.Do you always share a salvage bonus with the entire crew?But we're four including me.Where's the sign-in sheet? Tilda points at her headphones without turning to him.I'll sign in later I guess.It sounds like he might be holding the microphone too close. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 16.Good salvage?What can I do? Valentina shoves her space suit into Jimmy's hands. She and Anton walk off in the other direction. Jimmy tries to hang up the space suits on the rack. They don't fit. He tries again. Jimmy drops the space suits and follows after Tilda. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 17.Tilda? Jimmy finds a way around a large machine just as Tilda2 zips up her jumpsuit, facing away. She has strange geometric lines like tatoos on her back. He's struck by her picturesque beauty and doesn't realize he's staring. She turns and meets eyes with him. He's very embarrassed and ducks back behind the machine.Is this the laundry room? I was looking for the mess hall. Sorry if I surprised you. I thought I heard something. I didn't see anything. The heavy machinery starts grinding and humming. CRUNCHING, SAWING AND SPLATTERING SOUNDS. The light turns from red to green. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 18.Okay well I'll see you on the bridge. Sorry. Jimmy turns and starts to head out, bumping into Tilda2 with a start. She's different; dissociated, laconic, very nervous.I was just going. Tilda2 stares at him, shivering.Hey, what's the matter? Jimmy pats her shoulder. She looks up and they meet eyes.Are you ok? She turns and runs away. Jimmy watches her go out the hatch.You forgot your shoes! Jimmy picks up some sneakers. He doesn't notice blood dripping out from below the organic waste reprocessor as he goes.Wendi?Where is the laundry room?Does Tilda have a boyfriend? The intercom buzzes. Anton voice is distorted to the edge of comprehensibility.Anton?I can't understand-Roger that. Jimmy opens the top binder from a tall stack of binders. The screen turns off.Wendi? He hits buttons. It doesn't work now.It's taking me a bit longer than I thought. I might need to call down for some parts.Why didn't anyone tell me? I have to get back to Earth.So we're stranded. The full weight of their predicament settles on them. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 21.Do I have to play?Not very good. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 23.What's for breakfast?Is there anything to eat besides sandwiches?No.Yes. I have a girlfriend.There's a girl I'm friends with, I was planning on asking her to out.We know each other. I know her.You guys need a minute?What was that? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 25.I don't know what I'm looking at.Orbital position is...Got it. The fail-safe thrusters kicked in. Orbit is stable. Tilda comes in and sits at a console, hits buttons.What is that?It's small... and yellow.Why don't you give her a break?Take it easy.They're not identical. See? Tilda comes between them and checks out the ducks urgently. Jimmy leans in next to her.What is it Tilda?Did you lose something? Tilda puts her finger to her lips like Shhhh and walks past him out into the hall.Wendi? Nothing happens. He presses some buttons and reads more. Jimmy kicks the computer in frustration. Tilda comes in. She looks all around the room and at the computer.Oh hey Tilda! What are you looking for? Tilda pokes the computer.Have you worked in space a long time? I'm still getting used to it. I thought I'd like it better. A lot less excitement than I figured. I guess it's a good thing though - after what happened to Earth. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 30.I mean, whatever happened out there we're still alive. What do you think happened? Tilda looks at Jimmy. She places her hand on the computer.I'm testing the circuits coming off the recursive logic decoupler for a memory leak. Want to help? Tilda kicks the computer. The computer screen flickers on and numbers scroll on the monitor.Why don't you say anything? Jimmy hits the intercom button.Anton? I fixed the computer. Tilda sits down and flips through a binder. Jimmy sits close to her.I know you're looking for something. I can help. Just tell me. Tilda is about to say something- but Valentina comes in.It's loading. The screen settles on the \"W.A.S.S. REGINA\" station logo.I don't know what happened. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 32.I think Tilda can help.Hi Tilda. Trouble sleeping? Tilda looks at him.Want to play scrabble?What's happening to us Tilda? What's with the rubber ducks? She looks at him.Anton thinks you're space-crazy. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 33.Sometimes you do seem kind of distant. Tilda turns the board to face her.I guess you're just dealing with things in your own way. Tilda has an idea! She grabs all the tiles and starts making words. SECRET. INTRUDER ON BOARD. DANGER. Jimmy leans over looking. Tilda is very serious. Anton leans in .I didn't pack anything else.Wendi, can you identify me?How are you doing? Jimmy types, flips switches, leafs through binders and tests circuits under the following scene. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 35.It looks like your social interface program is back online.Why do you have a man's voice?Anton hates it.No stay like this. Can you show me the station video monitors? A grid of grainy black and white video cameras comes up. One screen shows Valentina walking down the hall angrily with her bath robe, towel and 2 rubber duckies. Another monitor shows a medium shot of Tilda kneeling in engineering area next to a wall panel marked T518. She looks around nervously and opens it.Why are women so complicated? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 36.What's your T518 array used for?Have you ever been in love, Wendi?It's stuck this way.I knew a guy named Wendi. I called him Wendi once. Maybe by mistake. I think his name was Wendal.What's wrong with the coffee machine?I'm not sure this power converter is going to hold and we're out of spares. Wendi could go down again.Ok.Oh, ok. Jimmy gets up and goes.What the heck is this? He fumbles and drops it. A FLASH of light whites-out the room. Jimmy rubs his eyes and looks at the box - blue lights glow inside and it starts to HUM.Is that what it is?What do you mean by activate? I mean it was on when I found it. Valentina comes in with her bath robe. She sees them and the Time Cube.I thought all life on earth ended last week. Valentina throws down her bath robe and goes to her quarters.What is this?Oh yeah? He reaches for it...Oh. Jimmy pulls his hand back and sits on his hands looking at the cube.You are? Tilda puts her finger near Jimmy's arm. A small spark jumps.Ow. Do that again. She does it again.Ow. Stop.Do it again.Tilda's a robot.I'm pretty sure she is. Valentina comes in, sees the Time Cube glowing. Anton pulls out a chair for her.It's okay, tell them what you told me.It's got some kind of port at the bottom which I haven't figured out.No. Not really. It turned itself on. I might have dropped it. It was on before I found it. BEEP BEEP BEEP - a beeping sound.Yes. This is new. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 48.She has a name. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 52.Hey. What's the matter?We can try. Look, last week I never thought I'd be working orbit. Everyone told me it was impossible. I didn't have the training. I didn't have the stomach. People said, that Jimmy, he's never getting off Earth. But I got myself together and paid a guy a hundred and fifty bucks to forge my certification forms and the next thing you know, here I am.I'm sure you didn't. Hey, lets go use Wendi's cameras to see if we can find Gary if he's on board.I'm glad you can speak. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 53.What is it?We're in the computer room.Ok. He turns off the intercom.Do you know what's happening?Not much time like a few days?I'm looking for you!What happened to your face?What?So it's some kind of animal?How big is it?We checked with Wendi. It doesn't look like Gary is on board.This is the Gary that Tilda says destroyed Earth. He's a duck?Me too.Do we have any weapons? Anton opens a drawer. He spills out a handful of disposable plastic knives on the table.No lasers? Microwave rifles?What is it? Tilda gives Jimmy a little kiss. Suddenly his eyes open wide as something happens when their lips touch, time slows down and everything gets brighter, fades to:This is cool. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 65.Woah.I have a headache. But it was nice.You know, we can try other ways of showing how we feel. There are ways we do it in this dimension you might not have heard about yet... The ROOM SHAKES HARD and binders fall off the shelves, the lights flicker, metal snapping NOISES O.S.Right.The power system is still on. We need to locate the damaged circuits. They could be anywhere between here and the control room. Gary must have done something.What are you going to do?Ok. Jimmy turns around. Tilda sticks the RS232 cable down the front of her jumpsuit bottoms area and feels around with the cable until she finds her socket. CLICK.Can you explain what you're doing? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 67.I mean what are you doing with that RS232 cable? Numbers flash on the screen.Gary? What is it trying to do?How long do we have?Are you sure? She's sure. Jimmy hits the intercom.Anton? Anton? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 68.You're going to have to explain that later. Tilda reaches her hand toward Jimmy. Jimmy puts his hand out. A spark jumps between their hands.Ow!Meat that loves you, Tilda.It sure would be fun to try. Tilda smiles in agreement.Ow. Stop.Where's Anton?We're falling out of orbit. Gary's done something to the guidance system. Have you found him?Then there's only one place left he could be.Tilda? Tilda comes out of Anton's room, some blood spray on her face.Valentina, get some water. Tilda first-aid examines Anton. He coughs up blood. Jimmy turns around and there's no Valentina.Valentina? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 72.Are you going to be OK here?Where did you go? Anton is hurt pretty bad.He's in the storage bay, going towards the crew quarters. Tilda and I managed to reroute the door controls. If I can just figure out... Jimmy hits buttons.Ha. Sucker. Jimmy dramatically hits a big button on the keyboard.He's locked in. That should buy us some time but we have to hurry. Help me figure out the thruster controls. Valentina creeps up right behind Jimmy. Jimmy turns to see her too late: she bashes Jimmy in the head with the tool box and tosses it aside. Valentina uses the keyboard. Jimmy rolls over, regains focus.What are you doing?Where are you going? Tilda appears behind Valentina and hits her in the back of her head with the toolbox. Valentina goes down. Valentina rubs her head. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 76.Thanks Tilda. Oh no, she let Gary loose.He's a monster.That's bad, isn't it? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 77.There's too much damage to fix in fifteen minutes.We can't allow Gary to have total control of time and space. Jimmy gets back down into the computer panel. Tilda kneels next to him, watching. Valentina looks at the Time Cube on the floor and wriggles in her duct tape bonds.We're falling Wendi. Correct our orbital position.Is anything working?We have... fourteen minutes. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 78.It's ugly in here. I don't know where the break is.How's it going?! Jimmy is jammed deep in the panel, where he uses a circuit tester, probing. He wipes off his sweaty brow.Here? Tilda is focused on the monitors, doesn't notice Valentina is loose of her duct tape and stands up behind them.Is this it?Here?There's your problem. He pulls out a smoldering burned circuit.The midrange data processor is burned out. I think we need it to control the thrust vector.No way. No... I don't have the parts. This is serious.We're dead.I wish you would warn me if you're going to do something like that.Don't you need it?Where's Val? Tilda turns.Hold on, let me plug this in. Jimmy ducks back under the panel and stuffs the strange device into the socket of the circuit board. Sparks fly and lights start blinking! The SOUND of the midrange data processor humming back to life. Green lights on monitors. Jimmy clamps alligator clips around a broken cable and scrambles up. The monitor screens show green blinking symbols. Tilda uses a staple gun to close her wound, showing no sign of pain, tucks away her RS232 cable and zips up.It worked! Jimmy sees one monitor still shows ERROR.It's not working.It should have worked.Are you okay?How?You mean outside?Take this. Jimmy hands Tilda Anton's blaster - Jimmy found time to repair it with wires, duct tape, and junk.I'll be ok. Jimmy gets up to go, summons his courage.It's go time.Damn. Jimmy frantically sorts through space suit parts. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 85.I'm entering the airlock.Gah! POV Jimmy: splatter and mucus on the inside of the glass.I'm outside the station.Okay no problem.Almost there. Tilda? Tilda?How the hell does this work? Jimmy finds a small keypad and joystick in the panel. He hits buttons. Jimmy turns the joystick. The thruster next to him moves.Okay. That's good.Here goes nothing. He's sweating profusely. He looks at his glove - it's burning. There's orange-glowing cinders flying off his boots. Jimmy hits the big red button! A BLAST OF PLASMA fires out of the thruster next to him. Over the course of five long seconds, the station stops falling. The thruster stops firing. He's burning more now. His suit POPS A LEAK! Smoke whizzes out of a hole in his arm. He stares at it.Oh crap.Are we ok?I could eat another.Ham. She pulls another sandwich from the shelf.Nice. The Time Cube is on the floor with cables running into it from all over. Tilda checks the cables.Control room, are you ready?We're activating it. Jimmy hits keys on a keyboard. All the computer screens turn on. The strange HUMMING sound starts. The Time Cube GLOWS BLUE. The lights dim slightly.I think it's working.Wendi? What's going on? Is it working?Maybe I should-Yeah. We're okay.

happened? Is that the collision alarm?Are we saying three way split on salvage?That's the good space suit.Forget it then. Anton takes off his space-pants and hands them to Valentina.I just took a bath.Why are we bothering with this?What is it?If there's a big salvage bonus, I want to go somewhere with a beach. Looks like something over there.Did you bring one for me? Anton hands her a sandwich.Veggie? Have you got ham?Got it. Closing the hatch. Hatch secure. Looks like there may be an active energy source in there. A clunk noise. Anton checks his watch.I don't know. Hold on.Sensors are down. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 15.Where's the debris field?Tilda, look out the window. Are you seeing anything? The pod sensors are blank.Was it a Solar flare?We're fine. I'll get on the coms. Check out what that humming noise is. We might have taken damage.This is the western alliance sanitation station Regina, in orbit, does anyone receive this message? Please respond. This is the sanitation station Regina, Please respond. She puts down the microphone, tweaks some knobs and pushes some buttons. Anton comes over to her and presses buttons at her station.What are you doing?Have you got the mainframe back up?There's nothing out there.We're having a communication problem right now. I'm telling you there's nothing out there. We need Wendi to do an analysis.That's not happening any time soon.No.I'm going to put in for reassignment.There's always something on deep space transports. A chance to see the galaxy a little.Then maybe I'll realize what I'm missing and come back.I'm sick of you. I want to puke every time I hear your voice. You completely disgust me in every way.It isn't because you had indigestion.The sex is fine.\"Giraffe.\" Eighteen points. Anton writes down the score. Jimmy turns the board to face him. Jimmy places tiles as he eats his soy protein sandwich. He spells \"blorxr\" and writes down his points. Valentina eyeballs him. Anton rotates the game board. He ponders what word to make. He moves his letters around.That's not a word.Thirty seconds Anton.Twenty seconds.Times up Anton. Minus one point. Tilda comes in and looks through the cupboards in the kitchen. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 24.Fifteen seconds overtime. Hurry up and make a word.Five seconds.You need to make decisions faster.Leaving you isn't a snap decision.Nice of you to join us, Tilda. Valentina looks through binders stacked on a shelf, finds one, pulls it, and flips to a page.Working on it.He's almost there. He's got it. Tilda, make sure our orbit is locked. Tilda! Tilda sits facing away from them, worried.Snap out of it Tilda.Did you say something?Don't get on my bad side Jimmy.Hmm.It looks like it.How did this get into space?One. Anton picks them up, looks them all over, looks at the bottoms. One says V+G, the other says G+V underneath.Because it's not. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 28.Has she said anything today?She's acting weird.Coffee machine is still broken. It barely made one cup so there's nothing left for you. Fix it today please. Jimmy walks past Val's room, glances in. From his pov sees...You did it. Took you long enough. Anton comes in.Wendi; status report. Numbers scroll on the screen. Cryptic shapes. Progress bars.Wendi, can you reach ground control? Numbers scroll on the screen.Wendi, what happened to us? The computer screens flicker off with a `power down' sound.Fond memories.Yes. What's wrong with that? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 34.I don't know. It's not all about you. I want to get off this station Anton. I wanted out of here before we were stranded. I need a change of scenery. I'm sick of this place.No. It has nothing to do with Gary.I haven't spoken to him in years. He was just a friend.This is none of your business. You and I are separated now.Where did you come from? She puts the ducks in the water with her. The ducks bob on the soapy waves.What the hell is that humming sound? Hello? Anton? Anton?What the hell is going on? I heard this strange humming noise...Great Anton.She's speaking now? Since when? And why is she telling you all these things and not me?I am calm. Valentina throws a towel at him.Because you're excluding me.How would you know?That's an invasion of my privacy.You're right Anton. Anton is encouraged by her sweet voice and friendly tone.What's the point of me fighting with a shit for brains, whiney little half pint control freak with no balls, stinky stupid fuck with no sense of style, charm or personal hygiene.Nice to hear you speaking again Tilda. Valentina sits away from Anton.We've all heard you speak.But we didn't activate anything. Did you turn it on? Jimmy lifts the box.Did you turn it on?Why me?Fine. Keep an eye on the robot.Nominal, Nominal, five by five... She hits the intercom.Anton?It looks like a false alarm.Who's been messing with the- Valentina looks to her left. There's a rubber duck sitting there. She's confused. It moves toward her. She's paralyzed with horror. It has tentacles peeking out under it.Oh my god. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 49.What the... Fff... Duck?What do you want?You can't be... Gary?How did this happen, Gary? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 51.For me?Gary... That was years ago.That sounds painful.Gary?I don't know. The control relays are all offline.What?No.Get off my case Anton. I don't know what you're talking about. Who said Gary is here?She says she's a robot. Do you believe everything everyone tells you?If you want answers we should go down there and grill the robot.She's probably the one who blew out the control systems. Whatever we do, we can't leave them with the cube anymore.Anton?Anton!Okay. I haven't been totally honest.Gary is onboard.You brought him in.He's just come for the time cube. That's all he needs to get back to his dimension and put things right. Its eyes glow faintly red.He's the only one that can send us home and set things right. Anton follows her gaze and sees the duck there.That's Gary. Anton slowly moves closer to it.No! Anton pulls the trigger. It goes click click.I told you to be careful.I tried to tell you. Valentina cleans his cut. She digs through the kit for tape.How is your head?No, of course not.He was frightened.No. Anton peeks down the hall quickly. He reaches to draw his laser blaster - his holster is empty.Anton wait!Rice, butter, carrot jam.Ham.I don't know all the facts.The time cube sent him here through the duck. It was an accident.He's on this station. He's part man, part rubber duck, part something else.How is that going to help?He's going through a lot of changes. He's not thinking straight. But he's the only one that set things right if we give him the Time Cube.I suppose you've helped us? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 62.You're what?Shut up Jimmy, no one asked you. METAL CREAKING NOISE O.S., sound of cables snapping.No.Gary? Anton pokes his head in.Did you see him?What are you going to do with him Anton?I suppose.Gary? Are you there Gary? We have to talk. She opens the compartment - just a pair of dusty headphones inside. She relaxes. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 69.You scared the crap out of me.We split up. What are you doing here?He's not between here and engineering.Gary. Why are you doing this? Gary's voice answers from the shadows. It sounds bigger.But you'll kill me as well if the station falls out of orbit.I was for a while. Not sure now.I don't know.I know. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 73.You're mutating faster and faster.You didn't need to hurt him Gary. Gary's eyes glimmer in the darkness. Some tentacle too.Together?That's so sweet. She decides to step into the darkness. A tentacle wraps around her as she disappears into the dark.I'm leaving Jimmy. I'm done.Ow. Tilda helps Jimmy up.Give Gary the time cube. You don't know him like I know him. He'll help us. He'll save us. Tilda is not convinced. Jimmy is on the soldering damaged circuits in a the control panel. He wears safety goggles. The Time Cube sits on the floor behind him.It's just a phase. Jimmy closes the console he's working on. Presses buttons. The room shifts to the left.It's over Anton. We're leaving.Gary loves me. He loves me in ways you couldn't understand.Gary! I have the Time Cube! Gary stays in the shadows, nearby. We can see him quiver and jiggle as he speaks, suggestions of a jaw moving, but lots of amorphous tentacles and bulging monstrous shapes.What?We don't need to do that Gary. We can just go.I don't see why-Give me a second Gary.Can you give me a second Gary?I don't like being bossed around. Anton nods in confirmation of this.Yup. Valentina swings high at Gary and catches him upside the head. He snarls and bashes her with a tentacle, knocking away the handlebar. She gives him a few punches, kick in the duck nuts. Gary knocks her down by the sandwich machine. Anton grabs a chair. A tentacle comes at Anton - it pulls him over by his neck, he drops the chair, and is thrown down by the hatch. Gary side steps quickly, looking around. He sees the Time Cube on the counter and sends a tentacle at it. Valentina stabs the tentacle with a plastic fork and it pulls back, spraying green blood and mucous in an unexpectedly heavy geyser over Valentina, Anton and the room. Valentina throws the time cube over the table to Anton, who catches it. Gary refocusses on Val and moves toward her. He bashes her with a tentacle sending her over the table. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 87.Thanks Tilda.He did it. The room stops shaking. The RUMBLE sound stops.You're twice the man Gary ever was.We're fine up here.
