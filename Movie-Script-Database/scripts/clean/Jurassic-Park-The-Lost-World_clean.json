I never said I was in any such place.Ian MalcolmNot really.Resentful.I didn't know you -- weren't well.They do have motives. Why did you want to see me? Your message said it was urgent.What?What are you talking about?I don't believe you.No, no, no, no, no, no . . .Are you out of your mind? I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?So what?John . . .I'm not going, John.Find someone else.Do me a favor. Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth. You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.You cost me my livelihood. That on which I relied to support my children.I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.It was a payoff and an insult. InGen never--Do you have a satellite phone?We leave in twenty-four hours. Five member team.Eddie Carr's handling all our equipment and he'll be there to maintain it. He's designing special field trailers now, top of the line mobile research units.Any damage?\"Minimal\" is too much. It has to be light, it has to be strong --You are an academic.You think I'm all talk, Eddie?Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all?Kelly! What are you doing here?Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour. You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right. You're going to have a fantastic time.I can't tell you. But I'll be back within a week.I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.Very hurtful. Your mother tell you to say that?Is that kid still bothering you?You know, at the bus stop. With the hair?Well, is he?That Richard.Out of the question. You'd miss the gymnastics trials. You've been training for that for a year.This is nothing like Austin. Forget about it.I'm not like you wan me to be. I've what I can be.Dr. Harding insisted we go by sea! Helicopters are too disruptive. These aren't piles of bones you'll be studying this time, Dr. Juttson, they live, they breathe, and they react!Be back in three days, but keep the satellite phone on and your radio tuned to the frequency I specified in case we need you sooner.Listen. I know you all have probably concluded that I'm out of my mind.Is there an antidote?She's nuts.That's a scientific impossibility, you know. Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Whatever you study, you also change.No way.A campfire?!Who the hell started a campfire?!Oh ... man.You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!You're going home. I'm sending a radio call for the boats. We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.I'm her father.You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.How could you possibly?Because I didn't know! I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.Where does it say that?No! We're an independently funded expedition.John Hammond.What are you doing to me, John?Ludlow. That's why Hammond was in such a hurry for me to get here. He knew they were coming.They want their money back. To InGen, this island is nothing more than a bed investment.I can't believe Peter Ludlow's running all this.Well, if that's true -- the man in charge just left camp.Our chance to do what?Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away. Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.HOLY SHIT!!So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!This is exceedingly unwise.Just do whatever you have to do and get it out of here as quickly as possible.Can you set up?Think fast, Sarah.Oh, Christ.What do you think they want?!Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?! GIVE IT TO THEM!Are you insane?!Wait there. I'll come up in a minute. Don't move, understand?No.All right. I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated. John Hammond will too. Do you have enough to publish?Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back. I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now. This expedition is over.What the hell is he sorry f-Oh, God.They're pushing us over the cliff.Nick! Grab the phone!WE'RE IN HERE! GET SOME ROPE!Eddie?Are you all right?! Anything broken?I'm fine... I'm fine...No. I'm quite certain you can't.We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me, I have some experience in this matter.Damn it.You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?A statistical phenomenon. Says everything in the world goes in streaks. It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets. Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad. Bad things cluster. They go to hell together.Just -- flawed. Very deeply flawed.So that others would know about this place?Because it exists.Yes. And people will live in the absence of truth.I don't care about my life. But if I'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger --But why?It's called self-testing. But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction. A uniquely human characteristic. In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase. Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-Maybe. Maybe not.You okay?There must be a game trail, some kind of path that goes down there.KELLY? KEEEEELLLY?!KELLY, UP HERE!I gotta get down there!Four, counting the one in the chamber.The jungle. It's always ready to return.No.I don't know.What's he got in there?You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?There it is!What?Birdshit?Kelly?! KELLY?!Where's Kelly?We can't stay in here!This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!For sixty seconds, maybe! Look at this! You could-I have to find Kelly!DAMN IT, BE SURE!!It's too wide!Something's wrong.SHE'S ALONE!!Kelly! KELLY!Come on!CLIMB!KELLY!Kelly! I'm coming!GO GO GO GO GOG GO!Thank you. Kelly, thank God. Thank God for you...Hello, Lex. Tim.I'm sorry about your grandfather.Why?I know, Lex. But even if we're the only ones who ever know, it'll still be true. You see, I've decided that if the world found out about what your grandfather created, it wouldn't be around for very long.That's the thing about reality.Do you feel the cold wind blowing on your face? That's real.Do you see the four of us, standing here together, alive?

I'm touched. Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch. You go.Just a little bit too much, I think.A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins. If it escapes. But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay. I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death. Maybe I just feel too close to it my--I can think of none greater.What do I have to do to pick a fight with you, bring your mother into it?Really?Sorry. We were saying?Ajay. Go on up to my ranch, take a look around the trophy room, and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me.Cancel that, Dieter.Carnivores hunt near stream beds. Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions. First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is. Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day. Second condition -- my fee. You can keep it. All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs. A male. Buck only. Why and how are my business. If you don't like either of those conditions, you're on your own. Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care. But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas. Okay?Good lad.Dieter. This is a round-up, not a war. Use your powers of persuasion.It certainly does.HEY!To collect my fee.Ajay.It's the rex nest.If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance. The truck --Offering a little incentive.My father's .600 Nitro Express. Made in 1904. Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant. 8700 foot pound striking force.Forty yards. Less, maybe. I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.Or a laser beam from a satellite?I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep. All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.Rex won't be any different. It'll come.What?What the hell you do that for?!You've broken its leg!What in God's -- !Last time I leave you in charge.Isn't it obvious?Do we have anyone up there?That's what you think.Back off, Dieter.None of that matters. Our communications equipment's been destroyed. If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --If we can't stay in the rex's territory, we have to move tonight.What is?Look, we have two choices. We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.That may be. But you weren't with me at the time.You all right?What's that?Feeling a bit blue, are we?Why did you come here?Why should they?It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?So the truth is more important to you than your life?She yours?Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived. And the second greatest predator must take him down.You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead. And they asked him, \"why did you go up there to die?\" And he said \"I didn't. I went up there to live.\"Tell you what. You can see whatever you want to, to me, but you will not spew any more nihilist rants at anyone else in the group. I'm fighting panic, and you push the wrong buttons. Understand?Another half hour.FIVE MINUTES BREAK!Break's over, move on!How long ago was this?Then he's dead. Nobody tells the little girl. Last thing we need is screaming hysterics.You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you. MOVE IT OUT!!Looks like the worker village is down in there, about a mile and a half northeast from the base of these cliffs.They'll have to rest before we look for it. Eat. Sleep. Two hours. Then we hit it.You hear something?Oh, no.ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!Get my weapon.FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, DON'T RUN!MALCOLM! OVER HERE!She's okay! They'll stay in there, she's okay!Elephant grass!How many rounds did you find for that weapon?Don't let it out of your hands again. Can the kid walk?Can the kid walk?We're going to find a path down into the interior of the island. Load up whatever you think you need, and I mean need. If you can't carry it indefinitely, don't bring it. We'll hit the worker village in a couple hours and be out of here before dawn.Piss.Keep moving.Where's the power and radio setup?Good.Tyrannosaur urine. I don't want anything to do with it, and neither does any other animal on this island. This building is now demarcated as the rex's territory. As long as you stay in that building, you'll all be safe until the helicopter comes.After the rex. I saw a fresh kill back in the valley with tyrannosaur tracks all around it. If I'm not back in time, don't wait for me.Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.Possible.Now's the perfect time. The animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food. Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry.We took to the rock.Wind shift.It's just fed. It won't attack unless it's threatened. Don't move.Let it go, Peter. The animal won.Give me a ladder!", "clean_line": "ajay cheap aftershave send christmas actually wear touched sit sit brings mombassa time plugged suppose funded old son bitch little bit think true hunter mind animal wins escapes weren escapes ajay ve decided spend bit time company death maybe feel close think greater pick fight bring mother sorry saying ajay ranch look trophy room tell kind quarry think possibly cancel dieter carnivores hunt near stream beds want set base camp eat people bar peter want run little camping trip conditions charge dieter job sign checks tell good job open case scotch good day second condition fee want exchange services right hunt tyrannosaurs male buck business like conditions ahead set camp right swamp middle rex nest care ve safaris rich dentists listen suicidal ideas okay good lad dieter round war use powers persuasion certainly hey collect fee ajay rex nest nest upwind comes ll know chance truck offering little incentive father nitro express karimojo bell gave took elephant foot pound striking force yards maybe assume ll slug brain case bring laser beam satellite saw bull elephant die charging jeep jeep startle bull calves saw lioness carry wounded prey half miles way den teach cubs finish kill rex won different ll come hell ve broken leg god time leave charge isn obvious think dieter matters communications equipment destroyed radio satellite phone trailers went cliff guessing look face stay rex territory tonight look choices hike lagoon sit days open heavily water source waiting boat arrive head village shelter help weren time right feeling bit blue come ll exit knowing won truth important life island exits greatest predator lived second greatest predator remember guy years ago forget climbed everest oxygen came dead asked die said went live tell want spew nihilist rants group fighting panic push wrong buttons understand half hour minutes break break long ago dead tells little girl thing need screaming hysterics like waiting looks like worker village mile half northeast base cliffs ll rest look eat sleep hours hit hear oh mind weapon christ sake run malcolm okay ll stay okay elephant grass rounds weapon let hands kid walk kid walk going path interior island load think need mean need carry indefinitely bring ll hit worker village couple hours dawn piss moving power radio setup good tyrannosaur urine want animal island building demarcated rex territory long stay building ll safe helicopter comes rex saw fresh kill valley tyrannosaur tracks time wait runs nature hole cave wait possible perfect time animal fed won stalk food predators hurt hungry took rock wind shift fed won attack threatened let peter animal won ladder"}}}
