{"Godfather-Part-II": {"KAY": {"raw_line": "Smile, Anthony. Smile.Mr. Corleone can't right now......but we'll get one with the ladies.Thank you.Do you think it'll show in the picture?I'm so happy you could come.A business meeting ran late...but he promised he wouldn't be long.This is our son Anthony Vito Corleone. Today he made his First Holy Communion.Anthony, Daddy's busy.I'm sorry, Michael. Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left. Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?Yes, Michael.Anthony! Anthony, where are you going?Anthony, you were talking to Mr. Pentangeli?Sleeping inside me.Yes, Michael, it does.It made me think of what you told me once. In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate. That was seven years ago.Michael? Why are the drapes open?Leave her alone! You're talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard.Yes.I'm going to the market.Whose orders are these?I'm supposed to stay in my house.I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.I'm going to see my parents.How long does this go on?Am I a prisoner?I'm not surprised to see you, Tom.I can't love a man like that; I can't live with him, I can't let him be father to my children. Look.He's not like a little boy... he doesn't talk to me; he doesn't want to play; he doesn't like other children, he doesn't like toys. It's as though he's waiting for the time he can take his Father's place. You know what he told me when he was four years old. He said he had killed his Grandfather...... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden. And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge. How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?What kind of a family is this... are we human beings? He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo. He heard Connie.That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom. It's not your best side.He's not the same as when I met him.What the hell does that mean? Come on, Tom, speak out straight once in your life. I know Michael can't, but you're not Sicilian, you can tell a woman the truth; you can treat her like an equal, a fellow human being.When is it finally over? I want it to be over before my baby is born.I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada. Also, the children - Michael, they're here.In a minute. They're outside with Esther. I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.I'm not going to stay long; I can't.I think it's too late for changes, Michael. I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.Tell me, Michael. What really happened with Pentangeli?I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?And that's all he had to do. Just show his face.You would have killed his brother?I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.Goodbye, Michael.Michael.Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless. You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?At this moment, I feel no love for you at all. I never thought that could happen, but it has.You haven't heard me.The baby I lost...It wasn't a miscarriage. And you with your cunning, couldn't you figure it out! It was an abortion; an abortion, like our marriage is an abortion, something unholy and evil. I don't want your son; I wouldn't bring another of your sons into this world. An abortion, Michael... it was a son, and I had it killed, but this must all end!And I know that now it's over; I knew it then, there would be no way you could ever forgive me, not with this Sicilian thing that goes back two thousand years.Anthony, kiss Mama goodbye.Anthony, say goodbye; your Mama loves you.Anthony, kiss me once.", "clean_line": "smile anthony smile mr corleone right ll ladies thank think ll picture happy come business meeting ran late promised wouldn long son anthony vito corleone today holy communion anthony daddy busy sorry michael senator geary mr mrs barrett wanted thank left won join mr ola yes michael anthony anthony going anthony talking mr pentangeli sleeping inside yes michael think told years corleone family completely legitimate seven years ago michael drapes open leave talking right frightened machine guns going backyard yes going market orders supposed stay house supposed children new england week going parents long prisoner surprised tom love man like live let father children look like little boy talk want play like children like toys waiting time father place know told years old said killed grandfather said shot grandfather gun died garden asked asked tom meant father shoot revenge year old boy learn word revenge kind family human beings knows father killed uncle carlo heard connie time ve seen lawyer tom best met hell mean come tom speak straight life know michael sicilian tell woman truth treat like equal fellow human finally want baby born wanted went nevada children michael minute outside esther happy suppose knew simply smart beat going stay long think late changes michael promised wouldn talk ve gone spoiled tell michael happened pentangeli know brother face killed brother ll bring children want goodbye goodbye michael michael oh feel things michael think pity time ve known helpless held prisoner try moment feel love thought happen haven heard baby lost wasn miscarriage cunning couldn figure abortion abortion like marriage abortion unholy evil want son wouldn bring sons world abortion michael son killed end know knew way forgive sicilian thing goes thousand years anthony kiss mama goodbye anthony goodbye mama loves anthony kiss"}, "FREDO": {"raw_line": "Honey!

All those girls look like they're on stilts!Jeeze, it's great you came along, Mike... You know, we've never spent a night out on the town together. I always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time.Mike said let him gamble.Mike, I got something special up my sleeve for these boys. You ever hear of \"Superman?\" And I don't mean the comic book.Wait'll you see!Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels? I loved that ole sonuvabitch. I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids. We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts. An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember?You? What do you mean you, I thought...You? What do you mean you, I thought...No. I mean, are you sure?Me? NO, no, I don't know anything. Fellas! You're all falling asleep. We got to see Superman.What's eating him?Everyone stands. But it's worth it, watch!That's him; that's Superman!That's why they call him Superman. Johnny Ola told me about this; I didn't believe it.... but seeing is believing.

Sometimes I think... I think - I should a married someone, like you did. To have kids, to have a family.What's that?Sincere. What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother....Who?But, you told me yourself...What do you want me to do?What is it? Can I help?Nowhere, Mike. I wanted to get a refill. How about you?I don't have a lot to say, Michael.I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.I know they get Pentangeli, that's all I know.I didn't know it was a hit. I swear to you I didn't know. Johnny Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills -- said he wanted to talk. He said you and Roth were in on some big deal, and there was a place for me in it if I could help them out. They said you were being tough on the negotiation, and if they had a little bit of help, they could close it fast and it would be good for you.He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.Taken care of me. Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my. Did you ever think of that. Ever once? Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.

I went out on a fishing trip; me and my brothers and my Pop, and no one could catch a fish except me. And this was my secret: Every time I would put the line down I would say a \"Hail Mary\" and every time I said a \"Hail Mary\" I would catch a fish. Now, when it's sunset, we're gonna go out on the lake, and we're gonna try it.Here we go; and remember the secret.He's here; we're goin' fishing.Ah.

C'mon, give us a tarantella.Michael, in all respect, I didn't come three thousand miles for dinner.When do we talk?Yeah, the kid and me talked Sicilian. A one-way conversation!Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him.Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you. But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move? You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.Says who?Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.The Rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the Jew in Miami.How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods. And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last. Let me run my family without you on my back. I want them taken care of.You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.He did business...but he never trusted him.Rosato, where's your brother?He don't want to talk?Are we going to eat or what?Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite. You're making big trouble, Carmine.We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.Don't I look like I'm listening?I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something. Joe. Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash. And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?What if I say shove it?You want a war?You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me. That puts me and the other New York families against you.I'm talking about Italians!He supports me.You drove old Pete Clemenza to his grave, Carmine; you and your brother. Turning on him; trouble in his territories -- you and your demands. I hold you responsible, just as though you shot him in the head. And I ain't gonna let that go for long!Nobody I hate calls me Five-Angels to my face!What's up?What's this?One Michael Corleone...Dove?Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming. We could have prepared something for you.Michael, yes, we was all relieved...Michael, anything. What is it I can do for you?I was just going to contact you, Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, I just come from there.Mike, I don't understand. Don't ask me to do that.It would be the beginning of the end for my family. How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?Always... But sometimes I don't understand. I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.Then why do you want me to lay down to them?Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.Sure, Mike. I'll go along.Wait in the car.What's this?I don't like the C-note. I take it like an insult.The bastard. The dirty bastard, he gave me a C-note. He gave me a C- note.Ten to one shot, you said. Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.Yeah, some deal I made.Some deal.

I never heard of nothing like that. I was in the olive oil business with his father a long time ago. That's all.The FBI guys promised me a deal. So I made up a lot of stuff about Michael Corleone. Because then, that's what they wanted. But it was all lies. Everything. They said Michael Corleone did this, Michael Corleone did that. So I said, \"Yeah, sure.\"The room has a bug in it.Did my brother go back?He's ten times tougher than me, my brother. He's old-fashioned.That's my brother. Nothing could get him away from that two mule town. He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family.Tom, what do I do now?Yeah, I still read a lot. They bring me stuff.Yeah, it worked. Those were great old days. We was like the Roman Empire. The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.Yeah, but only the rich guys. The little guys got knocked off. If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.They went home and sat in a hot bath and opened their veins, and bled to death.

What are you studying in college?How will Fine Arts support your new wife?Never be embarrassed by your wealth. This recent contempt for money is still another trick of the rich to keep the poor without it. Of course I give you my blessing. Let's set the wedding soon...it will be my pleasure to give the bride away....and take a few courses in Business Administration just to be on the safe side!Make her dowry impressive. He comes from a family who still thinks an Italian bride goes barefoot.It's him. Fabrizzio. Revenge is a dish that tastes best when it's cold.Later. Tom?Two-thirty. That gives me time to see my boy.All right. Apologize to Pentangeli.I said I would see my sister, alone.I saw him with you.Why do you come to me? Why don't you go to a travel agent?The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.Then why do you come to me?Connie, I want to be reasonable with you. You have a house here, with us. You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything. I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on. Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand. But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.Are you finished?Then out.Rocco, his friends must be hungry. See what you can do, but I'd like to keep them away from the guests.You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola.Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny. He only handles specific areas of the family business. Tom?Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.How is his health?Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated. I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.This is my boy, and my wife. Mr. John Ola of Miami.Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay. Please tell the Senator I won't be a minute.Kay.Find Hagen.It was very kind of you to come to my home on this occasion, Senator. My wife has been very concerned with making a good impression on the people who are our neighbors, and your appearance here has made her very happy. If I can ever perform a service for you, you only have to ask.My lawyer, Tom Hagen. He arranged this all through your man Turnbull.I trust these men with my life. They are my right arms; I cannot insult them by sending them away.Turnbull is a good man.Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state. I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here. The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator. But never think it applies to my family.Senator... ...you can have my answer now if you'd like.My offer is this. Nothing...not even the thousand dollars for the Gaming Commission, which I'd appreciate if you would put up personally.It's all right, Tom, we'll talk later. Tell Frankie Pentangeli I'd like him to have dinner at my family table before we do business.I know.After dinner.We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.You were unfair with them.Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.They feel cheated.Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.I know. That's why I want you to be fair with them.No. There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth. I don't want them disturbed.Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.The old man had too much vino rosso, or he'd never talk openly that way. Let him go back to New York; I've already made my plans. It's late; I've spent so little time at the party.Forget it, just go take care of her.How's the baby?Does it feel like a boy?I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today. It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.Can't you sleep?Are you alright?Did you like your party?Do you like them?They were friends.No, where is it?I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.Just a few days.I can't.To do business.Some day you will.Go with the kids.Keep them alive.It's important.It will be all right. We were lucky.And?Fredo, can't you shut that woman up! Get her in here!Have Tom Hagen meet me in the Harbor House.Sit down, Tom.There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom. I know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence. But it is because I do trust you that I've kept so much secret from you. It's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that I can completely trust. In time, you'll understand everything.No, I have confidence in their loyalty... but this is life and death, and Tom, you are my brother.No Tom, just listen. All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that. One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all. I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him. What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me. And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary. I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone. I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent....But Tom, you must know that I do this only because I believe you are the only one who is capable of taking over for me.I've prepared this; have had it for over a month. It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life. Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately. Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him. It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult. The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.I don't think so. Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.If I'm wrong......I don't think I'm wrong. Yes.Fish them out.Yes.Put it right there.Thank you.You'll wait in the car.Thank you, Mrs. Roth.Fine.Not for a few years.Yes.The incident of the other night is a nuisance that I can take care of. I came to you because I want nothing to affect our agreement; I wanted to clear everything I'm going to do with you, just in case.You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.Technically, they are still under the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family, now run by Frankie Pentangeli. After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own. Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them. I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down. Pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. I was lucky and he was stupid. I'll visit him soon. The important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans, yours and mine. This thing of ours, that we will build.Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?Then it's done. I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.I didn't want you to know I was coming. You heard what happened in my home?In my home! In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.I want you to help me take my revenge.I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.I want you to settle on their terms.Trust me; do as I ask.Frankie...do you respect me? Do I have your loyalty?I know.Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed. I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here. I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you. My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things. Never. If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound. I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow. We have friends in some very important business that we're making. Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms. Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me. It will get back to Hyman Roth. Do this, Frankie. You can trust me.Good.No, I'm fine.Very impressive.I was told the Cubans now call this drink: \"La Mentira.\"It means... \"The Lie.\"I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla. Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him.It occurred to me: the police are paid to fight, and the Rebels are not.So, that occurred to me.We're making a big investment in Cuba. That's my only concern.The money was sent.I wouldn't consider anyone else.You'll be there to see it; you'll be there.Thank you. Tom? Tom, is that you?Mio fratello.It's all right. He stays with me all the time.We're making an investment in Havana.Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.Pentangeli's dead. He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers. Didn't you know that?I want you to help me, Fredo.Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.I'd like to come along. There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.This doubles my investment.Six million dollars in cash is a high price for a piece of a country in the middle of a revolution.I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well. As a heavy investor, I'm pleased. How did the doctor find you?Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?I know that; but who gave the go ahead.I know it wasn't me...so that leaves you.How sick do you think the old man is?I never looked down on you, Fredo. You don't look down at a brother.Let him gamble.No.It was hard to have him killed.It was hard to have him killed.It was Frankie tried to have me hit.You know otherwise, Freddie?How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?\"Yo soy un hombre sincero...\" I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...The song. Are you sincere with me, Fredo?Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent. They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President. When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women. I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that. It was Roth all along. He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing. I've already made my move.The old man will never bring in the New Year.Fredo. Where are you going?I've arranged for a plane; we're going to Miami in an hour. Try not to make a big thing of it.I know it was you, Fredo. You've broken my heart.Come with me. It's your only way of getting out!He isn't here.All right. Go now.Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?Al, get me a wet towel. Does Kay know I'm back?Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?What was it, so I'll know.Fellas, can you wait outside a minute?Where's my brother?I asked about Fredo?I want you to reach Fredo. I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him. Assure him that there will be no reprisals. Tell him that I know Roth misled him.They can come in now.Alright.Go on, tell me.Was it a boy or a girl?What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!And Kay...she's all right?Does she blame it on me? The baby?Mom... Mom...It's Michael. How are you, Mom?There are still things I have to do.Alright. They bother me once in awhile. Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?No, I meant lose his family.But times are different...Yes.It was not an alias. GODFATHER was a term of affection, used by his friends, one of respect.No.I deny his every charge.That is a complete falsehood.That is not true. I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts. I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock.Senator, I've observed the head of General Motors before a Senate Committee, and his lawyer whispered in his ear. That was not commented upon in the way you have just done.I do not.I do not.In the hopes of clearing my family name, in the sincere desire to give my children their fair share of the American way of life without a blemish on their name and background I have appeared before this committee and given it all the cooperation in my power. I consider my being called before this committee an act of prejudice to all Americans of Italian extraction. I consider it a great dishonor to me personally to have to deny that I am a criminal. I wish to have the following noted for the record. That I served my country faithfully and honorably in World War II and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for actions in defense of my country. That I have never been arrested or indicted for any crime whatsoever... that no proof linking me to any criminal conspiracy, whether it is called Mafia or Cosa Nostra or whatever other name you wish to give, has ever been made public. Only one man has made charges against me, and that man is known to be a murderer, arsonist and rapist. And yet this committee had used this person to besmirch my name. My personal protest can only be made to the people of this country. I can only thank God that in this country we have a legal system and courts of law to protect innocent people from wild accusation. I thank God for our democratic due process of Law that shields me from the false charges made by this committee's witness. I have not taken refuge behind the Fifth Amendment, though counsel advised me to do so. I challenge this committee to produce any witness or evidence against me, and if they do not, I hope they will have the decency to clear my name with the same publicity with which they have now besmirched it. I ask this without malice, in the interests of fair play.How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?What does Fredo know?Alright. I'm going to go outside and talk to Fredo.We have time.What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?And you believed that story.I've always taken care of you.It's the way Pop wanted it.There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?You're nothing to me now, Fredo; not a brother, not a friend, I don't want to know you, or what happens to you. I don't want to see you at the hotels, or near my home. When you visit our Mother, I want to know a day in advance, so I won't be there. Do you understand?I don't want anything to happen to him while my Mother's alive.On the phone?I had no idea...Where?Why don't you sit down?There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about. Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.Why too late?His brother came to help him.On a plane back to Sicily.That's all. You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one. IF he was a traitor.Kay, you've got it wrong. That kind of thing's all over, I promised you. This was between the two brothers. Years ago Frankie had a young girlfriend; he called her his co-wife. That was his joke, but he meant it. He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook. He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her. He set her up in a house in Jersey. She had to be faithful... and she had to have kids. And she did, two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat... but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life. She begged him to let her go. He did. He gave her money and made her give up the kids. Then Frankie took them to Italy, and had them brought up by his brother Vincenzo. Where he knew they'd by safe.When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake. I don't think Vincenzo would have done it. He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay. Honor, silence. It had nothing to do with me. It was between those brothers.Kay, I told you...I won't let you leave! Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years. You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.We'll go back tonight. Bring the children.How can I let you leave; how can I let you take my children away? Don't you know me? You understand, it's an impossibility. I would never let it happen; no, never, not if it took all my strength, all my cunning. But in time, soon, you'll feel differently. You see, you'll be happy that I stopped you. I know you. You'll forget about this; you'll forget about the baby we lost... and we'll go on, you and I.I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you. I will make changes; I can. I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.You won't take my children.No.Tom is right.The children can stay.Sit down, Tom. Have you heard about our friend and partner, Mr. Hyman Roth?They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.I want it met.I don't like it when you use the word impossible; nothing is impossible...I'm surprised at you, Tom. If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill... ANYBODY. But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there. Or weren't you going to tell me at all?They are everywhere!I know you do, Tom. Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do. If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.Good. Then you're staying.Anthony.You've grown so tall... so tall in the last year. You're much taller than me.Sit down. Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.Well, that's alright... alright. Good. You'll graduate in another year, isn't that right? You know... I never finished college. I was a good student, but I never finished. Of course, there was a war then.Hurry back; we'll talk. We'll talk.Pop, I've decided I'm going to enlist.I never asked for it; I don't want it.No, Dad.It's not talk; I'm doing it.Not for strangers; for my country.That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily.I won't be a man like you.", "clean_line": "sit francie let speak francesca oldest brother daughter died years ago ve felt father uncle love pleased impressed thought come going

Turnbull. Turnbull's a heavy gambler, and into us for over a hundred grand, so I figure his information is reliable.The Senator can be set up; but he thinks of himself as a clean politician. So it's got to be on terms he can live with: campaign contribution, donation to a charitable cause that he controls, things like that. If he gets even the inkling that you think you're buying him, he'll freeze up. Nevada's a funny state, they like things both ways here... All right. Turnbull says the Senator will be here at two-thirty, and he's been primed. He knows you'll want to meet with him alone, and he knows it's about the Tropicana's license. At any rate, he expects to be introduced around to some of the influential people here today, and generally treated as an ordinary guest. Just go light on him, Mikey, sometimes the biggest crooks don't like to think of themselves as crooks...I'm sorry; of course, you know that.Connie's outside.I promised; she said it was urgent.Sure, Mikey.If you need anything, just...Where's my wife?He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.I can feel it in the way he talks to me.Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact. I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him. But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider.It's as though he blames me for the ground the family lost when I was Consigliere to Sonny.I love Michael, I want to help him, be close to him. I don't want to end up a third string lawyer making property settlements for the hotels.But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...Mikey, I hoped...Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?But if you're wrong...Get rid of the bodies. Tomorrow morning I want a report made to the local police, and paper, that some explosives we keep on the property were accidentally ignited.Actually, I've come with good news; the Corleone family has done you a favor.We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did. No strings.You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.Do you gamble?Do you owe markers?The Corleone family has paid them off for you...as an expression of our esteem.Our mistake. But what does it matter; it was our money. We don't even expect thanks.We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.Simple. Be friendly like us. Not hostile.Kay.I wanted to explain this myself... I had business in Carson City.It's Michael's request...for your safety. We can send out for anything you need.Within the compound will be fine.That's off now.Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat. But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.I don't know. I'm sorry, Kay...That's not the way we look at it.Twenty-five this time.Mike wants it.Your plans are a little different this time. You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva. It's to be deposited to this number. And it's got to be there by Monday morning, no slip-up.Let them count.No questions.Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.You've been through a lot with us so I'm going to give you the truth. Mike knows it was someone within the compound that set him up for that hit. So nobody is to know where he is, not you, not Rocco, not even his brother Fredo. Sorry, Al, I know how you feel about Mike...but he still remembers Tessio.Just a little.What about Kay?Let me try Kay.Kay?Anyone hungry?Hello?What do you mean gone?Why didn't someone tell me!Rocco!Goddamn it, where were you?Get me a Scotch and water.I can't let him down.All right, let me think a minute.Yeah, give me a minute.Oh Christ, Pop. It was so good when you were alive. I felt I could handle anything...Kay... Kay...You don't know that's true. But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.Okay, just hear me out. What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed? What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what? And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband? What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow. You'd have no problem.If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man.I don't know. I hope soon; but it's not over yet, and that's why you and the kids have to come back to me.No. But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.Michael, take the Fifth all the way, that way you can't get into trouble.I took care of it.A little care he can ride in with an electric motor.Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami. Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam. The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping. Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.Wait... there's something else.Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.Mike, at three and a half...It was a boy.She took the Senate Investigation worse.I don't know.Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity. He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.Roth engineered it, Michael. He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive. Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI. My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him. Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.He says he doesn't know anything, and I believe him. Roth played this one beautifully.Yes, sir. His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.He is, I believe, a brother.Sir, the gentleman does not understand English. He would not in any case, take the stand. He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble. He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.Senator Kane.This committee owes an apology!He's waiting for you to leave.No chance. I'm sorry, Freddie.He's in the boathouse.Yes.I don't know.I know he's in Israel.He's going to try Panama...His medical condition is reported as... \"terminal.\"That plane goes to Miami...Mike, it's impossible. He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.Mike, it would be like trying to kill the President; there's no way we can get to him.Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down. Are you sure, Mikey? Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've always been loyal to you.I'm staying. Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this; Sonny never listened to me about that. Now, explain everything to me.I think I prefer to see my client privately.I'd like to go outside with him, in the open air.You have guards outside and the electric fence. There's no security reason for not letting us talk in the yard.Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry.Yeah, but don't worry.Yeah. He wouldn't even go out to dinner. Just wanted to go home.You're right.Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history. I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43. We were young then.You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.Yeah, it was once.The Roman Empire... when a plot against the Emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.Yeah, that was a good break. A nice deal.Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.Wonderful, Sal.Well, we could have expected it after the embargo.Pop had to pull a lot of strings to get you your deferment.", "clean_line": "ve cleared senator chief aide man named turnbull turnbull heavy gambler grand figure information reliable senator set thinks clean politician got terms live campaign contribution donation charitable cause controls things like gets inkling think buying ll freeze nevada funny state like things ways right turnbull says senator thirty primed knows ll want meet knows tropicana license rate expects introduced influential people today generally treated ordinary guest light mikey biggest crooks like think crooks sorry course know connie outside promised said urgent sure mikey need wife want help need feel way talks johnny ola showed asked leave ola hyman roth sicilian contact inside meetings today mike asked leave like outsider blames ground family lost consigliere sonny love michael want help close want end string lawyer making property settlements hotels people neri rocco think mikey hoped able ordered wrong rid bodies tomorrow morning want report local police paper explosives property accidentally ignited actually ve come good news corleone family favor know busy man plenty enemies saw opportunity favor strings know senate investigating committee recently set thought unfortunate trace provoking gamble owe markers corleone family paid expression esteem mistake matter money expect thanks ll quiet people know trustworthy committee needn simple friendly like hostile kay wanted explain business carson city michael request safety send need compound fine kay michael tell lot tell repeat responsibility kids important thing left know sorry kay way look time mike wants plans little different time skip miami straight geneva deposited number got monday morning slip let count questions al far concerned ve lot going truth mike knows compound set hit know rocco brother fredo sorry al know feel mike remembers tessio little kay let try kay kay hungry hello mean gone tell rocco goddamn scotch water let right let think minute yeah minute oh christ pop good alive felt handle kay kay know true kay sake argument let assume saying remember gave justification possible justification possibly okay hear carlo paid help sonny killed beating connie time deliberate plot sonny open great man couldn bring avenge son death killing daughter husband finally michael successor knowing michael load shoulders guilt dead widow problem told michael ve told today dead man know hope soon kids come somebody ll years perjury wrong middle michael fifth way way trouble took care little care ride electric motor roth got private boat hospital miami stroke recovered okay bussetta dead new government arrested held couple days lot casino people including roth brother sam american embassy arranged flights citizens sure think new york information fredo thought kidnapping roth assured happen wait kay miscarriage lost baby mike half boy took senate investigation worse know senator client like read statement record sir client answered question asked committee utmost cooperation sincerity taken fifth amendment right extreme legal complexity hearing counsel advised think fairness committee hear statement record roth engineered michael pentangeli think hit deliberately letting alive new york detectives turned frankie fbi informants half dead scared stiff talking loud turned tried kill possession dealing heroin murder lot way ve opened points perjury says know believe roth played beautifully yes sir vincenzo pentangeli believe brother sir gentleman understand english case stand came expense aid brother trouble jurisdiction government reputation country impeccable senator kane committee owes apology waiting leave chance sorry freddie boathouse yes know know israel going try panama medical condition reported terminal plane goes miami mike impossible ll met internal revenue customs service half fbi mike like trying kill president way hungry traitors want turned houstan tell offer turned sure mikey sure ll gain family gain forget mike know answer hurt michael ve loyal staying enjoy cruel sonny listened explain think prefer client privately like outside open air guards outside electric fence security reason letting talk yard going okay frankie worry yeah worry yeah wouldn dinner wanted home right frankie interested politics history remember talking hitler young old timers dreamed families organized based old roman legions called regimes capos soldiers worked yeah roman empire plot emperor failed plotters given chance let families fortunes yeah good break nice deal worry frankie angels wonderful sal expected embargo pop pull lot strings deferment"}}}
