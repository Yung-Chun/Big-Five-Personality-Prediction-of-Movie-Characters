{"Wonder-Woman": {"DIANA": {"raw_line": "I used to want to save the world...This beautiful place.But the closer you get, the more you see the great darkness simmering within.And mankind? That's another story altogether.What one does faced with the truth, is more difficult than you think.I learned this the hard way. A long, long time ago. And now I will never be the same.I'm sorry --You are a... man?You are on Themyscira.Who are you?Germans?Antiope!No! Please no!Go where? Antiope! No!Mother, no! He fought at my side against the invaders.The Lasso of Hestia compels you to reveal the truth.War? What war?Mother -- ?Excuse me, Mother. But after everything the man said... this must be Ares.Forgive me, Senator Acantha, but... the man called it a war without end. Millions of people already dead. Like nothing he's ever seen. Only Ares could do such a thing. We cannot simply let him go. We must go with him.It is not their war. Zeus created man to be just and wise, strong and passionate.But Ares is behind that corruption. It is Ares who has these Germans fighting. And stopping the God of War is our foreordinance --Themyscira has seen death for the first time, Mother. Ares must not be allowed to threaten us again. We know only too well what happens if he finds us -- and he will. Never again shall we be enslaved. And now mankind must be freed. As Amazons this is our duty!You may be afraid to face Ares, Mother, but I am not.Who told you that?Would you say you're a typical example of your sex?What is that?A watch.Why?You let this little thing tell you what to do?Themyscira.We speak hundreds of languages. We are the bridge to a greater understanding between all men.Thank you for what you did on the beach.I'm sorry... It's not up to me. I tried. I even asked them to send me with you ---- or anyone. An Amazon. The Amazons.It is our sacred duty to defend the world... and I wish to go. But my mother will not allow it.Then why do you want to go back?Thank you. Now I will show you the way off the island. And you will take me to Ares.We are.Do you not know how to sail?Then there's nothing to be afraid of.What?I can't stand by while innocent lives are lost. If no one else will defend the world from Ares, I must. I have to go --I understand enough. That I'm willing to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves. Like you once did...I will.How long until we reach the war?Where the fighting is the most intense then. If you take me there, I am sure I will find who I'm looking for.Ares.The God of War is our responsibility. Only an Amazon can defeat him. With this.And once I do, the war will end.You're looking at the person who can. And after I find and destroy Ares, the German armies will be freed from his influence -- and they will be good men again.The world of men? I know all there is to know about them -- from the great books.I was raised on the island.My mother sculpted me from clay. I was brought to life by Zeus.You refer to reproductive biology.Ah. The pleasures of the flesh.Of course. I've read all twelve volumes of Clio's Treatises on Bodily Pleasure.You would not enjoy them. They came to the conclusion that men are essential for procreation, but when it comes to pleasure... unnecessary.It's hideous.Why are they holding hands?Because this is the way to the war?Then where are we going?I let you go, you take me to Ares. We made a deal, Steve Trevor. A deal is a promise. A promise is unbreakable.What are you doing?Why?What do these women wear into battle?A baby.What is a secretary?Where I'm from, that's called slavery.Is this what passes for armor in your country?Why must you keep them in?How can a woman possibly fight in this?So itchy. And it's choking me.Why is everyone staring? Is it because I can barely breathe in this?Thank you.Please. Protect it with your life.What is it?I am sorry. You are clearly under his control. Let me help you get free. Tell me where he is... Where will I find Ares?He's dead.Why will they not let him speak? He's talking peace.But if they want to stop the war, isn't that foolish? Are they fools?Diana, Princess of --Ottoman and Sumerian.Surely someone else in this room knew that.Thank you. It's a formula... for a new kind of mustard...Mustard gas. Hydrogen-based, instead of sulfur.The book says they plan to release this gas at... the front... Front of what?I don't.It's not confusing. It's unthinkable.I am not with you. You would knowingly sacrifice all those lives? Do they mean less than yours? Where I come from Generals don't hide in their offices like cowards. They fight alongside their soldiers. They die with them on the battlefield.You should be ashamed! All of you.That's your leader? How could he say that? Believe that? And YOU! Was your duty to simply give them a book? You didn't stand your ground! You didn't fight!This is Ares and he isn't going to allow a negotiation or a surrender. The millions of people you talked about? They will die. My people? They're next!What? You mean you were lying?How do I know you're not lying to me right now?You have no faith in yourself.These are the reinforcements? Are these even good men?Relative to what?Sammy. Please.[He doesn't look that impressive to me?][And your eyes look like they want something.][But can you recite Socrates in Ancient Greek?]At least this Charlie is good with his fists.What were you fighting about?This man is no fighter.How do you know who you kill if you can't see their face?My aunt warned me about men like you.You fight without honor.[You won't need a picture. I'm coming with you.]Sir Patrick!The gas, Ludendorff, Maru... You realize they are all symptoms. Ares is the disease. And once I find him, none of this will matter.You won't need to. I'll know him when I see him.It's cold.It's wonderful. You should be very proud.Chief?A liar, a murderer, and now a smuggler?I wasn't referring to you.The gas will kill everyone... everything.What kind of weapon kills innocents?I am Diana.I plucked him from the sea --Strange thunder.So... who do you fight for in this war?You're here for profit then?Nowhere better to be than a war you don't take a side in?Who took that from your people? Chief cocks his head to the side. How could she not know?You're safe. What did you see?No, I'm --Those animals. Why are they hurting them?But I can help them!That man... He's injured.Where are we?But where are Ares' men -- the Germans?[Where did this happen?]We need to help these people.But these people are dying, they've nothing to eat. And in the village... Enslaved, she said. Women. Children.How can you say that? What is the matter with you?So we do nothing?No, but it's what I'm going to do.We're not finished yet.Stay here. I'll go ahead.Is there a way inside?!It's too high.For all his talk of murdering people from afar, your shooter can't shoot.He doesn't charge them?You shouldn't be worried about upsetting the peace accord. Ares would never let that happen...Of course... It makes complete sense. Ares developed a weapon, the worst ever devised.No. I mean Ares. Ludendorff is Ares.It's bitter.We did.Dance on Themyscira is more --Precisely. Perhaps you'd better show me.If I'm going to a gala, I'll need to know how to --Of course, I am. Why wouldn't I?I would argue that they don't know how to dance.You're awfully close.Ah. I see.It's magical.Is this what people do when there are no wars to fight?What things?What else?What is it like?Maybe... once I defeat Ares and war ends forever... there will be time to learn about... all kinds of things.You are.If you're coming, Charlie, perhaps you'll sing more for us. I enjoyed it very much.I could get in.Dangerous?I can be stealthy.But as long as he's still alive --That was... fun.I confess, I'm not sure what we're celebrating.Victory? When I hear peace is so close?Thucydides.Only one of the many gods believed in that... and he was wrong.What are you doing?You agree to do things all the time then don't do them. Let me go --It won't matter --You don't believe me.What I do isn't up to you.The village.No. Oh, no, no, no.They're dead. They're all dead. YOU DID THIS!You stopped me from killing Ares when I had the chance. You murderer! You killed these people!STAY AWAY FROM ME!Everything you've said to me is a lie. But I see the truth now. It isn't just the Germans that Ares has corrupted. It's you, too. It's all of you.I will find Ares and I will kill him.You know why I'm here. I am Diana of Themyscira, daughter of Hippolyta.We'll see about that.I, daughter of Hippolyta, came here to complete the mission of the Amazons by taking your life, and ridding mankind and my people of you -- forever!I killed him. I killed Ares but nothing stopped. You kill the God of War, you stop the war.No! Steve. All of this should have stopped. The fighting. It should have stopped. So why are they doing this?!You knew what?!But Ares is dead. They don't have to do this anymore. So why would they?!No... It can't be... Everything I saw? They were killing each other. Killing people they can't even see... Killing children. Like it was nothing... It had to be him!! It can't be them!My mother was right. She said `the world of men don't deserve you.' That's why she left. They don't deserve our help.Steve?Who's there? What are you doing?Sir Patrick?You're him. You.I am Diana of Themyscira, daughter of Hippolyta... and I am here to complete her mission --The Godkiller...I --You lie!I compel you to tell me the truth!No... No, I'd never be a part of that.What?Steve!Steve...Steve...NO!!!!What are you saying? Steve, whatever it is, I can do it. Let me do it --What?You're wrong about them...They're everything you say, but so much more.It's not about deserve...It's about what you believe... and I believe in love --Good-bye, brother.Steve did that.I don't think so.Where did you read that?I used to want to save the world.To end war and bring peace to mankind.But now I've touched the darkness that lives in between the light. Seen the terrible things men do to each other in the name of hatred... and the lengths they'll go to for love. And now I know that only love can truly save the world.

The only child on the island. Please, let her be so.There will be no training.It's time to sleep.Fighting doesn't make you a hero.Diana... You are the most precious thing in this world to me. So much so, I sculpted you from clay and begged Zeus to give you life.Then I will tell you a new one. One of our people, and my days of battle...So you will finally understand... why war is nothing to hope for.Long ago, when time was new, and all of history was still a dream... the gods ruled the Earth, Zeus king among them.Zeus created beings over which the gods would rule -- beings born in his image -- fair and good, strong and passionate. Zeus called his creation... man. And mankind was good. Another flash of lightning REVEALS MANKIND.But one grew envious of Zeus' love for mankind -- and sought to corrupt his creation.This was Ares. The God of War. The sky splits open and fire rains from the heavens. Men take up arms, falling in line around Ares and becoming his ARMY.Ares poisoned men's hearts with jealousy and suspicion, vengeance and rage. He turned them against one another.And war ravaged the Earth.So the gods made us, the Amazons, to influence men's hearts with love and to restore peace to the world.For a brief time, there was peace, even a unity among the world, as the gods and man fought side-by- side against a great evil.While Zeus used the last of his power to stop Ares...... striking him such a blow, the God of War was forced to retreat.With Zeus' dying breath, he created this island to shield us from the outside world. Somewhere Ares could not find us.We give thanks to the gods for this paradise.The Godkiller?This is where we keep all the gifts the gods have given us.I pray there will never come a time when it is called to arms. But only the fiercest among us even could... And that is not you, Diana. She takes Diana's hand away from the sword.So you see, my daughter, you are safe. And it is nothing for you to concern yourself with.Diana!Training. It seems I am not the revered queen I should be. Disobeyed, betrayed, by my own sister --Take her to the palace.You speak of a time that may never come. He may never return! He could have died of his wounds.The stronger Diana gets --She is to never know the truth about what she is and how she came to be. You will train her harder than every Amazon before her.Five times harder -- ten times harder. You will train her until she is unconquerable.Get up, Diana.What have you done?Diana!Step away from her! NOW!Sister!You!What is your mission?What is your mission?Take him to the infirmary.And risk him bringing more men to our shores. Phillipus...We are not deploying our army and leaving Themyscira defenseless to go and fight their war!That was a story, Diana. There is much you do not know. Mankind is easily corruptible.We must care to our wounded, honor our fallen!You are not an Amazon like the rest of us, Diana.You don't know war like we do.Afraid? You know nothing of fear, child. Nothing of war. Nothing of pain. Nothing of sacrifice. So you will do nothing. Your Queen forbids it.I know.Or at least I know that I cannot stop you. There is so much... so much you do not understand.You know that if you choose to leave us, you may never return. Once you leave this island, its location will fade from your memory...This belonged to the greatest warrior in our history -- make sure you are worthy of it.Be careful in the world of men, Diana, they do not deserve you.You have been my greatest love.

That's all I'm at liberty to s--Seconded... to British Intelligence. What the hell is this thing, anyway?Whoever you are, you're in enough danger as it is. You shouldn't --I'm a spy.British Intelligence got word that the leader of the German Army, General Ludendorff, was visiting a secret military installation in the Ottoman Empire.I posed as one of their pilots, then flew in with them.According to our intel, the Germans had no troops left, no money, no munitions of any kind...... but our intel was wrong. The Germans had the Turks making bombs for them. And not just bombs...New weapons. Invented by Ludendorff's chief psychopath. Dr. Isabel Maru.Boys in the trenches call her `Dr. Poison.'From what I saw... if Dr. Maru was able to complete her work, millions would die. The war would never end. I had to do something...Dammit.I was on my way back to London when the Germans shot me down...But if I can get those notes to British Intelligence in time, it might make a difference... ... stop millions more from dying... Stop the war...... The War to End All Wars. Four years, twenty-seven nations, twenty-five million dead -- soldiers... and civilians...... Innocent people. Women and children. Slaughtered. Their homes -- villages -- looted, burned. Weapons deadlier, more horrifying than you can imagine. Like nothing I've ever seen... It's like... ... like the world is going to end.Didn't hear you come in./Didn't hear you knock.I like to think of myself as... above average.It's a watch.My father gave it to me. Been through hell and back with him, and now me, and it's still ticking.Because it tells time. So, I know when to wake up, work, eat, sleep.Do you mind if I ask you a couple hundred questions?What is this place?I caught that before. I mean what is this place? How come I've never heard of it? Who the hell are you people? How do you know English?Funny, because I understand even less now than before you walked in.Hey, I didn't get to say it earlier... but thanks for dragging me out of the water.So... Are you here to let me go?The Amazons?Can't say I blame her. The way this war is going, I wouldn't let anyone I care about near it.I don't think want is the word, but... I've gotta try. My father used to say.`You see something wrong in the world, you can either do nothing, or you can do something. And you already tried nothing.'Nice outfit.Deal.I'm leaving in that?We're leaving in that?Of course, I know how to sail. Why wouldn't I be able to sail? Just haven't since I was a kid -- She nods, motions to the boat with encouragement.The war? Well, which part? The Eastern Front in France is 400 miles long -- from the Alps to the Atlantic. Then there's the Dolomites in Italy, Turks in Arabia -- there used to be a Russian Front but they quit last year so they could kill the Tzar and have a revolution.Who's that?Ares? As in the God of War?Look, Princess, I like your spirit, and maybe you know something I don't, but this war is so sprawling, there's nothing the two of us can do about it. But we can try to get to the men who can.I'm starting to understand why your mother didn't want you to leave. How much do you really know about the rest of the world?The great books. Those books explain why there are no men on that island? Or kids?Just you? Sheltered upbringing.Oh. Well, that's not how babies are made where I come from.I refer to more than that.You know about that?All twelve, huh? You bring any of them with you?Good morning. We got lucky, caught a ride. Made good time.Welcome to jolly ol' London.Eh. It's not for everyone.Diana!Well, because they're... together.No, we're not together... I mean, like that. Look, we need to go this way.Technically, that's the way to war.I have to get this notebook to my superiors.Oh, boy. Okay... Dammit. Come with me to deliver this, then we'll talk about getting you a train ticket.I need to change. And you...We need to get you some clothes.Because you aren't wearing any.Well, women don't exactly --And that one wasn't made out of clay.At least try it on.Where is she?Etta, the whole point was to make her less conspicuous.It'll be safe. You can trust her. I don't think we're going to run into Ares at the meeting.Come on.Hopefully nothing.Quite a reception.Where did I put that thing?Stay behind me!Or not.How'd you do that?Stay here.Colonel!Sorry. Phillip! Phil!That's why they won't let him speak.Most of `em.I'm sorry, sir, but the intel I've brought back is very time sensitive. We were attacked by men looking for it on the way here. One of Maru's notebooks.We need to get it to Cryptography. And I need an immediate audience with the Generals --Prince, Diana Prince. We... she and I... we work together. She helped me get this notebook here. From Maru's lab --She's my... secretary.She's a very good secretary.General, you have to find out where they're making this gas. Burn it to the ground. Destroy it.Sir, I saw this gas with my own eyes. All the men on the front line could die on both sides unless you --Pull the troops out. Send me in. With some strategic support, I could take Ludendorff and his operation out myself.But, General --Yes, sir. I understand, sir.Diana. I know it's confusing --She's with me. With us.Diana. Enough. My apologies, sir.Diana, wait!Because there was no chance of changing his mind! Listen to me --WE'RE GOING ANYWAY!Diana, I'm a spy. That's what we do. Now are you coming or not?I'm taking you to the front. And we're probably going to die.This is a terrible idea... Come on. If we're going to get to the front on our own... we're gonna need reinforcements.Relatively good.Which Prince was that? I need to talk to you, Prince Madras Angora Cashmere...Sameer. This is Diana.Sameer's a top undercover man. Can talk the skin off a cat in as many languages as you.Where's Charlie?That's not Charlie.That's Charlie. The two GRUNT at one another in Scottish slang, but the Bruiser sees Charlie's got friends -- and quickly leaves. The surprisingly cheerful CHARLIE gets to his feet.All right, Charlie?Charlie here's an expert marksman. He shoots people.Two days tops. We need supplies and passage to Belgium --We're dropping her off at the front.I assume you're here to stop us.If there is another weapons facility, find it and destroy it. Along with Ludendorff and Maru.Thank you, sir.I'll take you to the front, but I can't make any promises about finding `your friend' any more than I can Santa Claus.Train leaves in a few minutes.Hungry?It's ice cream.Forget the countries or the territory or the Generals. This is what we're really fighting for.We've got to get a move on. Chief won't wait.Smuggler. Very reputable.Careful, I might get offended.I went undercover and pretended to be something else, I shot people on your beach, and I smuggled a notebook. Liar, murderer, smuggler. You still coming?In this war? Every kind.Chief!She found me.It's a long story.British tea for the Germans. German beer for the British.Edgar Rice Burroughs novels for both sides.Ludendorff was last seen at the front -- -- near the Somme. Front's about three miles away. Chief will get us there.As soon as we have daylight, we move. I'll take first watch.You're going to get cold. Here.You wanted me to take you to the war. This is it. The front lines.We need to stay on mission.There's nothing we can do about that.This is no man's land, Diana. It means no man can cross it. This is the worst point on the entire front. This battalion has been here for nearly a year and they've barely gained an inch because on the other side are Germany's deadliest soldiers. Pointing machine guns at every square inch of this place. This is not something you can cross. It's not possible.We are doing something. We can't save every person in this war. Besides, it's not what we came here to do.DIANA, NO!!!She's drawing their fire! Let's go!Go!Bell tower.Charlie!There is if you jump!Veld. Tiny village. It's probably not even on the --Have you found Ludendorff's operation?German High Command?Actually, that gala's perfect cover --What is it?Ares? You mean Ludendorff.Sir, this is our chance to find the gas and learn how Ludendorff plans on delivering it. Maybe our only chance. Our last chance --I'm sorry, sir, you're breaking up.Drinks later, Sameer. I need you to rustle up me a German uniform.It's an acquired taste.It has hints of different flavors, if you look for them.You did this.You have dancing on `Paradise' Island?Interpretive?Excuse me?You're not going to the gala.Because you don't know how to dance, for one thing.That's kinda the point.It's a snowfall.You're right.This and other things.I don't know. They... make breakfast.Read the newspaper. Go to work -- They... get married. Maybe have babies, grow old together.No idea.God, I hope you're right.Guys, I'm fully aware that I said this job was two days --There's no more money, boys.You're not their type.It's true... every word.How the hell are we gonna get in?It won't look at all suspicious when I come sauntering out of the woods on foot --You're not going in. It's too --I know how to do stealth -- been doing it my whole life. I'll follow them to wherever they're working on the gas or better yet find out where it is.Plus, we can't make a scene.Diana, what you're wearing doesn't exactly qualify as `undercover.'There's no way to get you in. Let me scout it and report back. Worse case, we follow Ludendorff when he leaves and you can use that magic lasso of yours to get him to tell us where it is.You can't go into German High Command and kill anyone! You have to trust me, Diana.Where did that come from?Diana. Please, stay put.And your head's empty! He wants my invitation, you idiot!Keep the car running, Sahib. And no joy riding.Excuse me.No, but I've been watching you. Following your career, I mean. You're Dr. Isabel Maru. The most talented chemist in the German Army. I'm a fan.I hope I'm not crossing a line. I hear you and General Ludendorff are very close.I'm sure he provides a great deal of support for you and your work, but having someone like me behind you -- I could provide a lot more.A man who would show you the appreciation a genius like yourself deserves.I love fire, don't you? It's like a living act of entropy. The ultimate weapon of destruction, reminding us that, in the end, everything returns to the ash it once came from. There's something reassuring about it. I see all of that in your eyes.Perhaps you could show me what you're working on. I hear it's extraordinary.You agreed to wait.You can't kill Ludendorff inside German High Command. The Armistice won't be signed.What if you're wrong, Diana? What if there is no Ares?I can't let you do this.Diana!The gas.It was Ludendorff.Wherever he goes you follow him.Diana.Diana, I'm sorry --No, I --It's a signal from The Chief. They followed Ludendorff --Diana?!Diana!Diana?Right... Then we've got to do something about it.Diana, I'm sorry... I know you thought -- I hoped it, too -- but I knew --That it might not be that simple.Because maybe people aren't... just good, Diana. Ares or no Ares. Maybe it's... just them.Diana, sometimes people are complicated --It's not about whether they deserve it or not. It's about what you believe. You think I don't get it? All I've seen out there? I wish I could tell you that there was one `bad guy' to blame. Maybe we're all to blame. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to do better. And if you believe this war should stop, Diana, if you want to stop it, then help me stop it. Now.If we don't, they're going to kill thousands more.Don't give up on them. Don't give up on me.Please. We gotta go... I have to.We're on our own.Sammy, let's go!There's not much we can do... if that's what I think it is.But we can stop that plane.No, if it crashes, it'll wipe out everyone for fifty square miles. We gotta ground it.Is it flammable, Chief?I need you guys to clear me a path to that plane.I have the plane.You destroy the lab! Go!Diana...Diana! I have to go.No. It has to be me. I can save today, you can save the world.
