The faces look alike. You gotta use memory tricks: each has some peculiarity -- it keeps you sharp. A D.D. told me when a drug dealer starts writing a diary it's time to quit. I started writing after that. Not every night -- now and then. Just to burn off the night. Fill up one book, throw it out, start another.Ann.Robert.Sad what ten years without sex can do.Twenties -- and tens.You mean --?Cash Before Delivery. CBD.It's late. You staying?I'm gonna crash -- try, at least.Yeah -- big kiss.\"Labor Day.\" \"Union Movement\" -- there's a contradiction in terms. I know about long hours. It's worse when I'm off -- I just walk and walk. Where am I going? There's an element of providence to it all. Like rolling numbers. Luck. You're walking down the street, some guy that looks maybe a little like you does a stick-up four hours ago, there's an APB description out and a cop pulls you in cause he's cold and wants to go inside -- they grab your stash. Your number's up. You're busted for nothing. For bad luck.Don't bore me.Jees --We pay you more, you put up with more. White drugs for white people. Twice the price, twice the safety.Never made any big money either.She blows it.She always says that. We'll see, Jealous.No way. I'm not the management type. I get in charge, I'll start using again -- not for me. I know music people. I'm gonna get in recording.What?Why?I look like an encyclopedia? Who knows? Thanks for the warning.Yeah, nineteen grams after four times last night. We're certainly not his favorite people.He took my hundreds.Who's Her Majesty talking to?That's where the money is.Don't dress. You really think she means it?That's just her mouth talking.\"Akasha\"?-- this week. I don't get it -- marigolds, violets, sage -- why'd anyone pay to put weeds on their face?You forget: she hasn't asked me.Of what?Very nice.How about Indian?I'm going veggie.

Look at yourself. Sit down. I've known you, what, like eight years?Knew you from the other job, the one before the last one you fucked up. I knew your wife -- remember her? We used to sit and talk and talk --This is no good. I'll sell you a gram and some downs, but I ain't gonna put you in the emergency room. Cool it. Go to bed. Sleep it off.So go to the street.Go ahead. You know what she'll say. Phone's over there.Fuck you. That's it. You're out. Don't call again. Catch you next lifetime.Okay.You got downs? One more thing. I gotta use the phone.I've got to go.Everybody wants to talk. It's like a compulsion. My philosophy is: you got nothing to say, don't say it. They figure you can tell a D.D. anything, things they would never tell anyone else. He understands. Of course they're stoned to start. If I could tie together all the hours of coke talk I've heard, that would be a lot of string. It was Robert's idea to add twenty-five dollars to home deliveries cause it's such a hassle. Fifty is more like it.Me? I'm an old man. She'd break me like an old horse.Nah. Thanks anyway. I gotta go. Have fun.Carlos. Wait a second.Marianne! Marianne! Hop in! I'll give you a ride.John.

She came up to sell, have parties, make contacts. She was so glamorous. I just wanted to be around her. She'd sit up listening to coke stories. Now it's me and Robert.
