Honey, were they the same ones? Don't cry.He's looking for answers. He's Upset..He did. He turned the other cheek and they punched it.You're late. I'll try again later. Horus finds his hat on the table. His eyes fall on Mary, her back to him. She's glued to the set.Yes.What could you do? Horns - hat in hand, goes to the door. He wants to stay.Coffee's by the... door.There's something about him... I don't know. A female REPORTER concludes the footage...Just a quick one.I want to.\"Once there was a way, to get back homeward. Once there was a way, to get back home.\"Shut up.\"Sleep pretty darling, do not cry. And I will sing a lullaby...\"\"Golden slumber fills your eyes. Smiles awake you when you rise.\" Hancock wavers on consciousness - quite unlike him.No... no... no!Glasses.You know Hancock?Which piece would you like?Horus is in the securities business.It's a large department store, over a couple million in merchandise... stereos, jewelry. On three floors.Horus, what do I do?What do I do with him... when you're gone? I have to entertain this super... She doesn't finish her... A NOISE interrupts her - seizes the participants.Aaron.He comes home crying.Oh, I forgot to make coffee. She rushes into the kitchen. Horus stops her.No, I'll make it right now.What're you doing? She's taken by this scene.About him?No. They're lying through their collective teeth.Go to sleep. You know what dad says. Tomorrow always feels better...Have a good one.What were you doing in the street? You ripped it pretty good.It'll be all right.It's just the seams. I can sew it back.This. It's just the seams.'I'll take good care of it.Yes. Me. I can. And I'll re-button it for you, all right? Hancock acknowledges with a smile - a slight one.Let's see.Come on, I want to see.I saw it, right? A little cloud. She peers into his hands - where only a pool of wetness remains. And with her fingers, Mary reaches inside to feel the rain. Hancock watches this - the innocence in her face, as her hand touches his. He stares down at her hand... at the wedding ring. Mary-pulls her hand away.The water is dirty.It's not your fault.You should slow down. Rest.It must be hard.To always do right... do good when all you want to do is rest.Where... who are you?You probably get a lot of practice explaining yourself, on account of who you are and what you do.It's like, everything you say sounds... so perfect. Like you rehearse them so they'll be that way. I mean, not to say that it's insincere...So, you never answered. Back there... what were you doing in the middle of the street?You're still up? She moves behind the bathroom door. Self-conscious.Nick's market. Are you sick?You want some milk? I'll heat it up for you, how about that?Yes, he is. He sits there in bed, struggling with the words. Mary continues dressing - oblivious.Yes.What facts? He's not a hero.Aaron likes him.No. I have to start on dinner. So how about that glass of milk? Horus - shakes his head, annoyed.All right. Try to get some sleep. With that, she's out the door. Horns alone in bed, staring into the vanity mirror at his wretched face. He spots a brown paper BAG on the chair. Goes to inspect. Inside - Hancock's tattered trenchcoat. Oy, what does it mean? Horus returns to bed, distraught. He buries himself under the cover.All right, already. How's your mouth?Hold still.Shut up.Horus?Horus? She brushes hair off her apron. Moves into the living room, the bedroom - no husband. She goes to the front door. Opens it into the stairway outside. There on the stairs and down below, Hancock stands - on his way up. Mary sees him... and they look at each other.Aaron, hold it. Hancock shoves his fist up close, almost between the boy's eyes. So there it is, the fist - this petrified mass of knuckles and bones. It SNARLS at Aaron. Hancock holds it there, fingers locked together - like he can't let go of them. Aaron swallows - in awe. Mary watches her guest, the change in him.Hancock? The sound of her voice takes him. He snaps out of it.Your hair. Come on, have a seat.Shut up, kid. Hit the showers. And the n homework.There... my hero. He inspects himself via a hand MIRROR. Smiles. Politely.I started out just trimming for Horus. Here and there. He had to look just right for the academy, says his father, a police captain there... in Philly. When we moved here, I pretty much took over as the resident barber. You know, to save some money.His father's idea. Not his. He went through it anyway, like he had something to prove... the validation of his manhood.Want?The hair... I need to...Yes?Why... what for? They're eye to eye. Close.Yes. Inside Aaron's head: My mother + Hancock? Nah!All right. Go to your room. I'll get the ice pack. Aaron exits. Mary exits. Hancock - alone and on his knees. He finally rises. Heads for the front door. Mary returns with the ice pack. Catches him...You're leaving?I'm sorry.Really? On the boardwalk?I'm sorry. She goes to him, without words to say. In this silence, he stares at her his eyes, glazed with thought.Good night.What? Aaron inspects his Superman lunchbox.Eat... and we'll go. Where's your father? She grabs a comb and proceeds to part Aaron's hair.I'm'sorry, honey. I was hoping daddy'll be home before we leave. I'm sorry.What?Is everything all right?Tell me what's wrong. He points to the distant ocean - where the horizon curves into darkness.Please, Hancock. What are you talking about? What's out there?Hancock... what...Me? What can I do? What do you want me to do?How? Hancock leans forward. Towards Mary. And kisses her. Their lips lock, twisted and entwined... until Mary, composing her senses, pulls away.Don ' t.I can't.I love him. The death blow.I love him. I'm sorry. One can almost hear life's precious air seeping out of this superman - he'd slump over if not for the muscles of steel. Mary wants to console... but what can she do?I'm sorry.Horus...What happened toyou?Where... Aaron, he's not wasted. Go to your room.What do you think you're doing, Horus Longfellow? Horus gauges her.Horus, what're you talking about? Who did this to your face? Horus rises from his seat with mustered strength.Why do you say that?L are. Did You're a fool, that's what you you think I was completely blind when I married you? Something cuts at your masculine ego and it's the pressure... the standard's unreasonable. The woman, she wants me to part oceans. That's the kind of bull shit's made of. I went w through it...,I was there when the hurt came, when the academy said no. I there.

Puts it on.Horns, what are you doing? Inserts the flashlight into his holster.Horus!\"Once there was a way, to get back homeward...\"once there was a way, to get back home...\" Her voice grips him. Torments him...\"Sleep pretty darling, do no t cry. And I will sing a lullaby...\"Sleep tight. She leaves. Aaron stops her by the door.What're you doing? Hancock closes in. Corners her.Hancock, please. He reaches down and untangles Mary from her son - she concedes out of fear for Aaron.Stay back, Aaron! Hancock takes her away - like booty. Aaron dangles from his cape, trying to save his mother.. In vain. The superhero springs into the night - with his woman.What're you doing?Please. But there's no denying this superman - he grabs her, running his hand down her back and between her buttocks.No...I'm cold.. Hancock does not respond.What have you dome?Horus!Please, Hancock.

Too late.I'm sorry.I've been tired, lately.-So people tell me.Hard?It's harder to not do anything. What am I? It's not for me. It's for... it is about people. Rest? When there is despair? I cannot.

He swats the kid off his back.You're getting on my nerves.What I got to do.Please... A sudden burst of anger seizes Mary. She SCREAMS... STRIKES Hancock across the face.Help me.Make it go away, Mary. Mary huddles against the wall..She watches on, watching him struggle.No... do what I got to do. He unloads a PUNCH. PUNCTURES brick. Clear through...Go away! Go. Away. The authorities - they pause, startled. They open FIRE. Cops. S.W.A.T. teams. Their cousins. Bullets ZIP through the air and with dead accuracy. Hundreds of shells strike Hancock - the target. They PING off his armor of superFLESH. He stares at them all, invincible.Go away!I made them go away.The noise...Why?!You ready to rock it up? Horus runs - he runs for an overturned S.W.A.T. VAN. Hancock follows, toying with the man. Horus disappears inside.Come out, you little shit. A pause in action - no reply from Horus.Are you a man?! Horus answers... He storms out with a ROCKET LAUNCHER.

Horus enters. Stands awkwardly before his son.Yeah I will. And I don't want any girly make-up on my face. Horus deposits himself on the bed. Hunches over-h13 knees..after a good night sleep. The light FLICKS off and the man's silhouette form exits the room.I got the only mother does this. in the world that I'm not lisMARY g. Lalalala..,I know it. I know it.What?What? Nothing. It's fine.What? Not here, mom.I know it, mom. Can I go now?Geez! He turns back. Plants a kiss on Mary's smiling cheeks.All right, mom. He leaves, merging into the undulating sea of children.You were late.The asshole peed on me. I'm dog shit.Get a grip, mom. They arrive home, both storming through the entrance and up the stairs.Can't sleep. He rolls over the sofa, next to his mother. They watch VIDEO clips of the foiled bank heist: the crashing Chevy, the aerial maneuvers, the sheer invincibility of this man.Don't.Mom.Oh, mom.What?Principles?What am I suppose to do?I wanted... there were three of them.He gets away. Hancock inhales what's left of his cigarette. Blows smoke.What're you saying?What?Why're you telling me all this?Table's done. Mary turns to Aaron, offscreen.Geez. Horus enters from the hallway, disheveled from sleep. He does not see the superman on his sofa. He continues into the kitchen.He comes for dinner. Close on Hancock. Close on Horus.You want milk?It makes mom fart, too. Mary CHOKES on her food. Drops her fork. She maneuvers, in the allotted space, for the utensil - and finding difficulty. Hancock grabs the table, one arm. Lifts it off the carpet and above everyone's head. Mary, startled, impressed, all of the above. She picks up the fork.Good arm.On the right. He leaves to find bladder relief - leaving Horus to his family.What do you think, mom?mom?I wanted to kill him.I want to deck him, just once. So bad I tense up... like I can't even move.Did not. Not crying. It was pissed-off.Thinking. Mary goes over to the bed. Sits.No. Not really. Are you?Me neither. I was thinking.., about tomorrow.I know, mom... after a good night sleep. He says that but he's the one working every night. Does that mean he never feels better? He's always feeling terrible?Mom? She turns.I got to do what I got to do. She watches him go -curious.Don't mess with me. He struts out of the alley. Shifts into a mad sprint, adrenaline taking him away..o his mouth was. open and he just stared up at me, it hurt that bad. And while he narrates, Mary runs her fingers through his hair - a mother grooming her child. Meanwhile, Horus listens concerned.\"Don't mess with me.\" Mom, remember that guy in the cop movie... he said that?It doesn't hurt, I told you.He said tomorrow, he'd pi ck me up again...God, my friends will freak. Horus freezes - fades back to his meal, unheard.I like it long.it's almost eight. Dad's late.like this? How do you make a fist?Mom's going butcher your hair.Oh, mom. I want to talk to him. Tell her, Hancock. Hancock shrugs a \"what can I do.\"Yeah, right. I know. I got to do what I got to do.Mom? Mary bursts from her perch - regroups, awkwardly. Aaron stands in the hallway, his hair still wet from the shower.my mouth. It's starting to swell. I think he loosened a tooth. Mary - maternal duty calls.Mom.'The toast's burnt.We're late... you forgot the corn chips. Mary serves up-the eggs - sunny side up. 1. and down... and all over the place.You forgot the corn... . ouch!You having your period, mom? She responds with a brisk slap to the head... SMACK.Are you all right, mom?You're acting weird.I'm late for class. Go home, mom. I think it's time for your nap. Aaron leaves. Pensive, Mary begins her walk... to the boardwalk.Hi.I saw you walking. Where were you today? You said you'd... be there. Hancock - looking over Aaron's abused frame.Where are you going? Can I go?Those assholes got me in the bathroom, today... and you said you'd pick me up at school. Hancock turns. He's upset now.Dad, are you wasted?He is wasted. Horus rises, under great difficulty. Feels his way to the sofa. When Mary tries to assist, he waves her away.But dad...Thanks, mom.Mom. Tomorrow always feel bette r.Probably.Don't you fucking touch her! Mary SCREAMS. Hancock cringes, says...Don't touch her you bastard!No! Mom!Let me go you bastard.Dad! He breaks loose - running into his father's arms, crying.I'm sorry dad. I didn't know what to do...I'm sorry, dad. I'm sorry.Damn right, dad. We got to get her. Horus at the screen - oblivious. \"What can I do?\"Dad.
