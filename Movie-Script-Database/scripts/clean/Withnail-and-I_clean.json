{"Withnail-and-I": {"I:": {"raw_line": "I'm having a cup of tea, do you want one?Do you want a cup of tea Withnail!? Withnail: No.I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear anything. Oh God, it's a nightmare out there I tell you. Withnail [pouring some wine]: We've just run out of wine what are we going to do about it?I don't know. I don't know. I don't feel good. Look! My thumbs have gone weird. I'm in the middle of a fucking overdose. My hearts beating like a fucked clock. I feel dreadful, I feel fucking dreadful. Withnail: So do I. So does everyone. Look at my tongue. A grey yellow sock. Sit down for Christ's sake, what's the matter with you? Eat some sugar.Where's the coffee? Withnail [reading from the paper]: \"In a world exclusive interview 33 year old shot putter Geoff Woade who weight 317 pounds, admitted taking massive doses of anabolic steroids, drugs banned in sport. It used to get him bad tempered and act down said his wife. He used to pick on me. But now he's stopped his much better in our sex life and in our general life.\"Please! I don't feel good. Withnail: That's what you'd say but that wouldn't wash with Geoff. No! He'd like a bit of pleading. Add spice to it. In fact, he'd probably tell you what he was going to do before he did it. \"I'm going to pull you head off\". \"Oh no, please, don't pull my head off\". \"I'm going to pull your head off because I don't like your head!\"Coffee Withnail: Why don't you use a cup like any other human being?Why don't you wash up occasionally like any other human being? Withnail: How dare you!? How dare you!? How dare you call me inhumane!?I didn't call you inhumane, you merely imagined it. Calm down. Withnail: Right you fucker - I'm going to do the washing up!No no you can't. It's impossible I swear it. I've looked into in. Listen to me listen to me. There are things in there, there's a tea-bag growing. You haven't slept in sixty hours you're in no state to tackle it. Wait till the morning we'll go in together. Withnail: This is the morning. Stand aside!You don't understand. I think there may be something alive. Withnail: What do you mean? a rat?It's possible, it's possible. Withnail [brandishing his comb]: Then the fucker will rue the day!I told you. you've been bitten! Withnail: Burnt, burnt, the fucking kettle's on fire.There's something floating up. Withnail [with a fork in his hand]: Fork it!No no no, I don't want to touch it. Withnail: You must you must. The poop will boil through the glaze. We'll never be able to use the dinner service again.No, no, no, no, no, no. Give me the gloves. Withnail: That's right, put on the gloves. Don't attempt anything without the gloves.Matter. Withnail: Matter? Where's it coming from?Don't look. Don't look. I'm dealing with it! Withnail: I think we've been in here too long. I feel unusual. I think we should go outside.It'll get better, it has to. Withnail: Easy for you to say lovey. You've had an audition. Why can't I have an audition. It's ridiculous: I've been to drama school. I'm good looking. I tell you, I've a fuck sight more talent that half the rubbish that gets of TV. Why can't I get on TV?Well I don't know. It'll happen. Withnail: Will it? That's what you say. The only programme I'm likely to get on is the fucking news. I tell you, I can't take much more of this. I'm going to crack.I'm in the same boat. Withnail: Yeah, yeah. I feel as sick as a pike. I'm going to have to sit down.You know what we should do? I say, you know what we should do? Withnail: How should I possibly know what we should do? What should we do?Get out of it for a while. Get into the countryside. Rejuvenate. Withnail: Rejuvenate! I'm in a park and I'm practically dead. What good's the countryside? What time is it?It's eight. Withnail: Fours hours to opening time. God help us. Have we got any embrocation?What for? Withnail: To rub on ourselves you fool. We'll cover ourselves in deep heat and get up against a radiator. Keep ourselves alive until twelve.Why don't you ask your father for some money. If we had some money we could go away. Withnail [inspecting a bottle for dregs]: Why don't you ask your father. How can it be so cold in here. It's like Greenland in here. We've got to get some booze. It's the only solution to this intense cold. Something's got to be done. We can't go on like this. I'm a trained actor reduced to the status of a bum. I mean look at us! Nothing that reasonable members of society demand as their rights! No fridges, no televisions, no phones. Much more of this and I'm going to apply for meals on wheels.What happened to your cigar commercial? Withnail: That's what I want to know. what happened to my cigar commercial. What happened to my agent? Bastard must have died.September. Bad patch. Withnail: Rubbish. Haven't seen Gylgod down the labour exchange. Why doesn't he retire.What are you talking about? Withnail: The thermostats. what have you done to them?I haven't touched them. Withnail: Then why has my head gone numb. I must have some booze. I demand to have some booze.Because I don't advise it. Even the wankers on the site wouldn't drink that. That's worse than meths. Withnail: Nonsense, this is a far superior drink to meths. The wankers don't drink it because they can't afford it.No we have nothing. Sit down! Withnail: Liar, you've got antifreeze.You bloody fool. You should never mix your drinks! [Withnail laughs histerically, collapses to the floor and emits unpleasant vomitting noises.]Perfume on my boots. I had to scrub the with essence of petunia.If my father was loaded I'd ask him for some money. Withnail: If your father was my father you wouldn't get it. Barman: : There you are lads. Withnail: Chin chin. [Withnail chinks his glass against the other, which I has not picked up yet, and downs the gin in one. I follows suit but gags slightly.]Ugh. What about what-his-name? Withnail: What about him?Why don't you give him a call. Withnail: What for?Ask him about his house. Withnail: You want me to call what-his-name and ask him about his house?Why not? Withnail: Alright. what's his number?I've no idea - I've never met him. Withnail: Well neither have I. What the fuck are you talking about?Your relative with a house in the country. Withnail: Monty? Uncle Monty?That's him. That's the one. Get the Jag fixed up. Spend the weekend in the country. Withnail: Alright. Give us a tenner and I'll give him a bell.Get a couple more in. I'm going for a slash. [Next to the door to the gents is a rather large Irish man sat with his pint and his paper.]Balls to Monty we're getting out. Withnail: Balls to Monty!? I've just spent an hour flattering the bugger.There's a man over there doesn't like the perfume. The big one. Don't look, don't look. We're in danger, we've got to get out. Withnail: What are you talking about?I've been called a ponce. [Withnail turns to address the room in general.]Speed is like a dozen transatlantic flights without ever getting off the plane. Timechange. You lose, you gain. Makes no difference so long as you keep taking the pills. But sooner or later you've got to get out because it's crashing then all at once the frozen hours melt out through the nervous system and seep out the pores.Why are we having lunch in here? Withnail: It's dinner and Danny's here.Danny!? How did he get in? Withnail: I let him in this morning. He lost one of his clogs. He's come in because of the perpetual cold. I hope the buggers sales plummet.I've got your savaloy. Here. I don't want it. Withnail: Then stick it in the soap tray and save it for later.Don't vent spleen on me. I'm in the same boat. Withnail: Stop saying that. You're not in the same boat. The only thing you're in that I've been in is this fucking bath.Danny's here. Head hunter to his friends. Head hunter to everybody. He doesn't have any friends. The only people he converses with are his clients and occasionally the police. The purveyor of rare herbs and prescribed chemicals is back. Will we never be set free?Danny. Danny: You're looking very beautiful man. Have you been away? St. Peter preached the epistles to the apostles looking like that. Have you got any food.Mmm, As a matter of fact, got a savaloy. Danny: How much is it?You can have it for nothing. [Danny sniffs the sausage. Withnail enters from the kitchen gluing the sole back on his shoe. He is wearing a rather expensive looking suit.]That's alright Danny. We'd decided to lay off for a bit. Danny: That's what I thought. Except for personal use I concur with you. as a matter of fact i was thinking of retiring and going into business Withnail [Scoffing]: Doing what? Danny: The toy industry.No. Danny: Then why's he wearing that old suit? Withnail: Old suit? This suit was cut by Hawke's of Saville row. Just because the best tailoring you've ever seen is above you fucking appendix doesn't mean anything. Danny: Don't get uptight with me man. Because if you do I'll have to give you a dose of medicine and if I spike you you'll know you've been spoken to. Withnail: You wouldn't spike me you're too mean. Besides, there's nothing invented I couldn't take. Danny: If I medicined you you'd think a brain tumour was a birthday present. Withnail: I could take double anything you could. Danny [removing his sunglasses]: Very, very foolish words man.He's right Withnail. Look at him . His mechanisms gone. He's had more drugs than you've had hot dinners. Withnail: I'm not having this shag-sack insulting me. Let him get his drugs out.That's sense Withnail. Withnail: You can stuff it up your arse for nothing and fuck off while you're doing it. Danny: No need to insult me man. I was leaving anyway. Have either of you got shoes?Sherry. Monty: Sherry.What's all this. The man's mad. Withnail: Eccentric.Eccentric? He's insane. Not only that he's a raving homosexual.He's a madman. Any moment now he's going to rush out and get into his tights. Withnail: Ok ok. Give me a minute.The house or out.No, I wish I could. It's just thoughts really. Monty: Have you published?No no. Monty: Where did you school? Withnail: He went to the other place Monte. Monty: Oh you went to Eton? [The cat reappears on I's chair.]What's all this going off in private business? Why did you tell him I went to Eton? Withnail: Because it wouldn't have helped if I hadn't.What do you mean by that? Withnail [Showing him the key to the cottage.]: Free to those that can afford it. Very expensive to those that can't.Shut up. Withnail: Little tarts they love it.Listen, I'm trying to drive this thing as quietly as possible. If you don't shut up we'll get stopped by the police. [The pass a notice anouncing an accident blackspot.]What do you want a child for? Withnail: To tutor it in the ways of righteousness and procure some uncontaminated urine. [He takes out the bottle and instructions provided by Danny.]No, we're not we're here and we're in the middle of a fucking gale. Now you'll have to keep a look out your side. If you see anything tell me. Get hold of that map. Withnail: Where's the whisky?What for? Withnail: I've got a bastard behind the eyes. I can't take aspirins without a drink. Where's the aspirin?Probably in the bathroom. Withnail: You mean we've come out here in the middle of fucking nowhere without aspirins?Where are we? Withnail: How should i know where we are. I feel like a pig shat in my head.Now get hold of that map and look for a place called Crow Crag.Give me the key and get out of the way. Withnail: If I don't get aspirin I shall die here on this fucking mountainside. [They enter the house. I lights a match and finds a lantern which he lights. As the light comes up the inside of the cottage becomes visible. It is rather spartan.]Monty! [He looks accross to Withnail who is sat dejectedly in a chair.]What are you doing? Withnail: Sitting down to enjoy my holidayRight, now we're going to have to approach this scientifically. First thing we've got to do is get this fire alight, then we split into two fact finding groups. I'll deal with the water and the plumbings, you check the fuel and wood situation. [A little later Withnail re-enters the cottage from a rather wet and windy night. He is holding a small stick.]What's that? Withnail: The fuel and wood situation. There's nothing out there except a hurricane. This place is uninhabitable. [They sit close to the fire, which is rather small.]Give it a chance. It's got to warm up Withnail: Warm up!? We may as well sit round a cigarette. This is ridiculous. We'll be found dead in here next spring. [He attemps half-heartedly to light a cigarette.]Well we've got enough furniture for tonight. Tomorrow we get down that farm and get some logs. Withnail: This is a mistake I tell you. This is a dreadful mistake.Me! [The door opens cautiously and an old woman peers out inquiringly.]I'm a friend of Montague Withnail. He's lent us his cottage. I wondered if you could sell us some food. Eggs and things. [She looks blankly at him.]What about wood and coal? [Again, he elicits no responce. Seeing she is wearing a hearing aid, he bends down and talks directly to it.]I'm not from London you know! Old woman: I don't care where you come from. [She slams the door. I walks away.][to himself] Not the attitude I'd been given to expect from the H E Bates novel I'd read. I thought they'd all be out the back drinking cider, discussing butter. Clearly a myth. Evidently country people and no more receptive to strangers than city dwellers. [He walks back to the house and addresses the door.]Do you think you could tell me where I could buy some coal and wood? Old woman: You'll have to see my son. He runs this farm.Where is you son? Old woman: Up in top field. You can't miss him, his legs bound in polythyne.Withnail you bastard wake up. [He bangs on the ceiling and moves to the sink to wash.]Oye, wake up you bastard you've got to get wood. [Withnail enters, dressed already and wrapped in a blanket.]I tried to get fuel and wood, there's a miserable little pensioner down there wouldn't give it me. Withnail: Where are we going to get it then?There's a man up on the mountain. Why he's up there, fuck knows, but he's up there with a leg bound in polythene, you can't miss him, he's your man. And have another look in that shed. Find anything. If you can't find anything, bring in the shed. [Later, they are sat down to a simple lunch.]How come Monty owns such a horrible little shack? Withnail: No idea.You never discuss your family do you? Withnail: I fail to see my family's of any interest to you. I've absolutely no interest in yours. I dislike relatives in general and in particular mine.Why? Withnail: I've told you why. We're incompatible. They don't like me being on stage. [He stands up and takes a foil from its bracket on the wall and strides up and down in actorly fashion.]Then they must be delighted with your career. Withnail: What do you mean?You rarely are. [Withnail points the sword menacingly, although there is a cork on the end.]Then get after it. That's the man. [They rush out of the cottage and pursue the tractor.]Stop Withnail: StopStop please! [The tractor driver notices them and stops.]Stop saying that Withnail, of course he's the fucking farmer. [To Parkin] We're friends of Montague Withnail, we desperately need fuel and wood. [The farmer shakes his head, bewildered.]Montegue Withnail, you must know him. Fat man, owns the cottage. Parkin: Ay, seen the fat man. London type. Queer sort. Think his name's French or something. Withnail: French!? Parkin: Ay, Adrian de la Touche. He hasn't been up year for couple of years. Last time I saw him, he were; he were with his son.Yeah, that's him. Withnail: Listen, we're bona fide. We're not from London. Could we have some fuel and wood? Parkin: Ay, I could bring you up some logs later but I've got the cows and that to feed first. Withnail: When?Shut up. That would be very kind of you. Erm, what about food? Do you think you could sell us something to eat? Parkin: I could bring you up a chicken but you'll have to go to the village really.That would be very kind of you Mr? Parkin: ParkinMr Parkin. What happened to your leg? Parkin: Got a randy bull up there. Give me one in knee! [They walk back inside. I claps Withnail on the back. Back inside, Withnail removes his boots and places them in the oven attached to the fire.]You want to get out the back don't you? Get some spuds up. Withnail: Sorry I can't. My boots are in the ovenYou'd go if you had boots? Withnail: Gladly [Withnail emerges from the back door with polythene bags tied around his feet. He walks into the garden and after a little unearths a potato.]Great. How much do we own you? Parkin: Pay us when you come downWhat about this chicken? Parkin: 's on back [Back inside I has left the chicken on the table. It is alive and looks round questioningly. He nudges Withnail to wake him.]Oye! Oye! Parkin's been. There's the supper! Withnail: What are we supposed to do with that?Eat it Withnail: Eat it!? Fucker's aliveYeah, you've got to kill it. Withnail: Me!? I'm the firelighter and fuel collecter.Yeah I know but I got the logs in. It takes away your appitite just looking at it. Withnail: No it doesn't I'm starving. How can we make it die?You've got to throttle them. Withnail, I think you ought to kill it instantly in case it starts trying to make friends with us. Withnail: Alright, you get hold of ir. I'll strangle it.I can't. Those dreadful, beady eyes! They stare you out! Withnail: It's a bloody chicken. Just think of it with bacon across its back! Right, I'll deal with this. You'll have to get its guts out.Never point guns at people. Extremely dangerous. Now what about this roasting dish? What are we going to cook it in? Withnail: You're the food and plummings man. I've no idea. I wish I'd found this an hour ago. I'd have taken great pleasure in gunning this pullet down.No it shouldn't. Right, we're going to have to reverse the roles. We can bake the potatoes in the oven and boil this bastard over the fire.No, it's going to need it's feet.Straddle them either side of that.With respect to what? Withnail: I'm thinking of changing my name.Too like Donald Woolfe [He hands the bag to Withnail and opens a gate. It is clearly marked 'Shut this gate']Here, changeover point. [Withnail slams the gate behind them but it doesn't fasten. They see Parkin on his tractor.]No Withnail: I suppose happiness is relative. I never thought it would be a polythene bag without the hole in it. [Parkin turns the tractor towards them, stops and runs towards them.]What's up with him? Parkin: Shut that gate, shut that bull!You didn't shut the gate! Parkin: Shut that gate, shut that bull! [A bull appears and pushes the gate open. Withnail thrusts the bag into I's hands and vaults the wall. I is left facing the bull in a narrow corridor between two walls.]Well that can't be sensible can it? The bastard's about to run at me Parkin: Well he's randy!Yeah, yeah. I know he is [Withnail has his cigarettes out and is lighting up.]Shut up Withnail! Parkin: Just run at it, shouting! Withnail: Do as he says, start shouting. It won't gore youA coward you are Withnail. An expert on bulls you are not! [He shouts and throws the shopping in the air. The bull roars, I shouts again and runs at it. It turns and retreats to its field.]What's all this army bollocks? Withnail: We got a drink didn't we? [Rather later, the pair are the only remaining customers. Raymond, wiping down the bar, is clearly leggless.]I think he means it [The door clatters open and a man in a thick coat walks in, leans over the bar and helps himself to a beer. I nudges Withnail. The man takes an eel from his trousers which wriggles around violently. He strikes its head on the bar and returns it to his trousers.]Ask him if we can have one Withnail: What for?So that we can eat it! 'We're fed up with stew' [They approach the bar.]Ask him if we can have one of those. Go on. Withnail: Excuse me, we were wondering if we could purchase a pheasant off of you Jake: No. Withnail: Come on old boy. What's in your hump? Jake: Those pheasants are for his pot. There eels are for my pot. Now what makes you think I should give you something for your pot? Withnail: What pot?Our cooking pot. Jake: Ah, he know. Here, give us a wheeze on that fag. [He takes the cigarette from Withnail's mouth and takes a draw. I gives him the remains of a packet.]There's black pudding in it. Withnail: Black puddings are no good to us. I want somethings flesh! Withnail: I think I'll call myself Donald Twain. Get down, get down. It's him, what does he want?Better get down there and ask him. Withnail: Don't be ridiculous, he's got a gun. Bastard's phycotic, you've only got to look at him. Withnail: this place has become impossible. Nothing to eat, freezing cold and now a madman on the prowl outside with eels.alright you've made your point. we pack up tomorrow and get out. Withnail: where are you going?I'm going for a slash Withnail: you can't go outside, i can't get my boots on when they're hot.then i'll go alone Withnail: no you won't these are the sort of windows faces look in at.alright then i won't have a slash Withnail: and in both our interests i think we should sleep together tonight.don't be ridiculous he;s not going to come up here in the dark. Withnail: yes he is and if he catches one of us off guard he's got a much better chance of dealing with the other.noha ha ha ha ha Withnail: what are you laughing abouti was dreaming Withnail: you frightened the piss out of me. move overwill you get out Withnail: noalright, i'll have to sleep in your bed Withnail: then i'll have to come with youalright you can stay but the gun goes Withnail: no, i have to keep the gun . i intend to stay awake until morning.it's my bed and i demand presidence. mad fucking bastardah ah. what. Withnail: i heard a noise.there is nothing get to bed. what was that? Withnail: listen listenprobably just foxes. perhaps its the farmer Withnail: at two in the morning? it's the killer. he's come to kill us. it's all your fault, you've even given him the fucking gun. I've got to get in. He's trying to get in.He can't, he'll go away. He's going away. Withnail: He's getting in thorough the window. He's sharpening the fucking knifewhere's the matches? Withnail: in the kitchen.alright. we'll have to tackle with him. you stay in bed and pretend to be asleep. when he goes for you i'll jump on his back. Withnail: no no, it'll be too late by then, i'll be knifed. we'll have to try and make friends with him. He's going to your room. it's you he wants. offer him yourself! we mean no harm. Monty: oh my boys, my boys.monty! monty monty! Withnail: monty you terrible cunt. what are you doing prowling round in the middle of the fucking night? Monty: i had a punctured tyre. i had to wait an eon for assistance. i'm sorry if i frightened you. i'll sleep in the other room if i mayanywhere you like Monty Monty: ah, good morning. did you sleep well?mmmm. you've been busy in here Monty: as a bee. I do appologise for last night, it was perfectly inconsidereate of me.that's perfectly alright monty. how did you repair the window? Monty: didn't break it. merely forced it a little. there was an empty wine bottle on the ledge. tomatoes. you better wake him, breakfast in fifteen minutes. Monty: The older order changeth giving way to the new and God forfills himself in many ways and soon, I suppose, I shall be swept away by some vulgar little tumor. My boys, we are at the end of an age. We live in a land of weather forcasts and breakfasts that set in. Shat on by Tories, shovelled up by labour. Now which of you is going to be a splendid fellow and go down to the Rolls for the rest of the wine?I'll go. Withnail: I'll go.No, I'll go - I need to see about digging the car out. Monty: But we have my car dear boy.Yes, but if it rains we're buggered. I mean... Monty: Stranded! Withnail: Leave this to meI'll come with you, I could do with a walk. Besides. I shall need you to work on the joint. I hear you're a little wizard in the kitchen. Withnail: Yeah, you the food and plumbings expert. [He starts putting his polythene bags on.] Monty: What on earth are those? Withnail: We forgot to bring our wellingtons. Monty: You mean you've been up here in all this beastly mud and oomska without wellingtons? This afternoon I'll take you both into Penryth and get you fitted with some good quality rubber boots. The kitchen. [Monty has an apron on and is holding another.] Monty: I brought two of these in case either of you were any good in the kitchen.I'm not. Monty: Oh, of course you are. Cooking's one of the natural talents. Garlic, rosemary and salt. [He hands I a large joint of meat in a paper wrapper. I puts it down on the side.]Look this is all very kind of you Monty but I really ought to be out there getting some work done on the car. Monty: You haven't time we're taking late luncheon at three.We'll have to leave by three Monty. Didn't he tell you? We've got to get back to sign on. Monty: Sign on!? At a labour exchange!?Yes, it's rather fashionable actually. All the actors do it. Even Redgrave. Monty: Couldn't you forgo for just this one occasion? I've come a very long way to see you both.Sorry can't. I mean, I'd love to stay but he's more adament to get back than I am. [Monty slips the apron over I's head and ties it behind him.] Monty: Then we must choose our moment and have a word with him. I'm sure together we could persuade him. Now, garlic, rosemary and salt. I can never touch meat until it's cooked. As a youth I used to weep in butchers shops. [I moves through to the lounge and looks in the bags of food on the table.]I can't find the rosemary. Monty: Can't find the rosemary! I'm sure we could find it together. [He leans accross I in a rather comprimising fashion.]perhaps it's in the other bag. Monty: Perhaps it is. Shall we look? [He reaches accross with his other arm cutting of any opatunity of escape. Withnail enters with the wine and puts the bags on the table.] Withnail: Sorry. Sherry's in there. [Monty exits to the kitchen armed with the sherry.]What do you mean sorry!? What's he doing here? We can't stay he won't leave me alone. Withnail: Alright, we'll get the dinner down then we'll leave. [In the kitchen Monty pulls the cork from the sherry and emerges with three different glasses.] Monty: I'm afraid we must drink from these. I hope their shapes will not offend your palates. Withnail: Chin chin. Monty: To a delightful weekend in the country. Penryth [Monty's car drives into Penryth and pulls up in the town centre. Withnail and I get out of the car. Compared to Monty and the car they look rather scruffy.] Monty: I do think you could at least have shaved. What will people think, you look like a pair of farm-hands. Get away from the car. [He takes out his wallet and hands Withnail two fivers.] Monty: Now, you get the wellingtons. I'm going to but some razors and shaving soap. I'll meet you here in half an hour. [Monty drives off] Withnail: Couple of blooms.One each. [He removes a fiver from Withnail's hand] Withnail: I think a drink don't you?What about the wellingtons? Withnail: Oh, bollocks to the wellingtons. We'll tell him there was a farmer's conference and they had a run on them. Inside the pub [I is on the telephone while Withnail is at the bar.]yeah, ok then. yeah. promise. [He puts down the phone and walks over to withail]Hasn't heard a thing. They're still seeing people. Withnail: You don't want to go to Manchester anyway; play a bloody soilder.I don't know if I do. Bloody good little theatre that. Withnail: It's not much of a part is it. They'd make you cut you hair off.So what, you'd loose a leg! BARMAN: time please gents. Withnail: Alright we're going to have to work quickly. A pair of quadruple whiskies and another pair of pints please. [Withnail and I emerge unsteadily from the pub.] Withnail: Where is he. Utterly aresholed.We're early. [I looks accross to some tearooms]We want to get in there don't we. Eat some cake. Soak up the booze. [They enter the Penryth tea-rooms. I sits down at a table and starts buttering the bread rolls on the table. Withnail, still standing, points to the table and addresses an elderly waitress, Miss Blennerhassit.] Withnail: Alright here? Miss B: No, we're closing in a minute. Withnail: We're leaving in a minute. Alright here? Miss B: What do you want? [He sits down at the table and makes a rather perfunctory examination of the menu.] Withnail: We'll have tea and cake. [An elderly man comes across to their table. He is the proprietor] P: Did you hear her? She said she'd closed. What do you want in here? Withnail: Cake and tea. what's it got to do with you? P: I happen to be the proprietor. Now, will you leave? Withnail: Ah good, I'm glad you're the proprietor. I was going to have to have a word with you anyway. We're doing a film up here, location see. We might want to do a film in here. P: You're drunk.Just bring out the cake. Withnail: Cake and fine wine. Miss B: If you don't leave we'll call the police. Withnail: Balls. We want the finest wines availible to humanity. We want them here and we want them now. P: The police, Miss Blennerhassit. [ I breaks off from stuffing breadrolls but hasn't quite emptied his mouth at the start]Don't do that Miss Blenerhassit. I'm warning you Miss Blennerhassit, if you do - you're fired. We are multi-millionaries. we'll buy this place and fire you immediately. Withnail: Yeah, that's right, we'll buy this place and install a fucking duke-box and liven all you stiffs up a bit. P: The police Miss Blenerhassit. Just tell them there are a couple of drunks in the Penryth tea rooms and we'd like them removed.We are not drunks, we are multi-millionaires. P: Come on Mabs, we'll keep them here until they arrive [She starts to dial] Withnail: You won't keep us anywhere. Miss B: Police please Withnail: We'll buy this place and have it knocked down.It's alright, 's alright. Our car has arrived. [He pulls back a curtain to reveal that indeed their car has arrived, in the form on Monty in the Rolls. They get up and I staggers out the door] Withnail: We're coming back in here. [He tries to lean on a convenient post but misses and staggers a bit. He points meaningfully at the various customers as he leaves, shutting his coat in the door.] The cottage [Withnail and I are sat inside. There is no sign of Monte. I has just finished shaving and is rubbing his face with a towel.]Where is he? Withnail: Sulking up the hill. He says he won't come down for lunch without an appology.Suits me, he can eat his fucking radish. [Unseen, Monte enters and addresses I] Monty: It's all you fault.I beg your pardon Monte. Monty: You lead him astray. Oh don't pretend you don't understand, I know what you're up to. [Withnail stands up and offers Monte a glass] Withnail: Sherry? Monty: Sherry!? Oh no, no, no, no. I'll fall straight into his trap. He's so mauve we don't know what he'll do next. [I walks out in distgust as Monte sips the sherry.] the kitchen [I is at the sink peeling potatoes. Monte enters] Monty: I'm preparing myself to forgive you. I think you've been punished enough. I think we better release you from the legume and transfer you talents to the meat. [he takes him by the hand into the lounge] Monty: You shouldn't treat each other so badly. He's been working his fingers to the bone and all you do is sit in here drinking. Now, he's going to revitalize himself in here while you finish the vegtables. Withnail: I don't know how to do them. Monty: Well of course you don't. You're incapable of indulging in anything but pleasure am I not right? [I merely smiles] Monty: You don't deserve such loyalty. Now come along, I'm going to teach you how to peel a potato. [He rolls up Withnail's sleeves and takes him unwillingly into the kitchen. Withnail swipes a glass of sherry off the table on the way there.] the dinner table [All three are sat around the table eating a good looking roast dinner. There is plenty of extra meat and a good supply of wine.] Monty: It's very stimulating getting back to a basic sort of lifestyle. Without effecened emotion and poisonous inhibition.Except the problem do tend to take the edge off it. Monty: What do you mean?There are no proper facilities Monty: All the glorious trials of youth dear boy. When I was a lad I'd rocket off on my tandem with Wrigglesworth and ride and ride. Find some old barn and fall asleep with the sweet perfume of hay on our lips. Withnail: Would it be in poor form to plagarise a toast? Monty: It depend entirely on the quality of the wine. In this case, it most certainly would not. Withnail: In that case, to a delightful weekend in the country. Monty: Oooh, we were expecting a volley of argument concerning Mr Redgrave. [I gives Withnail a look of daggers]You're forgetting Jake. Monty: Jake can wait too.Jake's not a friend Monte. I'd hoped to avoid telling you this, but there's a madman on the loose outside. Monty: Is this true? Withnail: Well, there's this local type. Poacher. We got into a bit of a tiff and he threatened me with a dead fish. Yes, it was rather amusing acutally. When you came into the house we thought it was him and we thought that you cleaning your boots was him sharpening the knife. Monty: Oh, how delicious!I'm going for a walk. Monty: Oh, wait for us dear boy, we'll all go. Outside the cottage [I is leaning on the wall. Withnail emerges and walks briskly over to him] Withnail: Look, I know what your thinking but I had no alternative. The old beggers come a long way and I didn't want to put the wind up him.You sensitivity overwhelms me. If you think you're having a weekends indulgence up here at his expense, which means him having a weekends induldgence up here at my expense you've got another thing coming. Withnail: Anyway, he sent me out to say the coffee's ready.I couldn't drink it. I've got a crick in my mouth from grinning. Withnail: Well stop smilling at him.I can't help it, I'm so uptight with him. The hillside. [The are walking through thick bracken listening to Monte expound on Oxford.] Monty: Longtemps, longtemps de teau cheveux. Oh, Bodelair. Brings back such memories of Oxford. I [voice over] followed by yet another anecdote about his sensitive crimes in a punt with a chap called Norman who had ref hair and a poetry book stained with the butter drips from crumpets. Monty: Indeed I often wonder where Norman is now. Probably wintering with his mother in Guilford, a cat, rain, vim under the sink and both bars on. But old now, there is no true beauty without decay. Withnail: Legium pro Britania Monty: How right you are, how right you are. We live in a kingdom of where royalty comes in gangs. Come on lads, the sky's bruising, night must fall and we shall be forced to camp.He's having my room. I want the room with the lock. Agree to that or I'm off. Withnail: Alright, alright [They stride off back to the cottage. Before they get there, they see Jake at the door. Monte looks at him through the binoculars]Good old Jake eh? And that's precisely the reason I'm off back to London. Come on, lets pack up and get off. Good old Jake, eh Withnail. Lets all have a laugh. Good old Jake. Monty: He's going away. [They walk down to the cottage. There is a hare tied to the door with a note attached. Withnail unfolds the note and hands it to Monte. Monty clearly has some difficulty in reading the note.] Monty: Here hare here. [The meaning dawns on him.] Monty: Here hare here! Withnail: Good old Jake. The cottage. [They are playing poker with bottle tops and a few coins. An old gramaphone is plaing in the background. The game is stud with two down cards - Monty has the ace of spades and two small spades showing, I just queen high] Monty: Ace bets two and it's over to you. Withnail: You two and up two.So that's four? Monty: That's four. [I puts in four. Monty deals the last set of cards.] Monty: Withnail: Denai surenum defit. [He deals I another queen to I] Monty: Oh, there she is. [He deals himself another spade] Monty: A possible flush. Well, it's the two queens to bet! [Still at the table, Monty winds up the gramaphone.] Monty: Another hand? [Withnail looks up and slumps in his chair. He is totally plastered.] Monty: I think we'd better get him to bed.No, he's down here. You're in my room, I'm in his room and he's down here. Monty: I wouldn't dream of depriving the poor fellow of his bed. Particularlly in that condition.It's what he wants! Withnail: No I don't I want to get to bed!Come on then luvy, lets get you to bed then. A good nights sleep will do us both some good. [He grabs Withnail under the arms and manouvers him out of the room.]We'll I'll say good night then Monty. Withnail: I want to be alone. [I staggers up the stairs with Withnail who mumers about wanting to be on his own. He drops him on the bed and dashes back to his own room to get his bedding. Before he can get back though Monty has come up the stairs and just finished locking the door.] Monty: He doesn't want to sleep with you.Right then, You're in there and I'll take the couch. I'll say night night then Monty. Monty: You already have. Twice! [Downstairs I frantically aranges the blankets on the settee. Monty enters]What is it Monty, I'm terribly tired I need to get to bed. Monty: But not that tired eh? Are you a sponge or a stone?I beg you pardon Monty? Monty: Do you like to sample all facets of life or do you shut yourself off from new experience.I voted conserative Monty: Loyalty isn't a matter of selection.I quite agree, it's more a matter of chosing to whom one is loyal. I'm terribly tired Monty, I need to get to bed. Monty: You must mustn't you. Off you go then. I'll sleep down here. It won't be the first time I've been left with the couch! [I is in bed. He has barricaded the door by propping a chair against the knob. There is a determined pushing at the door from the other side which dislodges the chair and Monty enters.] Monty: Boy! Boy! I know you're not asleep boy. But he is. I've been into his room. He won't hear a thing.No I'm not asleep. What is it Monty, what do you want. [I lights a candle. Monty sits down on the side on the bed.] Monty: I tried not to come, oh how I tried not to.There's something I've got to tell you Monty. Monty: There's no need to explain, he's told me everything.What! What's he told you? Monty: About how you came to Chelsea and you arrest in the totenham court road. He told me about your probelms, how you feel.Probelms, what problems? Monty: You are a toilet trader! Go with it boy, give into to it. It's like a tide. Don't let it ruin your youth as I nearly did over Eric.I'm not homosexual Monty Monty: Yes you are! Of course you are. You're only saying that to deny your relationship with him. It's not his fault that he can't love you any more that it's mine that I adore you. Can't we allow ourselves this one moment of indiscretion? He need never know.I don't care what he knows, you must leave Monty. [I gets out of bed and goes over to the door. Monty beats him to it.] Monty: I mean to have you even if it must be burgulary. [I races to the other side of the room. Monty advances.]Monty you must listen! We're in an affair, we have been for years. But he's estranged, he won't allow himself to admit it. That's why he's rejecting me while you're here. On my life Monty, this is the first time in six years we havn't slept together. I couldn't cheat on him, it would kill him. Monty: Oh my dear boy, if I'd realised that I'd never have attempted to come between you.I know that Monty, I respected you for your sensitivity, I thank you for it. Monty: You better go to himOh, I intend to. This instant. Withnail's room [Withnail is asleep in bed with the shotgun. I enters]Withnail you bastard wake up. Wake up you bastard before I burn this bastard bed down. Withnail: I deny all accusations. What do you want?I've just narrowly avoided having a buggery. And I've come in here with the express intention of wishing one on you. That said, I'm leaving for London. Withnail: Hold on, hold on. Don't let you imagination run away with you. [He light up and coughs up some phlem]I've just finished fighting a naked man. How dare you tell him I'm a toilet trader! Withnail: Tatical necessity. If I hadn't told him you were active we'd never have got the cottage.I wouldn't have wanted it, not with him in it. Withnail: I never thought he'd come all this way.Monty!? He'd go to New York. Withnail: Calcualted risk.What is all this calculated risk and tactical necessity. It's me, naked, in a corner. And how dare you tell him I love you? And how dare you tell him you rejected me? How dare you tell him that!? Withnail: Sorry about that, got a bit carried away. Sort of said it without thinking. [I takes the gun]Well let me tell you something Withnail, if he comes in my room again its murder and you'll be held resposible in law. The cottage [Withnail is eating lunch at the table. I is reading a note]'Perhaps it is just that the evesdropper should leave as his trade dictates, in secrecy and in the dead of night. I do sincerely hope that you will find the happiness that has saddly always been denied me. Yours faithfully, Montegue H Withnail.' Poor old bastard. Withnail: Now I must say, that represents a level of hippocrasy in you that I'd previously suspected but not noticed due to highly evasive skills.You'll suffer for this Withnail. What you have done will have to be paid for. Withnail: I'll say one thing for Monte; he keeps a sensational cellar. [There is a knock at the door.]Who is it. VOICE: Telegram. [I gets the telegram and opens it. He shows it to Withnail] Withnail: Well done.Well it doesn't mean to say I've got the part. They probably just want to see me again. Well, that settles it, we leave immediately. Withnail: What!?Get you stuff together, we leave in half an hour. Withnail: Don't be ridiculous, I need at least an hour for lunch. The car [Withnail is eating the lunch from a plate on his knee. It is raining heavinly and I's side of the windscreen is impossible to see through] Withnail: You got a truck coming up in this lane followed by a slow right-hander.This is insanity Withnail: Stay in this laneWhat lane, I can't see any lane. Withnail: Bear right, bear right.I can't keep this up. And I must get some sleep. The car [It is daytime again, and the rain has stopped.I is asleep in the back on the car. The car jerks around and he woken. As he looks out the window, the camera moves with his view. The car is hurtling down the motorway swerving between the other cars.]What's going on? Withnail: I'm making time.Pull over, you haven't got a license. Withnail: No, I'm making time. Here comes another fucker. [They swerve infront of several more cars. Then I sees a police van behind them.]On no. Withnail: It's perfectly alright, leave him to me.You're full of scotch you silly tool. [The police van comes along side them and a policeman leans out pointing markedly to the roadside. Withnail pulls over, the van draws up in front on them and the officers approach the car. One knocks on the window and Withnail winds it down.] P1: Bit early in the morning for festivities isn't it sir? [There is a large pile of bottles on the passenger seat of the car] Withnail: They're not mine, they belong to him. P1: You're drunk. Withnail: I assure you I'm not officer, I've only had a few ales. P1: Out of the car. Please. Sir. [Withnail makes no move so he opens the door. Withnail virtually falls out then stands against the car. The policeman offers him a breathaliser] P1: Would you fill this bag please sir. [Withnail shakes his head] P1: Are you refusing to fill this bag? Withnail: I most certainly am P1: I'm placing you under arrest. Withnail: Don't be ridiculous I haven't done anything. Listen, my cousin's a QC. P2: Get in the back on the van. Police station [Withnail is behind a screen. A sergant is sat at a desk while other policemen wonder around] P3: Serg, what's that clown up to? [The sergent pulls a gap in the screen and sees withnail with the contraption Danny gave him. He grabs the tube and urine splashes everywhere. Withnail grins sheepishly] The flat [Withnail and I enter their flat. They look through the post] Withnail: Where's our checks?We didn't sign on. Withnail: That wouldn't make any difference to last weeks payments. [They hear music from upstairs. The door to the bathroom is ajar and in the bath is a large black man who looks at them inquiringly. I looks in his bedroom. The bed is occupied by Danny]What are you doing in my bed?Who's the huge spade in the bath?Well I want you out. You've got ten minutes alright? Coz I want to get in. The lounge [All four are sat in the lounge] Withnail: How did you get in?No thanks, I've got a call to make. [Danny starts pulling out rizzlers at a prolific rate] Withnail: What are you going to do with those?It's imposible to use 12 papers on one joint.No, I got a different one. They want me to play the lead. Withnail: Congratulations.A trip to the countryside.That is a dog, belongs to the man downstairs.You bloody fool. He'll have us up in court again.Stop laughing will you Withnail, this is serious.What papers?Look, he's got our checks. What are you doing with these?For christ'd sake Withnail, stop laughing will you. Look, this is a notice of eviction Withnail: Give it to my barrister. [Presuming Ed starts chanting and rotating a globe] Ed: Harriramma, HarirammaShup up will you, you're giving me the fear! Give us a downer Danny, I've gone and fucked my brain.Aren't you getting absurdly high?Don't talk about them.Talking to each other? What do you mean?Why've you drugged their onions!?I'm going to eat some sugar.No way, no fucking way.Right, I'm off now. Withnail: Already?My father will pick up my stuff in the week and do something about the car. Withnail: But I've got us a bottle open. Confiscated it from Monte's supplies. 53 Margaux. Best of the centuryI can't Withnail, I'll miss the train. Withnail: There's always time for a drink.I haven't the time. Withnail: Alright, I'll walk with you to the station. We can drink it through the park. [He grabs his coat and an umbrella and takes the bottle.] The Park [It is pouring down with rain. Withnail offer the bottle to I]No thankyou, no more. Look, it's a stinker Withnail, why don't you go home. Withnail: Because I want to walk you to the station.No, really, I really don't want you to. [They stop by the wolves.]I shall miss you Withnail. Withnail: I'll miss you too. [I departs. Withnail walks to the fence and leans against it.] Withnail: I have of late, but wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promotory; this most excellent canopy the air, look you, this mighty o'rehanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire; why, it appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties, how like an angel in aprehension, how like a God! The beauty of the world, paragon of animals; and yet to me, what is this quintessence of dusk. Man delights not me, no, nor women neither, nor women neither.
