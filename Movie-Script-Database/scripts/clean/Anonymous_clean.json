It's a comedy for god's sake! There's nothing seditious about--Because I wrote the bloody thing! And-A pox on you! And your carbuncled father!And who are you?And where are we going?My lord...It looks to me to have quite a number of thorns, my lord.I am told, my lord, that I owe my freedom to you.My lord-- I'm sorry, does that mean my release is not officially sanctioned?Thank you, my lord.Politics? My play had nothing to do with politics! It was just a simple comedy--A play, my lord?Stage?My name, my lord?Yes. My lord. You wrote an entire play, my lord. I know how difficult--And you want... me to apply my name to this play?All of them?My lord-- I really--My lord?Hello? My lord?!

To change the world, not to become someone else's--Yes, why not? Why can't a man change the world with words?\"I can make you the most popular and the richest playwright in all of London.\" Ballocks! I can do that myself, thank you very much.Not half--?! You're an actor, what in God's name do you know about writing?! He's an amateur, Will, a complete and utter amateur.

It would be an affront against the Muses...What, you think my name can be bought, if the number's great enough, do you?My lord, I thought that--My lord, your voice is completely different than mine. My, my, my characters are--All, my lord? Is that possible?It's really not that difficult, if you try.You can't play Romeo.So bloody well act like a writer! And for God's sake, keep off the stage. Writers don't have time to act.Think you so? Have you ever tried?Perhaps they haven't noticed..You informed on one of your own? To the Tower?Why are you here, Kit?You've had too much to drink, Kit.

And I know he was planning to expose you if you didn't agree to his terms.Be careful, Will. You kill me off too, and you won't have any good plays to act in after this is all done.Right!? Not without right? You went to him, didn't you? You lying knave-- you went to him!What? You've already killed off one competitor. Now you want another dead as well?I swore to him I wouldn't tell you his name. Swore it! Do you have any idea what he might do to me? Do you?He's not even a writer you know. He can't even--Unhand me!Here! A quill! A quill!Go on, Will. Write something for us. Now. Go on! Amaze us with your verse. Your wit! No? Try astounding us with the letter \"E\".

Though I'll not pay for the tickets myself. No need to.I... There is a-- there is a play to be performed... on Monday.Yes, my lord, but this one is to be performed one performance, and one performance only. On Monday. All Bankside is talking of it. The History of King Richard the Third. By William Shakespeare.He kills his brother the king, and half the royal family to get the throne for himself--Yes. Of course you do. But in William Shakespeare's version, he is played as a hunch-back.Waiting? Waiting for what?This is what Essex is waiting for-- Oxford is bringing him a mob.I don't know, I don't know! But, the Tower-- Cecil, he already knows. He knows! I-- I have to warn them!Will! Will Shakespeare!So! Off to the palace are you?A command performance for our new king!

All listening to the writings of one man-- the ideas of one man. That's power, Robert. And if there is one thing the Cecils understand, it's power.Essex played rather poorly, didn't he?Henry... The Cecils brook no rivals.I would have you deny him.That is rumor only, Henry--I desire nothing more than to see the next king be the rightful king. But what Essex contemplates will surely lead to Civil War. No. If this is to be done, it must be done carefully, skillfully.I only have your interests in mind, Henry. For as you so rightly point out, my interests are already lost.Henry! Will you do me one thing more? Deliver a gift for me? A rather... elaborate gift?The Tudor rose. The most beautiful of flowers, don't you think?So it does. So it does.That is true. And it was quite hard to come by. One does not cross my father-in-law lightly.Lord William Cecil. I have the questionable distinction of being married to his only daughter.It did, however, serve as helpful when I wrote to your jailers to release you in my father-in-law's name.Don't be an idiot Jonson, of course it wasn't. But you are free, are you not?I enjoyed your little comedy last week, Jonson. You have potential, great potential.But it's politics did seem to have quite an effect on the Tower. My father-in-law's men felt it quite seditious.That showed your betters as fools who go through life barely managing to get food from plate to mouth, were it not for the cleverness of their servants. All art is political, Jonson. Otherwise it would just be decoration. And all artists have something to say, otherwise... they'd make shoes. And you're not a cobbler, are you, Jonson?Francesco.One you shall stage Bankside.Under your name.I can't very well use my name, can I? I'm the seventeenth Earl of Oxford. The Lord Great Chamberlain of England, Viscount Bolebec, Lord Escales, Sandford and Badlesmere, etc, etc. No. I have a... reputation to protect. In my world, one does not write plays, Jonson. People like you do.Not a play, Jonson, I've written many. No doubt, many more than you yourself. A good number performed at Court years ago, others never seen by a living soul.No. I mean you to put your name to all of them.Well don't look like I just gutted your pet dog, Jonson. I mean to make you the most popular-- and therefore the most monetarily successful-- playwright in all of London.I wish you god speed and good morrow.Henry--I can't give it to you.Henry-- Henry!!An actor?!!An actor for god's sake?You presumed to think? On my behalf? Whatever made you believe you had that prerogative?Voice? You have no voice! That's why I chose you! You at least kept my name from him?And will continue to do so?A romantic tragedy.

The sweet longings of a maiden, the, the surging ambitions of a courtier, the foul designs of a murderer, the wretched pleas of his victims.

I will send her a book.She will call for me. And while I am with her, you will come-- not with an army, not with swords, but with her loyal subjects. The cobblers, the tinkers, the bricklayers of London.All, all calling for Robert Cecil's banishment from Court. Words, Robert, words, will prevail with her, not swords.Leave that to me.You shall begin rehearsals immediately. But it is not to be performed until I tell you. And you may only have a day's notice.Oh, and congratulations. You've had an epic poem published today.He wanted his grandson to be an Earl.You lie...Elizabeth would never have--I thank your majesty for seeing me.He is our son.They only wished for a place in government equal to their station. Equal to their birth.Then take my head. In our son's stead.Neither they nor I ever conspired against you. Cecil alone was our aim. He has corrupted your--We would have protected you--Let our child live...He will never learn of it from me.But only after my death! Only then! When all is complete. After James is crowned king, his crown safe, only then can you claim your son... our son. This Island will be whole. pg. 131One Island, one kingdom, one King. Scotsman though he be. That, that will be my final gift to my people. And I shall remain pure... Un-taken!Thank you, doctor.Come over here, Jonson...Did you know, Jonson, that my family can trace its peerage farther back than any family in the kingdom? We fought at Crecy. At Bosworth Field. At Agincourt. I inherited my Earldom as one of the wealthiest men ever to breathe English air... and at last breath, I shall be one of the poorest.Never a voice in government. Never a sword raised in glorious battle. No immortal deeds for my heirs to know me by. Words, merely words, are to be my legacy... You alone watch my plays and know them as mine. When I hear the applause, the cheering, of the audience, all those hands clapping, they are celebrating... another man. But in that cacophony of sounds, I strained to hear the sound of two hands only. Yours. But heard them, I never did.Death takes away all pretense and demands honesty from its target. You, you have never told me... never told me what you thought of my work...Promise me... promise me, Jonson, that you will keep our secret safe. That you won't expose Shakespeare...I have seen it in your face... He vexes you. How could he not? But he is not your burden. He is mine.All my writings. The plays, the sonnets... Keep them safe. Keep them from my family. From the Cecil's. Wait a few years, and then, publish them.I have made it my life to know the character of men, Jonson. I know you.

You don't deny him anything. You find excuses. She is unwell, she is reading, she is seeing the Ambassador from Russia. For God's sake, use your imagination, Robert. Whatever will you do when I am gone? We will have to deal with Essex soon. His ambitions are becoming a nuisance.Now tell me about the play.Of course he did. But what was it about?...And dancing asses?Edward... Have you any idea what you have-- No, how could you...And do you know how long it took me to banish them from her presence? She adores them! Adores them! And Edward knows it. Mark my words, Robert, he has done this for a purpose.What purpose indeed? But through your carelessness I must now deal not only with Essex, but Edward as well. For whether in shadow or in person, Edward has returned to Court!Robert.Robert! Come here.I am sorry, my lord. But my son Robert prefers the company... of himself...May I present my wife, Lady Cecil, and my daughter, Anne.Because the Queen has bade it so. My lord, when we first met, you said you wished to become a great man of State. Both the Queen and I hope to make that so.To that end, I have the honor of introducing you to your tutors. Seven to eight you shall be tutored in French by Mister Crane--Nine to ten is Greek with Mister Simmons.And you know your uncle, Mister Golding, who has petitioned me to allow you to assist him in his translations of ancient Latin texts into English.Then cosmography with Doctor Richards. Two to three is geography and history, and four to five fencing.This is a Puritan home, your grace. We believe such activities to be the worship of false idols, and therefore a sin before the eyes of God.Not in this household.King Philip of Spain sees the current Catholic revolt in Ireland as a weakness of ours. A weakness to be exploited....There are rumors of his sending financial aid, and even troops. We must act quickly. We must replace the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and send additional troops immediately, majesty.I would recommend the Earl of Essex, your majesty.As long as the present crisis warrants, majesty.I only recommend we send your most able subjects where they are most needed, majesty. Philip of Spain dreams still of taking your kingdom from you.Of burning you at the stake as a heretic. Give him a foot-hold in Ireland, and--Essex's martial abilities are, in my opinion, the only antidote to the plague of Philip. Though, Essex would not, unfortunately, be able to remain in the Privy Council if he is in Ireland...Sir Robert Cecil.He is my own advisor first, my son second, majesty. His counsel has been invaluable to me, and no doubt will be to you as well.Murdered!By your own hand!He was doing my bidding!Of course. As soon as Robert informed me that you were disobeying my express--Enough! Thou shalt not worship false idols in my household! Your everlasting soul hangs in the balance. Not poems. Your soul!You have placed me in a grave position, Edward.I cannot have my reputation soiled by this regrettable lack of control on your part... No. I will not have it. We can claim self-defense, he drew sword first. But... I wish something in return.My daughter is young, impressionable. She has feelings for you, Edward. It is to be expected, living in such close quarters...Hold your tongue, Edward, before you make a claim you cannot retract! I have been legally reimbursed for your education and living expenses.No. This is how I suggest you keep your noble head from the executioner's block.Where is her majesty?No, Robert, think. If he is really as popular as you say, we would only anger the mob. No. We must strike at Edward directly.Our authority comes from Elizabeth and from God! Elizabeth! Elizabeth is the key to all.Robert... You must think deeper. You must compensate. Compensate for your... malformations... with the gifts God did grant you... With cunning. With ruthlessness.From King James of Scotland.James knows of the Queen's affection for Essex... and the rumors of his birth. He is justly concerned. You will reply to him.I am dying, Robert-- We both know this to be true. And I will not witness the next coronation.Help me to my bed, my son. If we are to secure your place at the side of the next king, you must get that king his throne, not I.You will write to James that I am gravely ill, but that all is in hand. Much of the Privy Council has already secretly agreed to his ascension to the English throne due to your tireless, but secret, entreaties on his behalf. And then tell him Essex will not return from Ireland alive.This is how kings are made, Robert. So it was with Elizabeth, and so it shall ever be. There were many rival claims to her throne, but none survived to make their claim. James must know that you will do the same for him, and he will reward you for it. But we must do one thing more...Like Essex, Edward must be removed.He uses the tools at his disposal, as we use the tools at ours. But ours will win... as they always have.Edward seeks what we seek. To choose the next King.Are you certain?Marry him, your grace? He is already married.Can you?Most of the Catholic princes of Europe wish to topple you and end your Protestant reign... The only things that stop them are the channel, and the hope that they might marry you, and thereby achieve your realm through other means.Would you risk your throne for him? Would you risk England for him?We must do as we have done before... You must go on Progress, somewhere isolated, accompanied by only those whom you most trust.After the birth, I will find a suitable house for the child to be reared in.He must never know.I am praying.She's on Progress.The Queen does not ask for my advice about matters of the heart, Edward. If she had, she hardly would have chosen you for her pleasure.You must have known her eye would move elsewhere, Edward. It always has. You are neither the first, nor the last, of her lovers.Go back to my daughter, Edward. She will accept you with open arms, as she always has. Behave as your great title demands you behave. Tend to your estates, your investments. And make me a grandson, an heir!I cannot be certain, majesty, when the... relationship began.But sometime soon after your return to Court.They-- they haven't been very discreet, majesty. I presume he wanted you to know. To... to hurt you.Majesty, there is more. The lady is pregnant.Your whore gave birth last week.The Queen has decided to release you. It seems time does indeed heal all wounds. These are her conditions for your release. One. You will not acknowledge the child. Two. You will never see the mother again. Three. You will avoid Court at all costs. Her majesty would prefer not to be reminded of you in any way ever again.No. You have the freedom of the kingdom. Just not of the Court. Those are her terms. Here are mine. You will go back to my daughter. You will make some effort to make her happy and you will finally act according to your station in life, and accept the responsibilities of your great title.I don't know if the whore has even delivered the--The other one?
