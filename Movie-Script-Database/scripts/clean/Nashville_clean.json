How's she doing?Well, I just thought I'd call.I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.May I see your costume?Sueleen, you're prettier and probably sing better. Besides, she is unusually sick. And tonight you have the opportunity to work in front of some grateful gentlemen.Have you ever done this before?Well, it's not too hard. You'll sing whatever it is you want to sing. They'll applaud like crazy 'cause I can tell them that you're really something and then the piano and drum will give you a little fanfare and you can sing and take off your clothes or not sing. It really doesn't make much difference, really. But since you've never done this before, singing might help.Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.I know that you are an artist and I am sure you are very religious.Well, this is for people who have a kind of religious belief in the way they live.Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven.I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.Well, it's probably because it would help him.Everybody likes to be as good as their word.His Word.That's pretty close. He's going to be on the bill. Why not put Barbara Jean on with him?Come on, come on. You don't want to waste your energy on that fool.We could invite them to the park.They can come to the concert in the park.Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.Nothing; Barnett.

Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?Your job, huh.She will not appear on the stage or support that Walker guy and you can't have any of his signs up while she sings. She'll be on first and out of the park before he shows up. There will be no pictures, no questions, no answers or tying her name up with his now or in the future to come. Any money she makes will go to the President of the United States.We'll see you tomorrow. I'll send her three songs over this afternoon.
