{"Rust-and-Bone": {"ALI": {"raw_line": "It's me. It's Ali... I left. I took the kid with me. She can't take care of him anymore. I got into a fight with the guy she's with. I don't know where to go. What do I do with the kid? I can't talk. I don't have any more credit... Call me back! He hangs up quickly and turns to Sam.Move it! His phone rings. He immediately answers.Yeah! Where is it? Shit! It's so far! How do I get there? I don't know. Today or tomorrow. Yeah... Ali lifts Sam onto his shoulders with one arm. Sam is tiny, he looks like a squirrel on his father's back.We don't have any money.Stop it. Sam's Mickey Mouse sandals pause, then go back to their banging.I said to stop it. The sandals freeze. Cut.I don't know. A big street that started at the station. Yeah, by the beach. Behind? We just came from there! Ali pulls Sam away from one of the stairways that lead to the beach...So am I. He's coming to pick us up. Come on! Sam is extenuated. Ali has to heave him up onto a shoulder.You kidding?She didn't remember anything. It was already in there. She forgot about it, that's all. When they went to Amsterdam, they'd use the kid to smuggle dope...That's what she told me. Anna shakes her head in disbelief. A beat.I don't know.Um, no. You in school? No answer. Sam is watching TV.Yeah.It's not too much, but I don't have it. I had to pay for the train...I don't know. Find a job. Whatever.What should I have done with the kid? Where should I have gone?I don't know. She makes a tired gesture and goes back toward the house, calling Richard on the way. Ali hears Sam in the kennel, giggling in delight. He looks around: the seedy garden, a metal shed leaning to one side, what's left of an engine, an old, orange Special 50 moped, plastic junk, etc. Overhead, a plane descends on Nice, its landing lights shining.Unzip it yourself! Ali struggles free and smiles at the guy invitingly. The guard tries to punch him. Ali dodges: The guard hesitates a moment, until Ali lets fly a right hook. The guard stumbles. A kick in the face sends him flying into a stall. Ali lifts his arms in victory for the benefit of the few, stunned passersby. He kisses his own biceps, does three steps of a moonwalk and saunters off.Hey! Here I am! Ali crosses the street and kneels down in front of Sam who is sniffling, tears in his eyes.No need to cry. I wouldn't have left you all alone. Ali unlocks the moped.Are you happy here? Sam nods.What do you like the most at Auntie's?Is that all? Nothing else besides the dogs?The dogs and the truck. The house? Auntie? The ocean?We have it good here... Ali's fingers stop. Sam looks up to find his father watching some girls in swimsuits go by. They go for a swim, horsing around and making noise.No. The boss is in his fifties. He sits behind some files. His hair is short and white, it looks like he's wearing a helmet. He is squeezed into a cheap suit and wearing a tie. He stares at Ali.I worked in a slaughterhouse. Not for long. It closed.Yeah. I was a night watchman in a stadium for 6 months. Working for the city. In a parking lot too. I did replacements.Karate, for 6 years. I even won Junior Division. And two years of boxing. Thai.It was my trainer who gave up.He died. A beat.Yeah.No.And it works?Are you okay? Breathe out of your mouth. In and out. Put your head back. Walk a little. Walk and breathe... He demonstrates how and takes her by the arm, forcing her to walk. She looks groggy.You have friends here?You can't drive like that.You can't drive like that. I'll call you a cab.Where's your car?Still bleeding? Keep your head back. Wait... He manipulates the knob to push her seat back. He grimaces in pain.Shit!You often go to the Fever?Why do you go alone? No answer.To dance?To find a guy? She turns and looks down her nose at him:You're dressed like that just for dancing?I don't know... Look. He points to her skirt, riding up her thighs.You look like a hooker.How would you call it?What?Dressed like that, it's no surprise that...I don't know. She takes out her wallet.No, stop!Don't worry. Got any ice at your place? He shows her his wrist.Ice cubes.I can come up.So what?... Ali.Ice cubes.Is that you in the picture with the orcas?Is that your job?Fuck... I didn't think that...You talking to me? It's as if Ali's calm, peremptory tone suddenly let Simon know who he was dealing with.But what?Okay, I'm going. So long. I left you my number if ever you need it...Sam! No answer. There is some noise over at the kennel. He goes and finds Sam in the kennel, talking to the puppies.What are you doing here?You're gross! You stink! Who's taking care of you? Ali drags him over to the garage to hose him down. The water is freezing cold. Sam hops from one foot to the other and screams.Aren't you supposed to be taking care of him? What the fuck are you up to?Take a look at him!Don't go in there. It's disgusting. You hear? Joelle takes Sam and disappears inside. Ali is drawn to the living room, when through the half-open door he notices the flat screen turned onto a news channel. Onscreen and behind the anchorwoman, he recognizes an inset photo of Stephanie, the same he saw at her place, riding on the back of a killer whale. \u00ef\u0080\u0081\u00ef\u0080\u0082\u00ef\u0080\u0083\u00ef\u0080\u0083\u00ef\u0080\u0084\u00ef\u0080 \u00ef\u0080\u0086\u00ef\u0080\u0087\u00ef\u0080\u0088\u00ef\u0080\u0089\u00ef\u0080\u0084\u00ef\u0080\u008a\u00ef\u0080\u008b\u00ef\u0080\u008c\u00ef\u0080\u008d\u00ef\u0080\u008e\u00ef\u0080\u008f\u00ef\u0080\u008f\u00ef\u0080\u0088\u00ef\u0080\u0090\u00ef\u0080\u0084\u00ef\u0080\u0091\u00ef\u0080\u0092\u00ef\u0080\u008a\u00ef\u0080\u0093\u00ef\u0080\u008a Il manque une phraseI know her. Sam pulls off his towel. He watches his father who is riveted to the screen, glued to the looping footage of the accident.What do you want?Hey, Kadhi, come here! Kadhi comes over and looks at the guy.Who's he?Will this do?Fire them.A stroll?Okay, then I'll be getting back.It's fine.Hello?Yeah... How are you doing? She sniggers. Her speech sounds slow and thick.Yeah... I saw the papers\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the news on TV\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 How are you?Okay... normal.No, not really.Yeah, but nights are tough. I'm a security guard now. Three nights a week.Huh?No... I just got here.No.Yes.That's fine. It takes two tries to activate the wheels on her wheelchair.Need any help? She answers with a growl, as much for him as for her wheelchair, then goes into the kitchen. He sees her pajama legs flap like rags, he hears the noise of the tap.Have you been living here long?... It's nice. She comes back.Are you alone? You got no one to help you?No, for the cleaning and everything...Hey, are you okay?Yeah, a little.Let's go out. Hey, you hear me?Let's go out.Get dressed.Where are your clothes? He opens the closet.Here. Ali hands her a pair of sunglasses.Where should we go?Should we go to the ocean?I want to go in.I feel like swimming!You don't want to?You don't feel like swimming? She looks daggers at him.You don't have a bathing suit?Who the fuck cares? There's no one here!... How, like this?You okay?So?You swim like a real pro!... She shuts her eyes.Huh?I'm still at the gym. I'm leaving... I said I'm leaving! He hangs up. They continue.Yeah.There's something I don't get: how much do you take?And how much does your cousin give you?Okay. The cousin stands up. They all shake on it.Yeah, I heard. He gets up and goes to get Sam who is playing behind the house. Anna finds her papers and leaves in another direction.Sam! Come here! I want to show you some stuff! He lifts Sam up with one arm and goes back to the computer.Look how they fight... He clicks on an image and the fight continues... the audience's noise as well. Sam watches, intrigued. AliLook at him, in red. See how strong he is?No, he's the bad guy. Look how he tries to grab his legs. Wait. His phone vibrates. He takes it from his pocket. It's Martial. He answers.Hello? Yeah...I don't know. Look and tell me who wins. He turns down the sound, settles Sam on the stool and gets up to go speak.So? What did he say? Which others? How many? Sam watches the fight in silence. Dogs bark in the garden. Sam feels something coming. He looks out the window, then goes running. Ali hasn't noticed a thing and continues his phone conversation.What is this bullshit? What do you mean, a tournament?Tell him to give the website to his mother. All I see is me doing more fights and him making more dough. Ali goes to the window. Outside, near the kennel, Sam has lunged at a guy in a jumpsuit who is helping Anna get the puppies into a metal cage. Sam is screaming. Anna tries to take him into her arms. Sam clutches the bars of the cage. The puppies bark. Anna finally manages to rip Sam free and drag him back into the house.He's changing the rules and so am I... I couldn't care less. Anna storms into the living room. Sam is shrieking, having a tantrum. He kicks and bites.I'm on the phone!I'll call you back. Ali hangs up.You're such a pain in the ass.Stop it now! I said stop! Calm the fuck down!Cut it out, dammit! You're such a pain! He flings the child away. Sam's head hits the coffee table. Silence. Anna rushes over and picks up Sam, who has stopped crying. He's been knocked out. Anna is frightened. She examines his scalp, she strokes his head. She trembles. A cut on his head begins to bleed. She kisses the wound. Ali comes over, upset.No, just fists I think. We bash each other's faces and whoever's still standing at the end wins. Hey, you're strangling me! He puts her down on her chair.Yeah.Of what?I don't know. About 500, 1000 maybe.Um, yeah.Risk my health? What are you talking about? Why are you getting so worked up?You can give it to me if you have too much money, but I said I was doing it and I am. That's all.I didn't say it's not for the money!Oh, stop driving me crazy! I'm doing it to fight. For fun. Why did you clown around on your fish? For the fun of it, right? She grins.Spare me. You turn on the waterworks when you feel like it.Mm?Motherfucker's acting like he's on Canal Plus.I don't know. Guys with money. Dealers. A beat.Great. Martial comes back with a wad of banknotes and slides into the passenger seat.Okay. And the bets? How much is there?I have to go. Another combat begins, while Ali jogs around the hangar. Stephanie watches other combats, whether featuring Ali or not.You liked it.Me too. He again lowers his head.Pull over here. I'll go rinse off my face. Give me 50. Martial uses his turn signal.For my kid.Yep.Cut the shit. He's not dead. I didn't do it on purpose. I'm sorry about it. Anna avoids his glance. He rummages in his pocket, pulls out the envelope of money and hands it to her.Here.Money. What I owe you plus the next fewI won a fight.Hey, will you take the money or not? Why are you looking at me that way?You like it? Sam continues to play, ignoring him. Behind them, Richard is folding up parasols with the help of Che, a bearded neighbor who is also there with all his family.Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.You want to go for a swim?Give me a kiss.Give Daddy a kiss!Give Daddy a kiss!They told me 429. Martial motions him in.I need to find a coach. A real one. Someone who has me work on my takedowns.Foued doesn't know jackshit. Just jiu-jitsu and rap stuff. You need to ask Cousin. His guys must train somewhere.Yeah. And I'll need some time to train.Work it out how?Where's that?Where are you? I can't see you. Where? He looks every which way until he sees her, a few feet away. She is standing upright, in a light pair of pants, with her canes hidden behind her back. It takes some time to register. She smiles at him.That's fucking amazing! I was looking for a wheelchair...Since when?You could have told me!No, I don't know. You're like before.Go on, let's see. She takes a few steps forward, leaning on her canes. He whistles in admiration.It must be like walking on stilts...You look taller. Does it hurt?Want to go for a swim? She stops.Is this all you have?You don't have any pate?I'm hungry. He begins with the cheese.No bread?Yes, but they're not girlfriends.Yeah. She hesitates.No, I don't care. How about you? Did you have a lot of boyfriends?Yeah.That's all?And now?You don't want to?How do you go about it?You want to fuck? She is thrown for a loop.You want to know if it still works, so let's fuck and that way you'll know. He looks at her, simply, naturally. She has a nervous laugh.Um, yeah. Give me that. He takes the plates, gets up and puts them in the dishwasher.Whatever you want... You tell me... She hesitates.What do I do?Okay? Ready? Unsure of herself, she pulls a face.No. Your breasts... can I?Maybe you should stop talking now...Are you okay? How was it? She blushes.Is it still working?Yeah but I don't have time right now. I have to go!But did you enjoy it or not?When you're up for it and you can't find anyone, ask me. If I'm oper, we'll do it.Operational... If I'm available. If I can, I mean!Yeah. She sketches a vague gesture.What? Her throat is constricted, she is unable to answer.Shit!I was talking?I'm with a friend.She's a friend, I said. Just then, the basement door opens and Stephanie appears on her crutches. Anna is dismayed. Ali motions to Stephanie:Let me introduce you to my sister! This is Stephanie. You know the girl from Marineland. Stephanie offers her hand to Anna who takes it, then realizing what she's doing, puts the other to her mouth:You don't want to get going?You freak her out. Can't you see? She feels like a cashier with you. Pathetic with her tea and cookies. It's a pain. Stephanie leans on a cane to stand up.What are you doing?No need to overdo it.... All of a sudden, in your mouth, it's like it tasted like bone. A taste of rust and bone.Yeah, there I did. Then, through the spectators' legs, he sees something: sunlight reflected off the Mercedes door that has just opened on a pair of shoes attached to two prostheses, a pair of shorts\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 He also sees the heads of the tough guys who turn back to look. He breaks free, struggles to his feet, spits up a clot of blood and returns to the task at hand. His opponent tries to get up. Ali jumps on him to finishPacking up.No. He notices that she's taken out her cell phone to take a picture.Don't you take a picture!I said no picture!I'm going to slap you! A hand grabs his arm. It's Martial.And the equipment?Want to boogie? She doesn't understand.You want to dance?Come on!Whatever you say. He goes to the dance floor and begins to rock. He dances badly, clumsily. Martial pours champagne.You okay?Did you stay late?Normal. A large coffee with milk and bread with butter! A beat.What conversation?What do you want me to say?Oh la!Nothing.You're pissing me off. What's your problem?How am I looking at you? The waiter arrives with Ali's order. She tones her voice down a notch.What are you talking about, fucking or fighting?Manners?I'm oper now.You made me oper. It's you! It's because it's all you're talking about!I'm getting out of here.I'm fed up.Yeah.Yeah.Aren't you being an ass by putting words everywhere? He sits back down. She watches him eat his sandwiches.So are you going to Strasbourg?And when are you leaving? Leonardini enters the locker room.Pleased to meet you.How much is there?Where are you?What are you doing?Is it early?Shit, I collapsed... Ali slips out of bed, naked, yawning and groggy. He comes and leans over her...Hold on. She hangs onto his neck. He lifts her up and, both naked, he carries her into the bathroom.Yeah. And when do I see him?Huh?Mm.No. They look at each other. He puts her down on the bed and lies down next to her. Stephanie slides over to him. He lifts her up and places her on her stomach. They remain like that, without moving. She looks like a mermaid lolling on a rock. She leans over and kisses him on the mouth. He pulls away, surprised.Now we're allowed? No answer. They make love. In CU: the tattoo on Stephanie's left thigh. A red and black arrow with, in industrial characters: \"LEFT\".You okay? No answer.You don't seem it. He goes to open the fridge.I'm hungry.What the hell is going on?Shit... But what's the problem if I eat here? Anna stands up.I couldn't know...Looks like you changed trucks!How are things there?My sister?Does she know about today?Tell her I can't help out for the time being but that as soon as I have a little money...Next month. On the 9th. Richard smiles admiringly.Sure I will.Okay.They're not skating. They're skiing.They're skiing, I said!Skiing.Does Auntie still have dogs?In the garden?That's good.She's right. They're disgusting. Finished? You want someYou can go. But not too far! Sam starts slipping and sliding. He falls down. He lies on the sled and lets it glide. Ali pees behind a tree. Sam is far away.Come on, we have to head back!Now!5 minutes. And then suddenly, instead of gliding, the child sinks. He tries to climb out and sinks again. A thin layer of ice is forming over him.Shit! Ali rushes to the pond, but Sam is already iced over. He kneels down and then crawls on his stomach toward the hole. Sam has disappeared. Ali shoves aside snow. He looks everywhere, but sees nothing. And then he hears a noise, blows like signals coming from under the ice. Ali crawlsAnna? Richard shakes his head.Hello?No.Okay. He woke up an hour ago.No, I don't think so.I fucked up my hands on the ice.They're broken. A beat.How are you?What are you up to?I wanted to say that...Don't hang up.Don't hang up!He was in a coma for 3 hours... Three hours... For three hours he was dead... I was scared to lose him. His eyes well with tears.Don't leave me.I love you.Wake up, kiddo. It's over.

I have my car in the lot. I'll be fine.I'm fine. I'm fine, I said. Thanks.How do I get my car afterwards? Seriously, I'll be fine. Trust me! We hear a voice from the parking lot.Shit.Did you hurt yourself? He shows her his right wrist.It's swelling up. He rests his hand on the wheel. After a beat:No.Yes.Oh yeah?How am I dressed?Yeah, so what?Excuse me?I don't believe this. Pull over here!Stop this car on the double!It's MY car! If I tell you to stop, you stop! Still no reaction, as if she hadn't said a thing. She is about to scream again, but remains silent, although open- mouthed. She finally settles back down on the back of her seat and looks elsewhere. A beat.That's enough now! They ride in silence.How will you get back?For a taxi.Wait, I'll go check.No! Even she is surprised by the brusqueness of her response.Someone's up there.Wait here. I'll be right back. She takes a few steps, fumbling for her keys. She hesitates, then looks back.Okay, come on up.Nothing. A fight...Yeah, I'm fine.The bouncer from the Fever. He drove me home.He hurt his hand... Simon pulls Stephanie into the bedroom. Ice cubes in a Plexiglas salad bowl. Ali's hand in the bowl. He looks around. There are photos on the wall: Stephanie surfing on the back of a killer whale, Stephanie posing with a group of young people in diving suits in front of the Marineland logo, Stephanie rising out of the water on Niska's rostrum, etc. From the nearby bedroom, he hears snatches of Simon'sPhilippe and Christine.We decided to go out for a drink after.Feeling better?Not orcas. Just one orca. Her name is Niska.Yep... Ali nods vaguely admiringly.That what? A whore could train whales? Well, you see... Simon is at the door. He is wearing a jean.No, I'm not upset. She drinks the aspirin.I saw your face before...With that guy who dropped me off. I saw your face. I saw how you piped down.Yes, you piped down... Don't tell me what I should do, how I should live my life. Don't give me any more orders, Simon.Don't give me any more orders, that's all. She turns on the faucet and runs her lips under the water.No, Louise, there are lots of things you can say but not that. The pools are my responsibility and all I care about are the animals. I have to see to their environment and that starts with their trainers. Do you understand?No, listen.You're not consistent. We've already discussed that. The foundation of the relationship with the orcas is stability. During your internship you've had your ups and downs. It's not your competence that...Oh, please...Okay, are you done? We can stop here. No need to spoil the rest of your internship. Louise stands up.What... What happened?Stop it, calm down. I'm fine! Her hand searches for something at thigh level, without finding it. She faints.My legs! What did you do with my legs? Two nurses arrive. Stephanie is back in bed, the IVs in her arms. Louise rocks her gently. Stephanie's eyes struggle against sleep. She wants to scream again, but doesn't have the strength. SheReally? Mourning who?Mourning my legs?Yeah, it's really symbolic...No, it's the grass. I'll stop... She laughs so hard she cries.It's Stephanie. Remember me? We met at the Fever. Ali is taken by surprise.You know what happened to me?How do you think I am? A beat. Ali is at a loss to answer.How are you?Still a bouncer?You want to get together?I'm... crazy busy too. Every day and every night. I don't know how to manage... A beat.Now.Come now.Come in. She is waiting in her wheelchair, holding the remote control. She activates it and the door closes behind Ali. Her hair is mid-length, her face has thickened and there are bags under her eyes. She is wearing a baggy Nike T- shirt with burn marks here and there and a pajama bottom whose legs hang limp.Have you been waiting long?Was that you who rang before? She looks exhausted but feverish.Come in. Sit down. He sits down on a small couch.Want something to drink? A coffee?I only have instant.I don't know... Three or four months.Help me what? Walk?Yeah there are people. They come and go. Hold on. She manages to navigate from the living room into her bedroom. He stays in the living room. He hears a kettle whistle in the kitchen. He goes into the kitchen and pours water into the glass/mug. He finds her hunched over in herI'm fine. He opens the window.Does it stink here?It's me. He opens the curtains and looks outside. It is getting hot out. The automatic sprinklers have gone on.Yes.No.Leave me alone.I don't know. You're the one who wanted to go out...I don't care. He tries to push the wheelchair, but she stops him:Stop it. I want to puke. He notices that his moped is attached in the middle of a sprinkler area. He goes to free it and gets splashed... Heavy chain, padlock... he comes back with soiled hands. When he comes back, she's gone. He sees the wheelchair moving toward the seafront avenue. He goes to join her.Go ahead.Huh?Do you realize what you're saying?Forget it. He wavers a moment, then finally crosses the seafront avenue.Actually I think I will go in. He looks at her. She covers herself with a towel and wiggles out of her pants, revealing what remains of her legs. Her stumps are white, with terrible scars at their extremities.You have to carry me. Help me...Yes. He lifts her up and carries her to the water. He takes her far enough in until she begins to float.Don't let me go! Not right away... Do it gently. She feels unsure of herself. He lets go of her gradually. She starts to sink, then crawls forward, with power and grace. She stops but has to paddle like a dog to tread water. He joins her. She grabs onto him.I can't stop. If I do, I sink. Wait... She gesticulates...This is bothering me! She takes off her T-shirt and hands it to him. Her breasts press against Ali's chest.Okay, you can let go. She lets herself go and crawls like a pro. He stays put, holding her t-shirt. Twenty-five meters later, her head emerges. He hears a burst of laughter. Half asleep in a deck chair, he looks up from time to time to see how she's doing. She calls out to him. She is sitting in the water. She motions for him to come and get her. He helps her out and takes her into his arms. She hangs on to him, still out of breath.Fuck that's good! The beach is crowded now. Ali carries her back to the deck chairs. Some bathers watch them go by, others look away. They are stretched out in their chairs. She has wrapped her lower body in a beach towel. They sunbathe.Thanks.Thanks.I'm in here! Louise puts the mail on the living room table and enters the bedroom. Stephanie wheels herself out of the bathroom, her hair wet and her body wrapped in a towel.It's fine!Let go of me! Stop, I can manage alone.I can do the seat belt! In front of the open trunk, Louise struggles to fold the wheelchair.Don't you have something simpler, classier?I don't know... like a wooden leg with a piece of rubber at the end?Or just a plank. A plank with wheels and straps. And irons to move forward with.What? If I want...Come on...Go if you want\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I'll take a taxi.And that works? If you tell them you're with me, do they let you do what you want?Cool. If ever you want a day off, just tell me. I'll write you a note. Louise looks at her. She's not going to let her get on her nerves. There is a knock at the door. A nurse enters. She checks the resin bands, looks at her watch.What kind of boxing? Thai? Do you use your feet?Is it the first time you're doing this?And you're not scared?How much do they pay you for this?You're doing that for 500 euros?You're going to get whacked on the face and risk your health for 500 euros?I'll give you the 500! Cancel it and I'll give it to you tomorrow.If it's not for money, why then?Why are you doing it?Yeah and look how I ended up.Your fight, if you do it...You think I can come along?Who are the other guys?You okay?What do I do?It's nothing, just a cut. Got anything to disinfect it with?Keep this on it. It's the only one I have. Ali looks up at her.Yes.Put this on it. It's the only one I have. Ali straightens up, covers himself with the towel and remains like that: invisible, out of breath, clearing his throat and spitting out the window... Stephanie observes the welts on his body. A big service station appears a bit farther down the road. Ali sits back up.No, not very. Alone in the back seat, Stephanie looks out at the service station.What do you want to know? If I knew him before the accident? Martial looks back.You find it weird that we're together? You wonder what he's doing with me?No. Martial finishes counting the bills.Why are you giving me that?Exactly. So why give it to me? He looks at her, suddenly surprised.You have a kid?Stop looking. No more wheelchairs!Two days.Why? Is it a problem?Well, not exactly.I need to get my balance but supposedly that doesn't take long.I don't know. I've never walked on stilts before.A little, but it feels good too.The beach... pff, I don't know... It's different today... I don't think I want to get undressed.Look in the fridge. There must be some cheese left.No, I don't have any pate. He gets up and opens the fridge. He takes the cheese, sniffs it, then takes some yoghurt too. He notices a box of cereal on a shelf and takes it. He returns to the fridge for some milk. She watches, her mouth open in suspense.You're a good eater, aren't you?There are crackers up there. Do you have a girlfriend? He shakes his head.You don't have anyone?What are they? Quick fucks?A lot? He looks at her.You mind talking about this?When, before?I was with Simon...No, there were others. But not a lot either. I... I wasn't very... In fact, I liked it when guys looked at me... I liked to feel that I turned them on... Afterwards, I don't know... they bored me. Ali looks at her, strangely attentive, as if he didn't understand, or didn't believe her.Um, nothing. I don't even know what it looks like anymore... I don't even know if it still works...Did I say I didn't want to anymore? Of course I still want to...How do you think I go about it? If I were a guy I'd say I jerk off to a porn video... I'm a girl. Ali is dumbstruck.Okay, let's change the subject... She begins piling up plates and silverware.Huh?Just like that?I... I don't know if I can like that...Wait. She wheels herself away from the table and into the bedroom. He remains alone, quickly cleaning the table.Wait! He waits. Then:Come here.Let's try. He slips under the covers, spontaneously tries to kiss her, but she pushes him away gently.Do you mind if we don't kiss?Yes. He licks her breasts, then lies on top of her, covering her. She tries to wriggle herself free.You're crushing me!Okay, I'll stop. His hands caress her, they grab onto what remains of her thighs. He enters her. She is about to scream, but lets herself go. She grabs hold of him.Gently!Um, yes... no... I don't really know. It's different... It's hard to tell after just one try...No, no! That's not what I meant... I just meant that it's too soon to tell... like too many things are happening at once... Ali doesn't understand.I did. A beat.What's \"oper\"?If you're \"oper\" we...Nothing. Great.Louise? Louise, are you here? Is anyone here? No answer. She looks over the office she once knew so well and that hasn't seen again since her accident: the photos on the wall, the diagrams, the case histories, the animals' names, etc...I stopped by the office but there wasn't anyone. Stephanie stands up with the help of her canes. The guys rush over to help her. They hug and kiss. All four remain like that for a moment.When I feel like it, I send him a text message and ask if he's oper. If he is, we hook up. Louise reacts.If he's up for it. If he's free. If he is, we fuck.Yes, that's all. What else do you want?For me it is.He fights.No. Illicit fights in the projects. Louise reacts.Whatever I say, you make a face.He does me good.Who is it? He looks for his clothes...So that's him? They are sitting around the garden table. Anna comes carrying a tray.Don't bother. This is perfect, I swear. Thanks. Before Stephanie can even finish, Anna is already on the way back to the kitchen.So this is where you sleep? It's a nice room. Sam nods in agreement. He gives her a strange look.Why are you looking at me like that? Does it scare you? You want to see them, is that it? He nods. She lifts one of her pant legs to show the prosthesis underneath. Sam looks attentively, stretches out his hand, touches it carefully.No... Want to touch it? Sam reaches out his hand.Here. He applies it to his eyebrow. She displaces a bloody strand of hair and replaces it with another. We see Martial return to the car and open the front door.Because you think bone has a taste?Is he okay with that?Why me?Yes, sure but.... I don't know anything about that scene... I don't know those guys! He hands her an old spiral notebook.How do I do the bets?Honestly, can you see me dealing with those beasts?No. A shadow crosses Stephanie's mind. She looks at the open bags and suitcases, without really seeing them. The place looks like it's expecting a police raid.Where are you going?Austria?Was the insurance money your idea?No, no!Yes?Yeah... where else would it be?Why would they do that?No. And I don't want anything to happen to it. Now more than ever! He looks at her, incredulous, but with admiration.Do I sound like that?Huh? I can't hear you...Champagne? The guy orders. He is blond, lean and athletic-looking. He might be thought to resemble Simon.Hey there. I'm Marie.No... No, please. I don't feel like it. Not tonight. I can't... The guy looks disappointed, then manages a \u00e2\u0080\u0098good loser's' smile.It's best I go. Good night and thanks.You couldn't know what?You couldn't know what, asshole? Foued runs to warn Martial, Khadi and Cousin that something is wrong. When Martial arrives, he sees Stephanie collared by a bouncer three times her size. She lashes out with one of her canes, while under the bar, another bouncer tries to help the blond guy back to his feet. There's a deep gash on his skull. Cousin comes to give the bouncer a hand.Fine.I can't remember. Afterwards the cousin took us to a club at la Colle sur Loup... It sucked and it was 5 a.m. And you?You think it's good that we're having this conversation?That I ask how it was with the girl last night and you answer normal.Nothing. He grimaces at her mood.\"Oh la\" what? You think it's normal leaving with that bimbo in front of me? What would you say if I did the same thing?Oh yeah? You wouldn't care?Wait, let me put it differently. What I am for you? A friend? A pal? Sort of a buddy, like Foued and the others?Tell me something: do you and your buddies fuck every now and then? He snickers.No? Really? Never? That's the difference. Her looks at her.Dammit, stop looking at me that way!You wanted us to continue... Isn't that what you told Martial?Well, we have to go about it well. We have to show each other manners, and consideration...Hey! Stop acting like an idiot. Do the words bother you? You know what I mean.... Tact... You've never stopped being tactful with me. A beat. He looks away.So... is that a plan? She waits for his mind to come back before continuing.We'll continue... but not like animals. He smirks, with a flick of the chin.Cat got your tongue? Ali stirs his cup without answering. He feels her eyes on him. He smiles.What?You are really a dog. He stands up.What are you doing?Why?You're bored?What I'm saying bores you?Are you acting like a jackass on purpose?I'm the one who's leaving. She gets up. Ali finishes his coffee.3400. Are you ready? Walking with a slow, deliberate sway - aware of the effect she's having - she ceremonially opens the passenger door. The remarks cease.Here. He sits up. She is embarrassed.No, don't look!I'm going to pee.Five.I don't like it when you see me like this...I called the numbers they gave me at the gym. I spoke to an organizer, G\u00c3\u00bcnther Bower. She yawns.There's a gala in Turin next week. He told me that we'd have time to meet there. I'm going to go.Later, in his gym in Dortmund. He wants to organize a test match, to see what you're worth. To see if you've got the \"G\u00c3\u00b6ttlicher Zorn\"\"... Ali comes out of the shower.Turn on the water.Turn on the water when you pee. It's disgusting. He runs some water.How's your nose?It doesn't seem broken.Mr. Bower?I'm Stephanie Granget. G\u00c3\u00bcnther looks about fifty and has obviously spent many of those years in the ring.Can you get me a ticket for tonight?An accident. In another life. I was an animal trainer. I worked with orcas... The show took a turn for the worse.Why?Of course, Mr. Bower.What? That?So do I. He draws her inside. The door closes.Yeah. They don't know.Yes.You don't know him.I don't know. Not this. Fade to black. Black.It's me. Do you mind?How is he?Is he injured?And how are you?Is it serious?I'm okay.You mean in general? In my life?I'm not asking for anything. I'll be going. I'll call you back to see how Sam's doing. Give him a kiss him from me...I won't hang up...I won't leave you.
