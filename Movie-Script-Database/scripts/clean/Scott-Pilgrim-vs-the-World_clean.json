{"Scott-Pilgrim-vs-the-World": {"SCOTT": {"raw_line": "I'm not playing your little games.I'm twenty-two. Twenty-two!We have done many things. We ride the bus. We have meaningful conversations about how yearbook club went and about her friends and, um...you know...drama.We almost held hands once, but then she got embarrassed.Knives Chau. She's Chinese.I believe I mentioned the bus? Scott Pilgrim prepares to tell an amazing story:Hey... Knives looks up to see the cute and gallant SCOTT PILGRIM holding her books. TEXT appears in an on-screen box:Yes. It is. Young Neil unpauses his Nintendo DS.That's for me.You promise to be good?No, really. Please be good.Oh, hey. Knives, this is Stephen Stills. He's the talent.She'll just sit in the corner, man.She'll geek. She geeks. She has the capacity to geek.Knives, that's Kim. Lemme get your coat. Scott throws Knives' coat on the floor. Knives waves.Knives, that's Young Neil.Let's start with Launchpad McQuack.Yeaaah.Yeaaah.Yeaaah...wait, what?Like, do I have ulterior motives or something? I'm offended, Kim.Hurt, Kim.Neil, you were saying she seems awesome.Yeaaaah...Before you hear some dirty lies from someone else, yes, I'm dating a 17 year old. Wallace looks up from the NOW magazine he's reading.Ha, ha, ha, ha.Do you see another bed in here? TINY BOXES OF TEXT indicate the ownership of the items in the one room flat: 95% belongs to Wallace, FUTON included.So. The whole seventeen year old thing. Don't tell too many people.I mean. Don't tell my sister.Who are you texting? RINGY RING. The phone goes. Scott picks up.That's not true. Who told you?That gossipy bitch.Wallace! Wallace clicks off. Scott sinks into an armchair.Her name is Knives. Knives Chau.It's a Catholic school too.Yeah, the whole deal.No no no. We haven't even held hands. I think she hugged me once.I don't know...it's just nice, you know? It's just...simple.Can I get back to you on that? A SCHOOL BELL clangs loudly...This school has boys too.Well, she's only allowed out when the sun is up, so I wouldn't call it dating, more like...That doesn't sound so good either.Hey Knives, this is my cool gay roommate, Wallace Wells. He's gay.Wallace, you go now! Begone! Wallace pulls Knives close. Whispers.Did you know the original name of Pac- man was Puck-man? You would think it's because Pac-Man looks like a yellow hockey puck, but actually it comes from the Japanese phrase paku-paku which means to flap ones mouth open and closed. They changed it over here because Puck-Man is too easy to vandalize. You know, scratch out the P and turn it into an F or whatever? Knives flips over Scott's back in a COMBO move.Yeah. Wow. The game ends. CONTINUE appears, counting down: 10...9...8... Scott looks at Knives. She digs for quarters.I thought Derek and Tamara had a mutual like-each-other thing going, what happened?I knew I personally rocked, but I never suspected that we rocked as a unit. Thank you, Knives.Well, we're already pretty big. But it might be cool if cool people wore our T-shirt. Knives speaks to a female clerk, surly with tats and specs:Thank you, Julie.Thank you, Julie.And you definitely don't want to listen to them. Scott puts The Clash at Demonhead CD back in the rack.I hearted them too until they signed to a major label and the singer turned into a total bitch and ruined my life. But that's just me.Sorry, you were saying about me?You go out with a lot of guys?Yeah, so whatever, man!Me neither.My secret lair is one of those 'no girls allowed' deals.But do you want to see the house where I grew up?Here you go.Yeah. Wow. Wind blows. The light snowfall turns into sand...Oh God...so...so alone. A MYSTERIOUS GIRL rollerblades across the shifting sands. She wears fishnets, an army jacket, skirt and goggles. Her pink hair is funky but cool. She is hotter than the desert sun.Does that mean we can make out? But she's gone...Oh God... Wallace wakes up to the left of Scott, rubbing his eyes.I had this totally weird dream.But there was this girl...No, it wasn't her. It was somebody new...What? It's like, six in the morning. Scott opens the bathroom door. Sunlight ignites the room.Arrrrgh!Libraries remind me of grade school.Uh. Let's talk about something else. The hiss of ball bearings catches Scott's attention. He freezes as he sees THE ROLLERBLADING GIRL FROM HIS DREAM skating towards the desk in SEXALICIOUS SLOW MOTION.It was...uh...my hand slipped.My girlfriend? A meek Knives sits next to Young Neil on the couch.Sorry, what are we doing?Party?Ugh. I thought you guys split.Aw, man. This is going to suck.Awww maaan......this sucks.I'm going to go pee due to boredom. Scott exits frame.Hey Comeau.This is Coke Zero. I don't drink.Do you know this one girl with hair like this? Scott sketches an incomprehensible drawing of Ramona.Hey, what's up?Hey, you know Pacman?Well you know Pac-Man was originally Puckman but not because Pac-Man looks like a hockey puck and paku-paku-paku means flapping your mouth and they changed it because if you scratch out the \"P\" and turn it into an \"F'\u009d? You know? Like...Um...am I dreaming? Ramona looks at Scott blankly. He slowly skulks away.I'll leave you alone forever now.DUDE. What do you know about Ramona Flowers?!LADYDUDES! What do you know about Ramona Flowers?Yeah. What else? JUMP CUT through a FLURRY OF FACES as Scott asks everyoneYou know her? Tell me. Now.Does she really?Did she reeally?Did they reeeally?Yeah, I don't know what it is about that girl, she just-I thought you guys broke up.That's garbage! Completely untrue.Misunderstanding.Not what it looked like!Hey, me and Kim are all good now. SCOTT looks to KIM. We hear the sound of arctic winds.I guess Wallace.So, that girl. From my dream.I saw her at the library...So then I'm at this party, and hey! There she is.I think she's...I think she's the girl of my dreams.I've never been so sure about something.What's that?I'm not getting it, friend. Wallace drifts off. RINGY RING! Scott answers. INTERCUT with STACEY sitting on a bus on her cellphone.Not even!Wait. Who told you?He's not even conscious!Don't you have a job to do?Wallace, how do you do that? HARD CUT to MORNING LIGHT filling the room!Amazon.ca. What's the website for that?Awesome! I have to order something reeeally cool.Dude! This thing claims I have mail!Dude! Now I'm reading it!\"Dear Mr. Pilgrim, It has come to my attention that we will be fighting soon. My name is Matthew Patel, and I'm\" blah blah '\u009cfair warning'\u009d blah blah...hmm. This is...this is...THIS IS...!!!This is boring. Delete! '\u009cCLICK.'\u009d Scott walks to the front door. Moments pass.Maybe.You were saying? Scott opens the door. It's KNIVES CHAU!Heyyy...Attack hug. That's cute. He plasters on his best fake smile.How could I possibly forget?That's sucky.Uh huh.I tell ya'.I can never get past that guy. Scott has his little videogame head cut off. The '\u009cCONTINUE?'\u009d countdown comes up...10...9...8...Um, I think...I think... Scott takes a deep breath. This is never easy. 3...2...1...What? Who?Oh.Sure. Great. We follow Scott as he walks in a daze to the bathroom.Hi, um, I was thinking about asking you out, but then I realized how stupid that would be.I just woke up, and you were in my dream. I dreamt you were delivering me this package. Is that weird?It's not?Right...You don't remember me do you? I met you at the party the other day.No. Not even. That was some total ass. I was the other guy. You're Ramona Flowers right?So, you're like American?Not at all. Noooooo... Scott stands in awe of Ramona. She gives him a pen.It's something really cool. You'd be impressed.But if I sign for it, you'll leave.Okay well, can we just maybe just hang out sometime? Get to know each other? You're the new kid on the block, right? I've lived here forever. I mean...there are reasons for you to hang out with me?You are like...my dream girl.Either that or you need to start hanging out with me.Um...you know...if that's cool.Done. So, yeah. Eight o'clock?Why are you just standing there?Sorry, I just assumed you were too cool to be on time.So what do you want to do? We could get a slice at Pizza Pizza or flip through some records at Sonic Boom. Oh, or there's this awesome game called Ninja Ninja Revolution at-I'm cool with whatever you want to do.This is good. So how'd you end up in Toronto?Oh yeah?Is Gideon...is he your boyfriend?Was he your boyfriend?It's so not interesting to me. They sit on some swings in the park.I'm between jobs.My last job is a long story filled with sighs.Is that why you left New York?Well, it's certainly chilled here.I'm totally obsessed with you.I just haven't been obsessed with a girl for a long time. It's weird.Um...It's... we're just poor! We can't afford two beds! We're not gay! Actually... no... Wallace is pretty gay.I feel so stupid.I'm... mostly stupid.Exactly, yeah. The snowfall gets heavier.Yeah. I can barely see you. This whole thing is an unmitigated disaster.So this is a 'date', eh?Tongue... The snow gets heavier still. Ramona walks away.A thingy?A door? I... I... I can't see you. I'm blind. Help me.There's more than one kind?Did you make some of those up?That sounds good to me.That would actually be awesome. Ramona exits. After a moment alone, Scott ventures upstairs. He wanders towards a half open door. Pushing it open, he finds Ramona in her bedroom in her bra and skirt.AAAH! Sorry, I'm just...cold!That's...very warm. What is that?Ohh...kay. They look into each others eyes...camera circles Scott and Ramona as they begin an awesome make out session. Scott imagines himself soundtracking the kiss with a slinky bassline. Ramona breaks off, smiling. Scott is in heaven.Were you..were you just going to bring the blanket from your bed?Maybe...maybe we should both get under it...since we're so cold.I can...not have tea. The slinky bassline continues as Ramona takes her skirt off, revealing black panties to complement black bra. Scott takes his shirt off. They tumble onto the bed and make out. Then-Changed it to what? From what?Ohh...kay.This is cool, just this. It's been like a really long time, and this is...I think I needed this. Whatever this is. So, thanks.Work?Hey, can this not be a one night stand? For one thing, I didn't even get any...that was a joke.Umm...oh, come to the first round of this battle of the bands thing.Yeah, we're terrible. Please come.Wait! Can I get your number? SSSSHHHOOP! Ramona skids to a stop, right back next to Scott. She hands him a note. '\u0098RAMONA FLOWERS, 212 664-7665, xxxxxxx'\u0098Wow, girl number. Scott looks back up. Ramona is already skating far, far away.Oh, hey! It's tonight...At The-You totally came!I...uh... LEONE STAREDOWNS all around. Stacey stares at Scott. Knives and Ramona stare at each other. Wallace stares at Jimmy.Have. To. Go. Scott scurries off. We hear feedback from a mic onstage.It's just nerves! Pre-show jitters. People love us. Right? Scott sounds less than convincing. He looks up at Ramona and Knives sitting with Wallace, Jimmy and Stacey in the BALCONY.We gotta play now and loud!What did I do? Matthew Patel leaps in the air and sails toward Scott.What do I do?!Thank you, Wallace! Patel RUNS at Scott. Scott SPIN KICKS Patel in the chin and sends him flying into the air. They land in THE PIT, knocking hipsters down and squaring off in the resulting circle.Who the hell are you anyway? The LIGHTING GUY spotlights the fighters.You're what?We're fighting because of Ramona?I skimmed it.Are you a pirate?You really went out with this guy?Dude, wait...mystical powers? Patel levitates into the air and points at Ramona.That doesn't even rhyme. Scott rolls across the stage, GRABS one of Kim's CYMBALS and throws it Captain America style. It hits Patel square in the eyes. POOF, the Demon Hipster Chicks vanish.Open your eyes. Maybe you'll see.Sweet. Coins.Aw man. $2.40? That's not even enough for the bus home.Sooooooo... A bemused Scott and mortified Ramona sit on the bus home.What was all that all about?You have seven evil ex-boyfriends?So I have to fight--defeat your seven evil ex's if we're going to continue to date.So, what you're saying is...Cool. Do you want to make out?Well, someone got to second base last night. And someone has a second date tonight.You know when I say '\u0098someone', I mean me, right? I got to second base last night...maybe first and a half. Wallace shoots a look at the idiotically upbeat Scott.Oh, hey, I'm inviting Ramona over for dinner, so you can't be here tonight. I don't want you gaying up the place.One of your famous ultimatums?But...but...it's HARD.But you...you're... At this point a sleepy JIMMY wanders out of the bathroom and helps himself to coffee.You're a monster.Who's Lucas Lee? Wallace points to a hunky actor on the cover of NOW magazine.They make movies in Toronto?So, this Lucas Lee-You suck. Surprising no one. Scott grumbles off. Wallace turns the television way up. We see Lucas Lee on a payphone in some crummy thriller.Oh, hey, Knives. Um, do you want to, like, talk or whatever?Ummm... Scott checks what he's wearing. SPOOKY MUSIC underscores.It's not dorky! Why are you psychic? A beaming Knives knocks on the payphone glass.Oh. Uh...okay. Hi.Yeah, listen- The SPOOKY MUSIC gets louder, pounding inside Scott's head.Like, Chinese food?Hmm. It's not my favorite.Uh...I think that's a really bad idea. Like, really, just so bad.Well I mean, I'm too old for you!And...and...are you even allowed to date outside your race or whatever?Um, listen...I was thinking we should break up or whatever.Yeah...um...it's not going to work out.Oh. No. We broke up. Young Neil PAUSES his DS. Kim and Stills share a look.OH! Check it out, I learned the bass line from Final Fantasy 2. Scott plays the insanely simple video game tune.Aw, thanks.Aw, thanks.Yeah, but don't worry, maybe you'll meet my new new girlfriend soon.Okay!That's for me. Scott opens the door to see Ramona, now sporting BLUE HAIR.Hey...you're here?You know your hair?It's all blue.Oh yeah, this is Stephen Stills, Young Neil, that's... Kim.Is it weird not being pink anymore?Okay. Cool. See you guys tomorrow.Neil knows my parts.Yeah, good. Good. Ramona goes to the bathroom. Scott drops the act.She changed her hair.I know, but she changed it without even making a big deal about it. She's spontaneous. Impulsive. Fickle. Oh my god, what do I do?Yeah, good. Good.Don't go.You think so?'\u009cIf I strike out'\u009d?Garlic bread is my favorite food. I could honestly eat it for every meal. Or just all the time without even stopping.No. Why would I get fat?Bread makes you FAT??So I wrote a song about you.Yeah, it goes like this: Ra-mona, Ra-mona, Ra-ra-ra, Mona, Ra-mona, Ra-mona, Ra-ra-ra, Mona, Ooooh.Finished?Ha. No, sorry. It's just that I got... I got a bad haircut right before me and my big ex broke up. But it's so long ago, I can barely remember it... A deep voiced NARRATOR chimes in. Earl Jones deep.Not really.It was a mutual thing.I mean, she told me it was mutual.She was Nat when I knew her. But she stopped liking that name. Then...she stopped liking me...But it'd be cuter short! Wouldn't it?! Scott disappears and just as quickly reappears, now wearing his dorky SNOW HAT, hair tucked tightly beneath the flaps.I thought we could go for a walk.Nooo. I just love me some walking. Putting one leg in front of the other.Yeah. I don't know. I just, when I'm with you I feel like I'm on drugs. Not that I do drugs, unless you do, in which case I do drugs all the time, every drug, but...you make me feel...I don't know. Things seem a little brighter around you or something. Ramona and Scott finally reach the top of the stairs and NIGHT TURNS TO DAY, as if crossing a magical line.A totally awesome castle. They're shooting this movie up here. Ramona looks up at the looming CASA LOMA, a castle surrounded by big, bright movie set lights.Winifred Hailey and some actor guy.I forget. Let's find out.Ooh? The UNIVERSAL STUDIOS FANFARE announces LUCAS LEE as he exits his trailer, smoking a cigarette . He skates towards the set, doing kickflips. The spectators go '\u009coooh'\u009d.What? Why?Oh...my...God......you dated a FAMOUS guy?!He had snot? In his nose? But he's famous!He's famous and he talked to me!Can I get- POW! Lucas Lee punches Scott, flooring him. Scott comes back up with a pen and paper, wobbly.Can I get your autograph? POW! Lucas Lee PUNCHES Scott again. He nods to Ramona.Hey... hey... hey! I'm not done- Scott spins Lucas around, only to find an identical STAND IN!How does it feel to- KROW! Scott takes a skateboard to the face, followed by a barrage of crippling skateboard blows to his knees and ribs.Mr. Lee?You're needed back on set. Scott CHARGES Lucas Lee and leaps into a FLYING KICK. Lucas GRABS his foot and hurls him through the backdrop. RRRIP! Scott lands in a CRUMP, framed through the torn skyline. Lucas stomps over to him, preparing for the deathblow.The League of Evil Axes?Ummm......no.Really?You are a pretty good actor.But are you a pretty good skater?So you can sell them, but can you do a thingy on that rail? Scott points to the LONG HANDRAIL on the stairs.So can you do a grind thingy now?Hey, if it's too hardcore...There's girls watching.Wow.Wow.Yes! Fist bump. Scott smacks his forehead.I didn't get his autograph.Where's Ramona? Is she still here?What's the deal? Seriously.Hey. It's me, Scott again. Call me back. Scott Pilgrim.You know what really sucks though?Everything!Kisses? Seven little kisses?Why does everything have to be so complicated? Wallace crouches down to join Scott on the floor.Lesbian?Lesbians?What? Why? Are you moving in with Other Scott or Jimmy or someone?...Envy?Yeah.Approximately.I'm not doing so good right now.What? No, stop. I've been-it's been different. You have no idea.Yes, you should. I have this totally awesome girlfriend who calls me all the time. And she's America. Uh. She's American.I'm not telling you that. Ramona.What? Do you know her?It sounded like you did.Dude. WHOOSH - another blast of air whizzes by.Please.I'm really not in the mood. SHWAA - SOMETHING slices the air in front of Scott.Okay, enough! Scott punches the air in front of him. Hits SOMETHING. A DIMINUTIVE DIRTY BLONDE dressed in a punk rock kung fu get up lands on the ground with a thump. She spins to face Scott.Listen, I've had it today. Can we not do this right now?What's that from?Well whatever this is about, can it wait till I'm in the right frame of mind?Wait, am I asleep right now?So, technically this is not a nightmare.So how can I not wake up? If I'm not actually asleep.Well, I'm really, really not up for this. Whatever it is.What?Oh man. Someone help me.It's Scott.No, it's Scott. It's actually me.I didn't do anything. It's everyone else that's crazy.Look I need to talk to you, I'm having a meltdown or whatever. Are you still working?Cool, I'm coming in. Scott hangs up the phone and walks two steps into-Think I'll make it a decaf today. Stacey turns around, revealing herself to be JULIE!AH! What did you do with my sister? Stacey taps on the window outside, mouthing that she has to go. Scott turns back to Julie, not happy.Is there anywhere you don't work?How do you do that with your mouth?Uh. Can I get a caramel macchiato?Me? Wreak havoc? Julie points at THE CLASH AT DEMONHEAD poster behind the counter with concert dates at the bottom.So I can pick up my coffee over here? Scott retreats away from Julie and bumps right into... RAMONA. They share an awkward moment. She looks at the floor.Yeah. You kind of disappeared.No. No, I want to hang. The whole evil ex-boyfriend thing. No biggie.I mean, I know it's early days, but I don't think anything can really get in the way of how I SHIT! Scott hides behind Ramona as a lithe figure emerges from the steamed-milk mists of the coffee shop...the singer from THE CLASH AT DEMONHEAD has seemingly stepped out of the poster.It's my ex.Yeah?Yeah.YOU'RE jealous?You left me! For that cocky pretty boy!Yeah. I know. You left me for a guy I've never even seen.That's so not going to happen.No, that was Envy.She's totally jealous of you.Yeah. How. About. That.Do you mind if we don't get into that right now?Basically.I can see how it sucks. Having the past come back to haunt you.What do you want to think about?I couldn't stop thinking about my stupid ex-girlfriend. A bleary Jimmy sits up between them all.Double negative. Tricky.Right. I'm not gonna let her toy with me. From this moment on, I will think of Envy Adams no more!I hate you.Can't we do our own secret shows?What would you do? If your ex was in a band and they wanted you to open for them?Yeah.Yeah, we're all adults right?What the hell?Briefly. Briefly.I gotta pee on her. I mean, I gotta pee. Pee time.That guy on bass? That's Todd.You know?Oh no. Envy lets her coat slip off, revealing a stunning figure.I think I'm going to throw up. Julie opens the backstage door and huffs.All of us?Knives!? Young Neil rushes to Knives' aid. Scott boils. Todd smirks.That is IT, you cocky cock! YOU'LL PAYKK...my neck...yy...your hair...No kidding...anyone can be...vegan.Ovo what?If I peed my pants, would you pretend I just got wet from the rain?Oh. How about you give me the Cliff Notes on how and why you ended up dating this a-hole?If there's a key element in his backstory that can help me out in a critical moment of not dying? Yes. A brief, scrappy ANIMATED FLASHBACK of Young Todd and Ramona.Have you dumped everyone you've ever been with? You've never been the dumpee? Ramona shrugs.He and me.I...dislike you. Capiche? Understand?What?Um...Sorry, so what's on Monday?You used to be so...nice! Scott CHARGES at Todd, who PSYCH-THROWS him back into the club. We hear a distant CRUMP. Stills calls through the hole.The reverb is hurting my soul!!! Scott slides across the floor and slams right into the wall. Todd LEVITATES, fauxhawk rising. He hovers next to him.What say we drink to my memory? Fair trade blend with soymilk?Actually, I poured soy in this cup, but thought real hard about pouring it in that one. You know, in my mind's eye or whatever.You just drank Half & Half. TWO TRENDY POLICE TYPES BUST IN THROUGH THE WALL, making two more holes and pointing their fingers like deadly weapons.You once were a vegone, but now you will be gone!Uh, sorry I guess.You kicked my heart in the ass. So I guess we're even. Natalie.Maybe they should. Now let's get out of here. A battle worn Scott limps through the hole in the wall. Ramona follows, shooting Envy a look on the way out.Uh huh.Do I look like I'm not okay? Scott does not look okay. Stills coughs.I kind of almost died back there, so...Hey, we can totally go.So let's go. Scott takes another bite. Other Scott whispers to Wallace.No, I'm fine, I'm fine. It's just-Well, not that fighting harder and harder battles for your love is getting old or anything...but have you ever dated someone who wasn't a total ass?But I'm part ass?Wait...is that good?But not...later?Yeah, I'd just like to live. Scott and Ramona enter a big, fartsy, artsy WAREHOUSE.My baggage doesn't try and kill me every five minutes. What did you do to your ex-boyfriends to make them so insane?Knives?I believe...I broke up with her.Knives is with Young Neil now, she's totally cool with it. They pass Knives and Young Neil. She seemingly has no interest in her date and simply stares at Scott lovingly.Yeah. She's very mature for her age. It was a very healthy break up. We're all peaches and gravy. We hear an offscreen distant '\u0098nooooo' from Knives.Me and Kim? I can barely remember. Why, is it important?It was just...yeah. I don't know. It was high school. She had freckles. It was cool, I guess.Yeah, it kind of ended. We changed.OKAY! I had to fight a dude to get with her! I fought a crazy eighty foot tall purple suited dude! And I had to fight 96 guys to get to him, too! He was flying and shooting lightning bolts from his eyes! He was totally awesome and I kicked him so far he saw the curvature of the earth! Does that make you feel any better?Sorry. I'm not usually like this.I guess this whole ex-boyfriends thing is really messing with my head.Why do you keep saying- PAF! A foot appears out of nowhere and KICKS Scott in the head, sending him flying across the dance floor. Scott looks up at his opponent, the MYSTERY ATTACKER!Girl from earlier?You know this girl?What...is...she...talking about?You and her?!You had a sexy phase?Wallace?This is happening right?I mean, this is live?I'm not sure I can hit a girl. They're soft.What? How does that work?Okay. As Roxy's leg descends, Scott reaches up with one finger and lightly TICKLES the back of Roxy's knee.Two gin and tonics please.Only on special occasions. Why? Did you want one? Scott swigs down his drink. Ramona tries to lighten things.Maybe you could just give me a list of all your exes so at least I know who's going to beat my ass into the ground next.Just out of sheer curiosity and concern for my mortal well-being, is there anyone at this party you haven't slept with?As in '\u0098get out of here'? Or as in '\u0098split split'?How could I not? I feel like we just washed our sexy laundry in public.I've had like one drink.Who the hell are the Katayanagi Twins?Apparently.You know what? I don't know and I don't want to know.Good. I play better in a bad mood.It's not an issue. You know bands, I know battles. We got it covered.Not only do I want to take part. I want to take them apart.Aren't the Katamaris or whatever on first?That's impossible-Okay. My bad.Come on man! I put aside my problems for the music. If I can do that, we can do anything.What? No. I haven't seen her since the other night.Gideon...is here? Where? Stills points to the '\u009cMystery Geek'\u009d, who smirks and whispers in Ramona's ear. This is GIDEON GRAVES, 37, ASSHOLE.That's Gideon? Scott's eyes reflect Ramona's hair and turn GREEN. He struggles to his feet. The crowd slowly stops clapping as Scott pulls Stills to his feet, then helps Kim up.Alright. Let's do this! Kim, inspired by Scott's new hardcore attitude, comes in heavy on the kick drum. BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM! Heads nod in time as Sex Bob-Omb ROCK OUT! Their waveforms transform a mass of snow into a GREEN EYED YETI! The Katayanagis fight back with their future sounds and their Sonic Dragon stalks towards Sex Bob-Omb, slinking on perfect beat with the Katayanagis' spooky music. The Yeti and the Dragons CLASH at center stage, fighting in time to the music! Scott and Stills bring their pick hands down like fierce PUNCHES. The Yeti brings it's fists down on The Dragon. Sex Bob-Omb HAMMER DOWN THE FINAL NOTE:Getting a life. Scott swipes the SCOTT HEAD and jumps into the still- applauding crowd. He can't find Ramona, but comes upon KNIVES standing alone in her homemade Sex Bob-Omb T-shirt.You seem... different. Knives shrugs, different.Ramona... Scott follows. Knives watches him go, eyes narrowing.Ramona. I have something I need to tell you.I really, really mean it.What did you want to tell me?What?Oh okay... A sleek black '\u009861 Lincoln Continental pulls up behind.Bob-omb.You think we're gonna sell our souls to you? Well then guess- We hear SCRIBBLING. Stills has picked up the contract and is furiously signing it using Scott's back. Kim shrugs and signs it too, before trying to hand it back to Scott.Nuh-uh. I can't be part of the band with this douche-in-charge.Then you're going to need to find someone else to play bass. A cough. A meek Young Neil slides into view, bass in hand.I said '\u0098lesbians'!The wha?Like...with jetpacks? Stacey stands to go, gives Scott a hug.Seven.Aaah!Was that Other Scott or Jimmy or someone?Right.Right. And the year.I get it.She's with Gideon.Thanks. RINGY RING. Scott stares at the phone. Some guy picks up.Is Ramona with you?No, I just spilled cocoa on my crotch.Mm.Whatever.What if I want the satisfaction?I'm not here to drink.What if I have a beef...with you?You mean '\u009cThe League'\u009d?I'll show you how ancient of history it is. Scott gets into a fighting stance. Gideon loses his cool.Well I ain't moving...buddy.Was that not clear? Was that not clear? Sex Bob-Omb shake their heads. Gideon stands up, flexes.Because, I'm in love with her. Ramona and Scott lock eyes. A new power comes over Scott. He reaches for the HEART DESIGN printed on his ratty vintage T- shirt and pulls a FLAMING BLUE SWORD from his own chest.Your club sucks, by the way. Gideon approaches, to administer a final blow.Can we please stop all this fighting! Nobody stole anybody. Knives, I dated you and then I dated Ramona. Okay?No! I cheated on Knives. With you.You weren't wronged? Scott breaks into a flop sweat.Right? Knives and Ramona stare at Scott.Ugh. Ramona appears out of nowhere; fainter than before.You know what sucks? Getting killed by THAT guy. Why him?Well, maybe now would be the time to get into it. Seeing as I'm about to die.So why go back?Well, that's legitimately disappointing. I really will leave you alone forever now...That is evil.So this kinda sucks for everybody, eh?You can't say I didn't try. I really fought for you back there.Knives?I feel like I learned something. Which would be great if I wasn't dead. Ramona is gone. Scott slumps to his knees.So...so alone. DA-DING. The PILGRIM-HEAD appears and rotates around Scott.Ahhhhhh... We FLASH BACK to Scott swiping the PILGRIM HEAD, then FAST FORWARD through the breakup with Ramona and Sex Bob-Omb. We hear Scott screaming throughout this magical restart.Wallace, when my journey began, I was living in an ordinary world. Ramona skated through my dreams and it was like a call to adventure, a call I considered refusing. But my Mentor, that's you, told me if I want something bad enough I have to fight for it. So I did. There were tests, allies, enemies. I approached a deep cave and went through a crazy ordeal, during which I totally seized the sword. Sadly, I died. Then I resurrected! Now I realize what I should have been fighting for all along. But before I do that, I need to ask one final favor of you.Could you put a robe on and hand me the phone? Wallace flicks on a bedside lamp, hands him the phone.Toronto. Chaos Theatre. Gideon Graves.Hey, pal. I feel terrible about everything. I don't want any hard feelings, so I figure why not be the bigger man and give you a call.Sorry, what I meant to say is '\u009cI'm coming over to kill you'\u009d. Scott hangs up and heads for the door, hardcore.You seen one...Your hair looks stupid. The Hipster Kid EXPLODES into COINS.Whatever. Scott SPLIT KICKS them in the faces, knocking them out.Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. Stephen, the new line-up rocks. You guys sound better without me. Young Neil? You have learned well. From this point forward, you shall be known as '\u009cNeil'\u009d. And Kim? Kim looks at Scott, deadpan as ever.Sorry about...everything. Kim shrugs.Sorry about me.Save it. You're pretentious, the club sucks, I have beef, let's do it. Scott goes straight into fight mode.No...I want to fight you for me. Scott reaches for the HEART DESIGN printed on his ratty T- shirt and pulls a FLAMING RED SWORD from his own chest.Kim?How's it going back there?Knives! I know you're in here! Don't attack Ra- Knives SAILS through the air and KICKS Ramona in the head SUPER HARD. We hear a METALLIC KLONK. They square off, Ramona staggered, Knives pulling KNIVES.No, Knives. I hurt you. I cheated on you. Knives steps back, stunned.I cheated on both of you. And I'm sorry. I was a different guy back then. Knives' frown melts. Scott turns to Ramona.And...you're not a fat ass. She didn't mean that. So, are we all good? Ramona rubs the back of her head. The CHIP no longer blinks.Oh, you got a fight alright. Scott steps into a fighting stance. Knives joins him.You're right. I'm not cool enough for Ramona. And you got another thing right. You are blowing up. Right now. Scott spins and BACK HEELS Gideon in the face. Gideon's head EXPLODES, his glasses SAILING down the steps of the pyramid. Then his body follows suit in an almighty-Yeah?No. This is something I have to face on my own. The girls reluctantly exit stage left as Scott walks forward to confront his dark side. Scott and Negascott face off. Both take a step forward...Aw, nothing. We just shot the shit. He's a super-nice guy. We actually have a lot in common. Scott runs his fingers through his hair.What?Yeah?You do? Scott smiles, then realizes Ramona has gone. He turns to see her, pulling her hood up and walking into the darkness. Scott calls after her. Steps tentatively away from Knives.Hey... Where are you going? Ramona, hoping to slip away, stops and turns back.After all that?I think I understand. Snow begins to fall. Ramona straightens his parka tenderly.For what?That's kind of sad.Yeah. And stuff. She turns to walk off again. Scott watches, then hears-Wha?But what about you?Hey... mind if I tag along?", "clean_line": "playing little games things ride bus meaningful conversations yearbook club went friends um know drama

Knives DROPS her bag, books scattering everywhere.Of course I'll be good!Am I normally not? Stephen Stills comes to the door and peers through.Wow.Hi, sorry, what was your name?You play the drums? REVEAL Kim sitting behind the drumset, sticks in her hands.That is so awesome.Hi. What do you play?You guys...are so...amazing.I can't even...Sex Bob-Omb. Amazing.Scott! Heyyyy! Knives skips to Scott. Her shy friend TAMARA lingers behind.Oh, hi! Do you want to know who in my class is gay?Ohmigod, like...wow.Oh, I got it!Tamara is into this Korean guy, Bobby, but everyone thinks Bobby has a crush on Mina.I don't listen to much music. I know a lot of kids who play piano or whatever, but you guys ROCK.I mean, you guys are gonna be HUGE.Excuse me, do you have anything by 'The Clash At Demonhead'?Oh, I heart them so much.I mean, I've...I've never gone out with someone so talented....no.I've never even kissed a guy. Knives blushes and looks at the ground. Scott hugs her.So this is your secret lair? Can I come in?Oh, okay.Sure. They literally walk across the street to a small house.Wow.What's wrong?That must seem like a reeeeally long time ago.Do you know that girl? The Rollerblading Girl delivers a package from AMAZON.CA to the librarian. Scott's gaze follows the GIRL as she blades out of the library. Pensive guitar underscores his thoughts.Scott? Scott continues to stare at the girl. Time slows to a crawl.I'll... I'll be quieter.Attack hug! Knives smothers Scott.Remember you were supposed to meet me at the bus stop a half-hour ago?Yearbook club is getting SO boring. I cannot believe the music they put on while we work.Hannah broke up with Alan and now she's all into Derek......but Tamara claims she has dibs on Derek.Combo! Knives goes to flip over Scott, but he messes up. THE MIRROR IMAGE of Scott's videogame avatar appears on screen.Uh oh, NegaNinja. NEGANINJA - squares up against Scott's avatar.Do you want to keep going? Scott takes a long look at Knives.The Toronto International Battle of The Bands?!Is there a prize or something?!You don't know?I will do everything I can to get out of study group and come.Oh my gosh, who are you battling?Oh my gosh, I hate them too!Hey. Knives pecks Scott on the cheek. He pushes her away. Knives looks kinda sexy, wearing makeup and new clothes.Do you like?Well, I was on the bus with my Mom- Knives freezes, staring at the stage.OH MY GOSH, they're on!Are you wearing a tan jacket? Like a spring jacket? And a hoodie?And a dorky hat?!I can't believe they're coming to town. Will you take me to the show?Oh, hey, I wanted to invite you over for dinner.Yeah.Yeah. Well, to meet my parents. It's my birthday dinner.No, it's okay. Why?No you're not! My Dad is nine years older than my Mom...I don't care. I'm in...LOVE!Really?Oh... Scott walks out, leaving Knives in the aisle.Is Scott here?He's dating a fat-ass hipster chick! I hate his stupid guts! I'm gonna disembowel him!He only likes her cause she's old! She's probably like 25! She's just some fat-ass white girl, you know?She's got a head start! I didn't even know there WAS good music until like two months ago! Okay, this really burns.I mean, he knew I was cool but he thought I was too young, so he tried to find someone cool but old.Well she THINKS she's cool. This is all her fault.It MUST be her fault. Obviously it's just a twist of fate or whatever, isn't it? Star crossed lovers! Born too late! Knives looks in the mirror: HER HAIR IS EXACTLY LIKE RAMONA.Oh God...I look so...so good. Knives throws a long scarf on, looking sexy, eyes narrowing.Scott Pilgrim destroyed my heart. But I know how to get him back. PUSH into Knives, as she plots. Tamara pops into frame.Hey Ramona.Hey Scott. Knives heads into Young Neil's arms at the other end of the bar. Scott struggles with something resembling jealousy.Oh my God. Just oh my God.How do you know Envy???Um...Envy? I read your blog. Todd and Julie glare at Knives.You're my role model Envy.I just came to see the show. I'm not even stalking you. Knives's unusally composed demeanor gives Scott pause.I feel like I know stuff now. Scott and Knives lock eyes. Scott suddenly spots a flash of GREEN HAIR exiting the building.You'll pay for what you did to him!I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to HER! Angle on a confused RAMONA standing behind Gideon.You stole him with your advanced American slut technology. DUAL DUEL! The fighters weave in and out of each other, throwing blocks and punches, KUNG FU STYLE.Then you cheated on me, Scott!Steal my boyfriend, taste my steel. Scott jumps between them, hands held out.No, Scott! This fat ass hurt me and I will have my revenge!You cheated on me Scott?Negascott! NEGASCOTT walks towards Scott, Knives and Ramona. Fringed hair. Dark clothes. Evil face. Knives and Ramona flank Scott in a fighting stance.What happened?Your hair.It's getting really shaggy. Scott's HAT appears on his head! He looks totally freked.I like it.

You're totally my bitch forever.Hey, you know me.You know me. Wallace tosses the NOW magazine aside, starts texting.You know me.

Does he wear glasses?You're too good for him. Run.What is it, Scott?What is it, Scott? A scruffy, goateed guy wakes right between Scott and Wallace:Girl?We don't use the E-word in this house.Speaking of new, weren't you supposed to take your fake high school girlfriend to the library a half-hour ago?Guess who's druuunk?You guess right. Wallace flops onto the futon, landing next to Scott.Girl. Okay...Library...can I pretend we're talking about a guy?There he is.You think he's...Mmm. Then you should break up with your fake high school girlfriend.Then you should break up with your fake high school girlfriend.Break...up...fake...high school...girlfriend......Amazon.ca.It's amazing what they can do with computers these days.I'm so happy for you.Scott. Are you waiting for the package you just ordered?It's the weekend. It won't ship until Monday at the earliest.Hey.Heyyy.Jimmy. Do they rock or suck?That was a test, Jimmy. You passed.Sweet! I love this one!Watch out! It's that one guy!What's up with his outfit?Someone's happy.Someone's lucky then.Okay, Scott. But in return I have to issue an ultimatum.It may live in infamy...You have to break up with Knives. Today. Okay? Scott huffs and helps himself to some of Wallace's bacon.If you don't do it, I'm going to tell Ramona about Knives. I swear to God, Scott.I didn't make up the gay rulebook. If you have a problem with it, take it up with Liberace's Ghost.Now put the bacon down and go do your dirt while I watch the Lucas Lee marathon on TBS Superstation.He was this pretty good skater and now he's this pretty good actor.He's filming a Winifred Hailey movie in Toronto right now.Yes. I am stalking him later.Lucas Lee is not important to you right now! Get out.Are you doing okay there?So? It looks nice blue.I can't believe you were worried about me gaying up the place. Ramona returns. Wallace pulls on a jacket.I'll leave you lovebirds to it. I'm heading up to Casa Loma to stalk my hetero crush. Scott stops Wallace at the door, with a panicked whisper.Will you man the hell up? You could get to 2nd and a half base.Well, if you strike out in the next hour, come find me at the Castle.Okay, '\u009cwhen'\u009d. See you in sixty.I think I'm about to right now.Lucas Lee.I want to have his adopted babies.Slut.I can think of no higher accolade. Lucas steps to his mark and puffs up into action hero mode.Scott. Evil ex. Fight.Ask them how it feels to always get his sloppy seconds!Hi. Big fan.Wow, he totally bailed.No, she totally bailed.Yeah, you said that last night.What?Come on guy, you can't say you didn't see this coming. It was right under your nose. Wallace points to the NOTE Ramona scribbled which is pinned literally under Scott's nose on the refrigerator: RAMONA FLOWERS, 212 664-7665, xxxxxxxWhat did you think these were?Seven deadly X's.If you want something bad, you have to fight for it. Step up your game. Break out the L-word.The other L-word.Okay, it's '\u009clove'\u009d. I wasn't trying to trick you or anything. Look, if she's really the girl of your dreams, then you have to let her know. You have to overcome any and all obstacles that lie in your path. You have the spirit of a warrior, Scott. You can do it! Be with her! It's your destiny!Or someone. Either way, I'm kind of banking on her calling you back so I won't have to evict you and feel all guilty and shit. RINGY RING. Scott and Wallace look at the phone.I have a feeling that's for you, guy. Scott picks up. A SEXY, NON-RAMONA VOICE REPLIES...Oh, shit.Okay. Everything does suck. Scott grunts. RINGY RING. Wallace grins and grabs the phone.Or does it? Scott sits bolt upright, expectant.Oh, hey Knives. Scott lays back down. FUCK.What's that? You're outside? Scott sits bolt upright again. FUCK! Wallace opens the door a crack. Knives shivers outside, pale and broken looking.You know what? Behind Wallace, we see Scott LEAP through a window head first. GLASS SMASHES.He just left. Knives sighs. Scott sprints away in the background.Scott. Just because Envy's back in town doesn't make it not over.Word.Envy Adams. I hate that bitch so much I kind of love her.Not to my knowledge.I mean, not with fists.Yet.Uh huh?Uh huh.Oh yeah. KICK HER IN THE BALLS,Presumably you just saw someone's junk, and I apologize for that.Or someone.It's Chris.Scott, you know I love you. But I need my own bed tonight. For sex.I may need it the rest of the week too.Maybe you can move in with Ramona. Scott stares deep into his cocoa and shakes his head.Ah. That sucks. But you know, it's probably just because he's better than you.He'll certainly have better hair. Scott nods.Either way, I think this fight is over. Scott nods.You can sleep on the floor until you get somewhere else to stay. I got you muffs and blinkers in case this might happen. Wallace produces earmuffs and a sleep mask.What a perfect asshole. Scott turns, alarmed. REVEAL Wallace on the other cordless.Forget what I said earlier. Finish him.Turn off the light! Scott flicks the light off.

Scott begins to babble.Yeah that's amazing.Um, no, that's okay. You just have to sign for this alright?It's not weird at all.No, it's just like, you've got this really convenient subspace highway running through your head that I like to use. It's like three miles in fifteen seconds.Oh yeah. I forgot you guys don't have that in Canada.Were you the Pac-Man guy?That's me.Why, am I coming off as rude?You know...you need to sign for this. Whatever this is?You still have to sign.Yeah. That's how it works.You're all over the place.I need to find a new route.You want me to hang out with you?If I say yes, will you sign for your damn package? Scott finally signs on the dotted line. And throws the package straight in the trash.Dude, I'm totally waiting on you.Well. You assumed wrong.I'm not into simulated violence.This is good. Scott and Ramona trudge through the snow in the empty park.Just needed to escape I guess.I got this job here. And Gideon had always said Toronto was one of the great cities so...He's...a friend.Do you mind if we don't get into that right now?So what about you? What do you do?Between what and what?I know plenty of those.Pretty much. It was time to head somewhere a little more chilled.Yeah. Uh. Chilled as in cold.Yeah.I didn't mean to get you obsessed.That's probably because you sleep with a guy.I was guessing from your apartment, but you totally do!Dude, relax. I believe you. You're too desperate to be gay.Aw... you're probably not that stupid. Laughing, Ramona hops off her swing.Well, you're definitely stupid if you want to go out with me.This is ridiculous. Isn't it like April?I think 'act of God' is a pretty decent excuse for a lousy date.Did I say 'date'? Slip of the tongue.Anyway, night's not over yet. I think there's a thingy up here somewhere.A door.What kind of tea do you want?We have blueberry, raspberry, ginseng, sleepytime, green tea, green tea with lemon, green tea with lemon and honey, liver disaster, ginger with honey, ginger without honey, vanilla almond, white truffle, blueberry chamomile, vanilla walnut, constant comment and earl grey.I think I'll have sleepytime.Let me get you a blanket.Dude! I'm changing. Scott covers his eyes and our screen goes BLACK.Here, does this help?I guess...Well...what about our tea?I changed my mind.I don't want to have sex with you, Pilgrim. Not right now.It's not like I'm gonna send you home in a snowstorm or anything. You can sleep in my bed. And I reserve the right to change my mind about the sex later. Ramona curls up next to Scott.You're welcome. They exchange a smile. Then without warning we jump cut to -I have to work.You have to leave.What did you have in mind?Sure.See you at the show, Scott Pilgrim.Yes. I did totally come. Scott is so amazed at her presence, his social skills vanish.Hey.He's...um. He's a friend.Is that seriously the end of the story?Anyone need another drink? Patel attacks Scott with spin kicks. Scott blocks. Patel punches. Scott blocks, then holds his hand up for a time-out.Yeah, in the seventh grade. The Lighting Guy SWINGS the spotlight to Ramona in the balcony. We see a sketchy childlike ANIMATED FLASHBACK.It was football season and for some reason, all the little jocks wanted me. Matthew was the only non-white, non-jock boy in school, probably in the entire state, so we joined forces and took 'em all out. We were one hell of a team. Nothing could beat Matthew's mystical powers. Nothing but pre-teen capriciousness. We only kissed once. After a week and a half, I told him to hit the showers.Well, it was great meeting you. Tell your gay friends I said bye.I'll lend you the 30 cents. Ramona yanks Scott away. The Promotor ambles back onstage.Uh, I guess... Ramona takes a breath. Looks deep into Scott's eyes.If we're going to date, you may have to defeat my seven evil ex's.Seven ex's, yes.Defeat.Pretty much.Uh, I guess.Uh... Scott kisses Ramona. The studio audience 'awwww's.Yes. Like you said. Is it not cool? Scott ushers her in, weirded out by this hair development.I know of it.Yeah. I just dyed it. Are you going to introduce me?Hey everyone. Everyone mumbles back. Scott still stares at Ramona's hair.I change my hair every week and a half, dude. Get used to it. So...uh...how do you guys all know each other?Got any embarassing stories?How's dinner coming along?This is actually really good garlic bread.You'd get fat.Bread makes you fat.Oh yeah?I can't wait to hear it when it's finished.Your hair's pretty shaggy.What?Sounds like a bad time.What was her name?Your hair is cute. I like it long.What? Why are you wearing that?Tell me we didn't come out here just so you could cover your hair with that hat.You seem a little...heightened.What is this place?Who's in it?Oh, who?Did you find the guy you're stalking?Mr. Lee?Ooh.Oh, man. We gotta go.I used to date that clown.Wallace. I am not a slut.In 9th grade. We had drama. Actually, it might have been math. I just remember there being lots of drama.He just followed me around. He was a little snot nosed brat.It's not a big deal. I only dated him for a week and a half-Sorry that got a little crazy last night.Yeah, I do that. Listen, I know it's hard to be around me sometimes. I'll understand if you don't want to hang anymore.Exes.The big one? Scott nods. LEONE STAREDOWN between Envy and Ramona.I'm gonna...excuse me. Ramona goes to order coffee, leaving Envy to fix on Scott.So...that was Nat?So...what did you guys talk about?Envy's jealous? How about that?What happened with the two of you?And two weeks later, you heard they were sleeping together I guess?I dated a Todd once. That didn't end well either.Is it wrong that I try not to think about it?How warm my place is right now. Ramona stops and kisses him.If my ex was in the band?It might be a little awkward. But maybe it's the grown up thing to do.I don't know. Did you?Hey. Ramona exits, confused. Knives follows.What the hell?Who is that girl again?How old is she? A '\u009cWHEEL OF FORTUNE'\u009d spins INSIDE SCOTT'S HEAD, with selections such as '\u009cIt was nothing'\u009d and '\u009cShe was nobody.'\u009d The wheel sticks between '\u009cI gotta pee.'\u009d and '\u009cWho, her?'\u009dI know.Hey Todd.Mmm hmm.I think we should get out of here.What of it?It's not raining.Is that really important right now?I was only dating Lucas until the minute Todd walked by. I guess that's not very nice, but I used to be kind of...like that. Young Ramona shoves Young Lucas down a hill and starts making out with Young Todd.We hated everyone. We wrecked stuff. Nobody cared. Young Ramona and Young Todd wreck stuff. Nobody cares.He punched a hole in the moon for me. It was pretty crazy. Young Todd punches a hole in the moon. It's pretty crazy.A week and a half later, he told me his Dad was sending him to the Vegan Academy, so I dumped him. Does that help you at all? The FLASHBACK ends. Scott can only fixate on one aspect.Look, I've dabbled with being a bitch. It's part of the reason I moved here. I was really hoping to put it all behind me.Crummy way to end things, I know. Envy blinks, in shock. Julie pops into shot.Are you okay?You sure about that?Do you want to go?I'm not saying I want to go.I'll do whatever you want to do.We really don't have to go to this thing. It'll probably be a bad scene all around and we've already had a full night.It's just...?So far you're not a total ass.If it makes you feel better, you're the nicest guy I've dated.It's what I need right now.Scott, I don't have all the answers. I'd just like to live in the moment if I can.Okay, I know Todd was bad news. But are you saying Envy wasn't? We all have baggage.Exes.No break up is painless. Someone always gets hurt. What about you and that girl Knives?Who broke up with who?And was she cool with that?You sure about that?And what about you and Kim? They pass Kim. She's also staring at Scott. Not lovingly.Hey, you want to know everything about my past, dude.That's it?That's really the whole story?Well now you are being a total ass. Welcome to the club. In the back glass of the bar, Scott sees his reflection: fringed hair, wicked glare. He catches himself.Hey, don't worry. I don't know what I'm like anymore.Exes.Roxy? Scott gets up. The three square off in a triangle.It was just a phase.I didn't think it would count! It meant nothing.I was just a little bi-curious.Do that again and I will end you.Then Gideon best get his pretentious ass up here, '\u0098cos I'm about to kick yours out of the Great White North.Believe it. An embarrassed Scott watches with the rest of the crowd.I'd rather be dead than go back. He's a creep, you're a bitch and you all deserve each other.Meaning? Roxy points an accusing finger at the mortified Scott.You don't have a choice. Ramona positions Scott into a fighting stance as Roxy CHARGES with deadly intent. Ramona puppeteers Scott into a furious volley of PUNCHES on Roxy. She staggers, winces.Her weak point's the back of her knees!Whenever we were making out, I-Sooooo...I thought you didn't drink.I guess we really don't know that much about each other do we? Scott seems immediately drunk.Oh, like a handy little laminate or something? Let me see if I can find one. Maybe we could exchange our information. Scott has already downed his second drink.I really think we should split.I'd hope you could figure that out. Or did you miss the part where I saved your ass?Dirty laundry. You're drunk.Well I'm sorry I cared. I don't enjoy all this Scott. In fact I'm sick of it. I thought you might be more understanding.You're just another evil ex- boyfriend waiting to happen. Ramona walks off and loudly announces.And yes, there is someone at this party I haven't slept with. You. Ramona leaves. Another crescendo of gossip echoes around the room. Scott's friends gather round in a pity party. But then - Ramona returns, handing Scott a LAMINATED LIST.P.S. Here's your stupid list. Ramona exits proper. Scott looks at the list. It reads-Yeah, I have something to-What?Oh. Okay.That we have to break up.Yeah...it's not going to work out.It's Gideon. I just...I can't help myself around him.Yeah.What?You're kidding right? Knives pulls out KNIVES and charges! Ramona fights defensively, redirecting Knives' parries without harming her.What the hell is your deal?I don't know what you're talking about, I didn't steal anyone. Scott lands a KICK to Gideon's chest, sending him flying off the edge of the pyramid. He then BLOCKS a punch from Knives to Ramona and spins her away, separating them.You cheated on me with Knives?Is there a difference?I'm sorry. Dying probably sucks.It's complicated.Alright... the truth is, it was me who was obsessed. I was crazy about him. But he ignored me. I was more alone when we were together than I ever was on my own. That's why I had to leave... and that's when he started paying attention.I can't help myself around him, Scott. He just... has a way of getting into my head.No. I mean, he literally has a way of getting into my head. Ramona lifts her hair up on the back of her head, revealing a blinking CHIP implanted on her skull.He's like that. Ramona covers the chip, self-consciously touching her hair.I'm sorry it had to end this way. We had a good run, I guess.Uh-huh. The winds blow harder, Ramona seeming to fade away.But someone was fighting pretty hard for you back there. Scott's eyes go wide with epiphany,I wish I was ever as fanatically devoted to anything as that girl is to you. Ramona slowly dissolve away in the sand.Never felt better.Let's both be girls. Ramona knees Gideon in the balls. Gideon SWINGS his sword at Ramona. Knives whips off her scarf, uses it to wrap up Gideon's sword arm and disarms him. Scott and Knives punch Gideon in the face in a volley ofYou two make a good combo. Ramona, awake now, makes her way towards them.Yeah.I dunno. I should probably disappear.It's hard, you know? I came here to get away, but the past keeps catching up. I'm tired of people getting hurt because of me. Ramona looks at Knives as she says this.I should tahnk you, though.For being the nicest guy I ever dated.Well... Bye and stuff.You want to come with me?", "clean_line": "know scott begins babble yeah amazing um okay sign alright weird like ve got convenient subspace highway running head like use like miles
