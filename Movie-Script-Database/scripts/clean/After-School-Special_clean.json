{"After-School-Special": {"MATT": {"raw_line": "This is unwatchable. It's not even in focus. And geez, look, the boom mike is in the shot. This is really shoddy work. 1C INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - A/V ROOM - DAY 1C The door leads into this room, as we continue on to a TV MONITOR displaying a sweaty guy's ugly face.Will that work?All great directors start this way. I'm documenting the essence of high school. Teenagers running to meet their destiny only to find it's just home room. It's very existential.Yeah. I took my camera to gym class with me.Something wrong? Deacon lets out a deep breath.So? They reach the bike rack and start unlocking their bikes.Ooh. Good movie.Were you surprised?Really?Actually, we were expecting a lot more people. Fred elbows him.What?Why?He's got a point.Ask her if she has any unusual hats. Girls like that. Deacon gives Matt a dirty look.What?Tony Montana would be very disappointed. Deacon is once again... INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY ... very depressed, as he sits, bored out of his mind in his biology class.Your dad really knows his firewalls. Deacon bursts into the room.One what?Great! That's perfect! I've already got an idea for a kind of sci-fi horror thing. It's like \"The Shining\" meets \"The Jetsons.\"With good cinematography.These have to be nicely edited. We should shoot on super 16 and transfer to video.And the guys.We can't make a porno movie.Like how much?He's got a point, Deacon.Not really. Deacon turns to Fred, who looks guilty.That was a really good speech, Deacon.Did you work that out before?I've got it. \"After School Special.\" They look at him. It's perfect. INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY WE FOLLOW a WOMAN dressed in a Fredericks of Hollywood type outfit, walking down the hallway past office suites; a mortgage company, a dentist, etc... She enters an office. As the door closes behind her, WE SEE the sign on the door, \"Ramalot Productions.\"That's it? Does that include the sex?So how do we get women for this movie?Are we supposed to have sex with these women?Let's use Principal Taggert's name.Oh, you mean like \"Johnny Hardmember\"?Ooh, I like it.You're just jealous that you don't have a cool porno name like us.That name sucks.Thanks. You sound sexy, too. JUMP CUT TO: The guys are getting excited.When you have sex with a strange man, do you imagine it's like your boyfriend or something? She just looks at him.Roger. Over. He looks at his clipboard and turns to the first woman.You can go in now. She gets up and walks through the curtain.Maybe if we put another ad in and say we're only looking for good looking models.Hawaii?No.Aloha. INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT The next night. The three guys walk downstairs dressed in Hawaiian shirts. Deacon's parents are reading and Max is watching TV.The next two years of high school depend on it.Sixteen. Fred smacks him.I'll have a seven and seven.I don't know. But I heard that guy over there order one and I like the way it sounds. Numerical. The Waitress comes back with their drinks. He pays her and then they raise their glasses.It tastes like poison. A beautiful STRIPPER in an American flag bikini approaches.Cool. BACK TO SCENEYou want mine? She laughs.We're from Hawaii.Video actually. They won't let me shoot on film. Deacon pulls out his wad of cash.Shouldn't we audition her first?I don't know. But it's kind of fun. We just wrote this whole thing about the girls' locker room.You're not putting my picture up there.They're not whores if we film them, you moron. Deacon can't believe Matt just blew it. Fred smacks him.A stripper. Her name's Ashley. He pulls out Ashley's picture from his manila folder. Jake checks it out. His eyes go wide and suddenly he's their new best friend.So, um, I'll be directing.Okay. So I want you to play this very understated. It's a very visceral scene, so it's important not to play it too over the top.Boom in position.Ashley, get into position. Matt gets behind the camera. They whisper conspiratorially. One last reality check before they take the leap.So, um, we're starting with the masturbation and then Phillip, the yearbook editor, is going to surprise you.And ... action.What?Oh yeah. Right. And Matt zooms in. Ashley continues moaning and as Matt gets closer, the camera starts shaking. He can't keep his hands steady. 54A THROUGH MATT'S VIDEO DISPLAY 54A We'd love to get a look, but the camera is shaking so much, it's just a BLUR.Okay, CUT! She turns off her performance like a light switch.Uh, no. You were great. I think I've got what I need there. I want to set up for Jake.Action. Jake opens a makeshift door to the office.Cut. Perfect. Okay, then. Let's get to the, uh, sexual material. Jake pulls off his pants and starts to look a little nervous. He stands in the corner, trying to psyche himself up.And ACTION! But Jake is still standing there, not in the shot. He's starting to sweat.Action, Jake.Action... Jake finally whips off his underwear and faces Ashley.Wait! I'm not set up for that shot!We'd have to do it like twenty times to get enough footage.Deacon. You do it.Come on. This is your big chance.Fred.Come on.I have to run the camera.Fine. I'll do it. I'll do it for the sake of the film. Hold this. He hands the camera to Deacon and starts taking off his shirt. The rest of them look at Matt with his shirt off.No, I'll do it. He desperately wants someone to hold him back.Fine with me.And that guy had real screen presence, too. Just then, Coop pulls up in his van and gets out.For fixing grades for a girl...Deacon, come quick. Deacon steps away from his class for a moment.We got a few more pre-orders and a ton of hits.Guess.We should go over the schedule for tomorrow. And make sure the script is ready. Deacon's smile fades.Is it a travelling carnival?Can we come? Fred picks up on Deacon's hesitation. This isn't good.We can just meet you there.Later. Deacon walks back to the group.What are you wearing to the party?Why not?But we told Deacon-- I mean, we can't just not show up. What if Deacon is looking for us-- This is too complicated to explain to Matt, so Fred just gives in.Cool. INT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT Amid this raging party, Deacon has taken his rightful place with the in-crowd, standing dangerously close to Naomi without his usual sidekicks weighing him down. Finally.Hey, guys. It's his sidekicks and they've got some seriously bad timing. Deacon shoots them an annoyed look.Maybe he got sucked into a black hole. He chuckles to himself.Look, we're wasting time. Deacon, why don't you just go in there? Deacon balks at first, then looks over at Ashley, lying there.Come on...And action!Fred, you get in there, too.Yeah, it'll be a great shot. Fred takes off his shorts and walks over to the other side of the bed. Ashley is offscreen, presumably lying on the bed. The two guys are facing each other.Hey, quit the chatter.Hey, why don't you guys kiss?You know. Make out with each other.Because that's what guys do in gay porn.More sausage please.You dreamed about making out with Fred?It's a \"special effect.\" If you want this film to look amateurish, you're going to have to get someone else to do it.Action. Matt starts his cheesy \"projector light effect\" and Coop takes a seat next to Ashley.Wait, it's hot! Too late. Deacon touches the cord, SCREAMS, and reels back, knocking the light over. It EXPLODES onto the floor. The carpet bursts into FLAMES.Quick, get the fire extinguisher!Over there! He spots it in the corner and grabs it. Meanwhile the flames are growing. Deacon comes over and aims the extinguisher at the flames. He depresses the lever. Nothing.Oh. Me and Fred used it when we wrote the foamy cat fight script last week. INT. FRED'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Matt and Fred are giggling and prancing around the room in bikinis discharging the fire extinguishers at each other. INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY Deacon looks at him strangely for a beat, then runs into the 72A INT. BASEMENT - LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY 72A He looks around frantically. Nothing. Then, he starts the WASHING MACHINE. It slowly starts to fill up.Hurry! Deacon turns the dial to \"large load,\" pauses and chuckles to himself.Deacon! Hurry! Deacon snaps out of it and grabs the laundry detergent bottle. He scoops up some water and RUNS into the other room. 72B INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY 72B He throws the soapy water onto the fire and Matt. The fire goes out, but Matt's not too happy about getting soaked. INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY Coop is looking down the stairs to the basement. Fred is freaking out. Ashley is still topless but covering herself up, having just put on her panties. She goes to put on her shirt whenWe had a small fire, Mrs. Lewis. I tipped over a candle. It was to set the right mood.Okay, people. Places everybody. Let's try to do this with a little heart, okay? And action. Everyone turns to their scripts and starts the rehearsal.He's not a geek. He's the Math Team Captain.Um, and the director is the only one who's allowed to say \"cut.\"Oh, sure. Why don't we throw out the script while we're at it and \"improvise.\"We want to make this movie.That's okay, Deacon.No way!I find that extremely difficult to believe. Deacon laughs.It looks great. It's the best porno film I've ever made.Well, I cut together some footage to give to Ashley for her reel, but I don't think I can finish this film.I can't even watch it. Every time I turn it on, I keep thinking about that tuna fish sandwich and Coop farting all day long.That's just it. The movie looks great, but seeing everything else -- all the disgusting, nasty stuff -- that's what's taken all the fun out of it. And I just don't want to do it any more.You know what? Fuck you, Fred. You're the wuss here. At least I don't have to whack off every time I see a girl in the hallway. Fred shoves Matt.No, you shut up! For once in your life, be a man and admit this movie was a mistake.If you didn't like making the movie, why didn't you say something?Scar Face is just a stupid movie, Fred. Fred smiles.So what do we do with this? He holds up the tape. EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT The tape is burning in the center of a huge bonfire. A massive party is raging. Tons of teenagers are dancing, drinking, and having a good time rocking to a LIVE BAND. At the center of it all are Matt, Fred, and Deacon are finally enjoying themselves.Wow. That's great, Ashley.Really?You should probably avoid pissing her off.Please don't kill us, Mr. Porno Man.We've got pre-orders! Mike stops and looks back at Vic.We pre-sold copies of our video.No. Sixty-three thousand, two hundred twelve.And...And you have to maintain the artistic vision of After School Special.The key is to try and remember what it was like before you had sex. What did you used to fantasize about? A math teacher who bends over a little too far. The door to the girls' locker room open just a sliver. Going over to visit your friend and catching his mother coming out of the shower.Not you. Deacon's mom.It's been a pleasure doing business with you, Mr. ...It's not even in focus. This is really shoddy work. Deacon takes it back from him.So, guys. I decided I'm going to apply to NYU next year. The film school.Good idea, Balls. The guys start laughing.Tony Montana would be pissed. Just then, Rachael spots them and walks over.That could work, you know, depending on my schedule.You probably shouldn't have mailed that tape back to us. The video starts repeating in continuous loop, but has been edited to sound like a rap song.I think he's got something there. Making that movie felt like we were tampering with forces we couldn't possibly understand.", "clean_line": "unwatchable focus geez look boom mike shot shoddy work int william wall high school room day

face? It's like, can't we just assume he's enjoying it? We slowly PULL BACK from the TV.How the hell do you know?It all started on my seventeenth birthday with our usual morning routine: film appreciation. The school bell RINGS and Deacon clicks off the TV.Come on, let's go. We're going to be late.And when I say film appreciation, I mean film duplication. Fred steals them, Matt copies them, and I sell them. Matt walks over to the TV and presses eject on five VCR's. The original plus four copies pop out. CLOSE ON the original tape: \"Ramalot Productions presents Dirty Darla #7,\" as Matt hands it to Fred and the copies to Deacon. They smile. INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY The guys are waiting in line for lunch.Fred's the kind of kid who's basically given up on high school. He figures his glory days are way ahead of him.You are a complete moron. Deacon and Matt walk off. Fred calls after them.Until that big payday, Fred's sex life consists of spanking it.Fred averages two to five time a day, depending on how many girls he sees in the hallway. INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY Matt is videotaping the students running down the hallway to class. Fred watches.Now Matt-- Matt's what you'd call a late bloomer. Secretary of the Audio Visual Club, amateur filmmaker, and complete dork.In the normal course of things, Matt probably wouldn't even have been our friend, but Fred likes having someone to boss around, and I think Matt's actually pretty cool once you get to know him. Just then, the burly GIRLS' SWIM TEAM COACH comes out of the girls' locker room. She walks by Matt without noticing, and the door to the locker room closes slowly. Matt's attention is drawn to it. The door stops with a CREAK, a sliver of daylight still visible. Matt shakes his head and starts to walk away towards the boys' locker room. Then, he stops. He's torn. He's still too immature to really be interested, but he thinks he should be. He looks around quickly, then slowly approaches the door. He turns his head sideways, and places it up against the crack.Well, at least he's got the key to the A/V room.Dirty Darla #7 is a modern classic. This is grade-A porn, my friend. Worth a lot more than twenty dollars.People always talk about how tough it is being a teenage girl. I mean, if I have to watch one more TV movie about bulimia or self mutilation or vaginal dryness... Deacon reaches his locker and opens it. He sees some CHEERLEADERS bouncing down the hallway. Deacon takes out some books for class.I'll tell you what's really hard. Being a seventeen year old boy. Imagine what it's like to have only one thing on your mind all day, every day, but to have absolutely no way of getting it. INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY CLOSE ON a textbook showing the anatomy of the vagina. PULL BACK to reveal Deacon, seemingly staring into space, but really staring at...Testosterone is a drug more powerful than heroin. I don't really have any evidence to support that, but the point is, a horny teenage boy will do almost anything for even a glimpse of sex. ... his BIOLOGY TEACHER's erect NIPPLES visible through her conservative bra and blouse. Aside from her flashing headlights, she's the kind of woman you wouldn't notice even if you were alone with her on a two-man luge. But that doesn't matter-- Deacon can't take his eyes off of them.We're suffering. Suffering from a deep, debilitating addiction to something we've never even had. Teenage boys are like time bombs, ready to explode.Are you talking about Rachael Unger? GUY 1 Yeah. It was at Richard Rosenblatt's party. In the bathroom.You're kidding. INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - DAY RACHAEL UNGER, Deacon's girlfriend at the time, is naked under Deacon's sheets after school one day. Deacon ENTERS from the bathroom and is immediately surprised by her state of undress.Rachael! What are you doing? She sits up and strikes a sexy pose.Now?I didn't think you were listening to me. Suddenly, Rachael becomes a little self-conscious.Of course I do. But, I, um... I don't have anything... She pulls out a condom.I have a math test tomorrow. INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY The Teacher CLEARS HER THROAT and Deacon snaps out of it. He turns away from the guys behind him as they continue to describe the John Baldwin incident.\"I have a math test tomorrow.\" The bottom line is, I just couldn't do it. I don't know why, I just couldn't. And I've cursed myself every day since then. Deacon is suddenly... INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY ... very depressed as he trudges to his locker. Which is nothing compared to how he feels when he looksHey, guys. Here's the money. He hands out the proceeds from the operation, and Matt notices that Deacon is a little out of sorts.Yeah. I heard Rachael Unger did it with John Baldwin.Shut up, Fabio. I don't see you sealing any deals.Whatever. It just wasn't good timing.Will you shut up already? Look, I've been thinking about this all day. We're juniors now. Upperclassmen.So we have a responsibility to ourselves to start having fun and getting girls. This year is our year. There's nothing holding us back any more. Over in the parking lot, JAKE, a studly senior, revs the engine on his truck. Two hot girls, KELLY and WENDY, sit on his bumper, chatting.You see? That's exactly what I'm talking about. That could be us.Why not? All we have to do is follow the simple lessons of Tony Montana in \"Scar Face.\"Listen, the porno pirating operation is bringing in plenty of money. When I get my new car tonight for my birthday, we'll have the power to go wherever we want. Then, there's nothing stopping us from getting the girls. Fred and Matt look at Deacon warily. Is this a plan? Then, the hot girls and Jake drive past the guys.I had a stomach virus, asshole. Just then, a super hot CHEERLEADER drops her car keys and bends over to pick them up.And I signal exactly two hundred feet before the turn. Rule 108-1. The unimpressed Tester remains expressionless.I begin the parallel parking maneuver by pulling within three feet of the forward vehicle. I now shift into reverse while turning the wheel two revolutions clockwise... The Tester rubs his brow. INT. DMV - DAYWow. This is great. The room is sparsely populated with a few of Deacon's RELATIVES, his MOM and DAD, younger brother MAX , and ROGER, a wheelchair-bound nerd with a face full of orthodontic headgear and braces.Yeah.Really. I was.Thanks. INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - LATER Half-eaten cake and ice cream, unwrapped presents. Matt videotapes the event.You mean there's more? Deacon can hardly contain his excitement.No, it is. It's just--No, I just thought-- I thought you guys were buying me that car I wanted. Max snickers.Now what are we going to do?You invited more people?And no one showed up?Great.Let's go.Come on, guys. Can I just get one thing that I ask for on my goddamn birthday?Hey, Coop. Can we come in? Coop un-pockets a tiny piece of paper with a thousand names on it. He examines it for a long time.Coop. It's my birthday today, so cut me some slack, all right? Coop looks him over, then opens the door.Oh, my God. There's Naomi.Yeah. Fred adjusts his pants. Deacon makes a decision. One that he'd normally never make.I'm gonna go talk to her. What have I got to lose?She's Rachael's friend. It's not like I don't know her.You remembered.Oh, right. So where's Jake?So you two aren't going out any more?No, that's okay.All right. He slips off his shoes and takes off his shirt. He walks over to the shallow end. Deacon steps in with his shorts still on.What?Oh. Okay. Sorry, I'll just leave you guys alone then--looks at her, thinks it over, and finally... slips off his shorts. He gets into the pool in his underwear, then slips them off, too, and throws them on the side of pool.Wow. This feels amazing. Someone splashes Kelly, she giggles, and the other kids swim around. Kelly swims by Deacon seductively and he smiles.Hey, give me back my clothes!No, I didn't! Give them back! Jake does a victory lap around the pool with Deacon's underwear on the stick. Everybody is laughing.Hey, watch the nads! But it's no use. The dog BITES the front of the pool toy and it starts to deflate... ... just as the HEADLIGHTS of a car pull into the driveway. Deacon FREEZES. He desperately tries to cover himself with the rapidly diminishing toy being jerked away by the dog in a motion that makes it look like Deacon's getting a doggie hummer. A MAN gets out of the car.You know how long it's going to take to save up for a car selling porno tapes twenty bucks a pop? Fred looks down.What?You're kidding me, right? Tell me you're kidding.Great. So now we've got no girls, no car, and no money.I'm sorry. There's nothing we can do for a while. We don't have anything new.Hey, Naomi. What are you up to?Oh. I could help you. I mean, if you needed any help.She went to Paris with the French Club. We're seeing other people. She laughs at his attempt at being nonchalant. But she's laughing with him, not at him, and Deacon can tell the difference. He relaxes...Look, can you please stop calling me that? I think we're old enough to just let it go. All right?Look, mom. I need a car.I need a car of my own.Jesus, Mom. I'm seventeen now. I think I can handle it.Shut up. I figured out how to get back on the Tony Montana track.... So, I'm at the zoo today... EXT. ZOO - DAY A crowd of people are watching something in the monkey cage.And these monkeys are doing it. I mean, they're going wild. And Miss Ariel is videotaping it.That's when it hit me. Just then, a glob of \"something\" shoots out towards the crowd . Everyone ducks, except for Roger, who's can't move quickly enough in his wheelchair. It hits him in the face, dripping down his orthodontia.Well, Roger actually... INT. FRED'S BEDROOM - DAYLet's make one.A movie.No, you moron. A porno film. Fred lights up.And check this out. The best part of all, is I've got an angle.We can make pornos that cater to guys like us.Yes. Adult films made by virgins for virgins.Right. No shots of sweaty guys' faces.No, Matt. We'll shoot it on your video camera. We're not getting any expensive equipment.I don't know. We'll surf the net. We'll figure it out. They look at each other for a beat. Finally, Fred and Matt crack up.What?I'm serious about this.Do you have any idea how much money we'd make? A beat.Enough for a car. Enough for more camera shit. To take girls out. I don't know. For whatever we want. Beat. Beat. Beat. They're thinking about it.It's a free market transaction between consenting adults. What's the problem?Guys, tell me the truth. Haven't you ever wondered... haven't you ever imagined what it would be like to make one?Look. This is an opportunity we shouldn't let slip away. If we make this movie, it could be the best year of our lives. We'll go in boys and come out men. And at the end, we'll have the money, the power, and the women. But you losers would rather play it safe. Well, I'm not going to waste another minute. I'm making this porno movie with or without you. And when I show up at school in my new set of wheels, and you two limp dicks are begging me for my sloppy seconds, I'll just have to tell you, \"Sorry, guys. That ship has sailed. You blew it.\" Ringing silence.Thanks.No, Matt.How much money do we need?Yes, Matt.No, Matt. A NURSE walks in.Then whose name should we use? Just then, MR. GREITZER comes into the office.No way.And he'll never find out?Okay. Cool. The Nurse returns.What do you mean?Guys. Those kind of names are just for the actors.Okay, fine. Then I'm Sam ... Slam. Sam Slam. The Back Door Man. Matt and Fred look at each other, then Deacon.Sorry, Balls. I guess I'm still new at this.Yeah. 345 Remson. That's right. Great. Wednesday, three to five. Looking forward to working with you, too. He hangs up and returns to the kitchen to see the whole family staring at him, curious.I'm tutoring someone ... in math. To earn money for a car. He forces a smile. INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - DAY The guys are busy setting up auditions.No, we don't pay bus fare. JUMP CUT TO:We're ready. Over. Matt picks up his walkie talkie.Take a seat please.Don't worry. We're old enough.Okay, then. I think we have what we need. We'll call you. She's confused.No, I don't think that will be necessary at this time.I say we make them from Hawaii.It's perfect. Do you know what a Hawaii driver's license looks like?Exactly.Vacation. People from Cleveland vacation in Hawaii, where do you think people from Hawaii go? Matt and Fred look at each other. They shrug, then,Hey, mom. Can I borrow the car?But, mom. You said I could use the car, but it's never free.Out.Oh, yeah. He starts the ignition, and an EASY LISTENING tune blasts on the radio, ruining the moment. The guys look at each other for a beat, then Deacon quickly changes the station to a ROCKING SONG, and get back into the mood for adventure.Oh, yeah. They pull out and drive off. 49A EXT. CLEVELAND - NIGHT 49A The minivan descends out of the suburbs into the lights of the big city below. EXT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - NIGHT CLOSE ON the Aerostar's bumper sticker: \"My child is on the honor roll at William Wall High School.\"We're on business, he's on vacation. He hands the i.d.'s back.Sorry?Look. We have to get into this strip bar.Twenty-seven.We've got money. Deacon pulls out a wad of cash. The Bouncer looks around, then thinks about it for a second. INT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - NIGHT WE TRACK the guys as they slowly move down the dark corridor towards the light. Each guy is in his own little world, Matt and Fred following Deacon as he takes the first nervous steps. First the neon lights hit them, then the smell of liquor and sweat, the sounds of barroom chatter, and finally the grinding blast of MUSIC, so powerful it seems to stop them in their tracks. Their eyes bug out. SCANTILY-CLAD WAITRESS walking by. As they move further into the club, they see actual STRIPPERS soliciting lap dances and some TOPLESS DANCERS onstage. Fred smiles ear to ear. The guys are locked in a deep primordial trance, broken only by the voice of a COCKTAIL WAITRESS.Uh, same. She leaves.What's a seven and seven?To After School Special.Actually, we're filmmakers. We're here looking for new talent.Yeah, we're looking for some beautiful ladies looking to break into film. You interested?Look. We're paying top dollar, hetero only, no anal, and we're distributing through our web site.Aren't you? You know we're going to need two forms of i.d. to prove you're over eighteen.What are you guys doing?Will that work?It doesn't really have to be one of us, though, does it? He grabs the yearbook.What are you doing here?No.You can't prove anything.No, that's not a good idea.Forget it.Okay. I think we're ready here. Fred awkwardly picks up the boom and puts his earphones on.I guess so. They return to position.Close up.Close up.Not now, Fred. Jake. Jake comes out of the bathroom dressed as the yearbook editor.Jake, you okay?Come on, Jake. We're filming.Um, okay. Ashley, maybe you can help him out. She grabs his joint and Jake freezes. He remains motionless, focusing every ounce of mental control on keeping the floodgates closed. Approximately one point three seconds later...Jake? What's happened? Jake, humiliated, runs to put on his shorts.Calm down, Jake. We can shoot this scene again. Just relax. We can splice it together.No way.No. You do it. A beat.Matt. Stop it.No. We can get someone else.Good issue. Beat.You ever think about getting into film? Way uncomfortable, the guy puts the magazine down and makes a beeline for the door.Where are you going, man? The guy is out the door. Deacon... EXT. JIM'S TINY MART - NIGHT ... runs after him.Don't you want to get it on with a sexy lady?!? Matt and Fred are sitting on the curb with some slurpies, bummed.Are you okay?Really? I didn't think you got embarrassed about anything. She smiles at Deacon, cheered up by the inadvertent compliment. The Bus HONKS for Deacon.Well, I guess I should go.What?Oh. He turns around and she changes her shirt behind him. Deacon can't help but sneak a peek.Yeah, I'm working on this project at home.Really?Okay. Cool. The bus HONKS for Deacon again. EXT. AQUARIUM PARK - DAY Matt and Fred charge forward on their 10-speeds through a park. They slide to a stop, falling off their bikes, but they're too excited to care. 65A INT. AQUARIUM - DAY 65A They rush up to Deacon, whose biology class is near the Beluga Whale tank.Matt, what's wrong?And?How many?A thousand?Holy shit! Deacon high-fives the other two. They're all stoked.Uh, I can't tonight guys.It's this thing I have to go to.No. Look, it's this party Naomi invited me to.Uh... Okay. I guess that's cool. An awkward beat.I want you guys to come. It's just, I don't know. I kind of had this vibe from Naomi.Yeah. Okay. That's cool. Look, it's at Mark and J.T. Slistak's house. I'll see you guys there. I've got to get back to class.So?No. There's someone else I'd rather see... He looks into her eyes, waiting to see if the limb he's out on is going to break. She smiles. It's working. Just then,What was that all about?Tell me about it.Well at least you were smart enough to dump him. I mean, you deserve someone who will treat you ... I don't know. Really well.I've been wanting to do that for a long time.Hey, where's Coop?Good one, Spock. I can't understand why you're not more popular with the ladies.Okay. Okay. All right already. He pulls off his shirt and approaches Ashley with a pizza box from out of nowhere.And maybe I could throw in the sausage for free. Deacon shows no enthusiasm for what's happening down below.S'up?Yeah. They said there's going to be a massive eruption next year. Fred starts laughing.What?What?What?Wait. Why do you want us to kiss?What? Deacon looks over at the camera. It's Ashley filming. PANIC! He slowly looks down at the person he and Fred are having sex with. He can barely look. It's Matt!Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh! CUT TO: INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Deacon bolts up out of bed. Nightmare. Thank God. INT. BASEMENT SET AS \"MOVIE THEATER\" - DAY Deacon enters and the scene looks very much like the dream: Ashley on the bed and Matt and Fred waiting around.Where the hell is Coop? There's no way I'm making out with Fred. Then Coop comes out of the bathroom and sees everyone staring at Deacon.Hang on. Relax. It was just this stupid dream I had.No. Well, yes. And we were both having sex with you. But it was just a dream so let's forget it. Everyone is a little uneasy at this admission. Deacon quickly changes the subject.What's with the light?Okay. Relax.Fine.Hey. Can I ask you a question? Fred shrugs. The memory of the nightmare is wreaking havoc with Deacon's conscience.Do you ever think maybe we've gotten ourselves in a little over our heads with all of this?Where is it?It's not working! Matt thinks about it for a second.Large load.Mom! Dad! What are you doing home?I, uh... Deacon's mind is racing. Then,Yes, my girlfriend.Their dates stood them up?Dad, don't. Let me take responsibility. We'll pay to have it fixed. Deacon's Dad looks at Ashley again. He can't hide his pride.I think Ashley's busy tonight--Isn't that funny? The doorbell rings.I'll get it.What are you doing here?Now's not a good time.Nothing. Let's talk later. He tries to close the door, but she stops it.Shut up, Max!I can explain. Naomi walks into the kitchen with Max.Are you insane? I've been fantasizing about Naomi Feldman since the seventh grade.So what should I do?Yeah, pretty much. He looks down.So, I guess this means you're not my girlfriend anymore.No, I don't think that's a good idea.Matt and Fred will get really mad. We're not supposed to tell anyone.No offense, but the female point of view doesn't really matter in these films. She looks at him, pouting.Okay. Okay. CLOSE ON a computer monitor displaying the A.S.S. Website. The cursor is clicking through the various pages: text stories, pictures of the set, still photos of Ashley and Coop, etc. But more importantly, the \"hits\" counter looks like the odometer on a rocket ship. PULL BACK to reveal...Naomi is my girlfriend.And I wanted her to help out. Give the script a female point of view. Fred pulls Deacon aside.What?Are you okay?Coop's the one that smacked her.Like what?Oh. Oh yeah. Of course.Of course I do.It's my first time.I don't know. It was weird. Is it supposed to be so weird?Of course I do.What are we doing here?I don't need any new clothes.Naomi. Wait. Stop. He stops her.I have to meet up with Matt and Fred this afternoon. I already blew them off yesterday.But what about Matt and Fred?What's going on? Are we going to find another girl? What?Yeah. About what?I know. I do, too.Okay. I know what this is about, guys. I'm sorry about Naomi.Then what is it?You don't understand. Fred cuts to the chase.Fine. Go ahead without me.Fine.I wanted to say I'm sorry.For blowing you guys off.No, it's not. It's just sometimes I feel like the whole world is passing us by and we're just sitting still. I don't know. Anyway, I'm sorry.Naomi and I did it the other night.No, it's true.Good. At first. But then I kept thinking about all the pornos. Trying to hit the right spots, positions. I don't know. After a while it kind of seemed like work.I don't know. Maybe we should just call it quits.What are you doing here?Well, actually we were--Rachael?Good. Good. How was France?So, how's John Baldwin? Rachael goes white.Everybody knows.You didn't?How does it look?Are you done with it?That was pretty gross.Take it easy, Fred.No. Matt's right. This movie was a mistake.Come on, Fred. Didn't you think this movie was going to be ... I don't know, sexy? Fred looks at the other two for a beat, not sure what to say. Finally, he smiles.The Aerostar's not so bad.Thanks.Congratulations. Deacon hugs her.Hang on, guys. I'll be right back. He leaves Fred and Matt alone with Ashley.I don't know. Good, I guess.Yeah. She was.I don't want to. I don't know. It's not like it was when I was with Rachael. Rachael and I used to talk about stuff. We just, I don't know, connected.What do you mean?Yeah, I guess I did. So I have to do this, don't I?There's something I want to talk to you about.I've been thinking. Maybe we should see other people.Well, I mean, we don't really have anything in common. And we don't really even get along.Listen to what I'm saying, Naomi.Yeah. I guess so.I won't. You can tell people you dumped me if you want.Sure. What do I care?Just don't tell anyone about the movies. All right? She smiles.No one's listening to you, Jake. Give it a rest. Jake gets down to confront the guys.The web site is in someone else's name. All our records are encrypted. There's no tracing it to us, jerk off.Did you make a copy of it?You sent the original tape to my parents?Jesus.Noted. Guys. We've got a problem. INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT A large envelope labelled \"OPEN ME\" sits with the unopened mail on the foyer table.Who the hell are you?Wait! Wait! Wait!We'll give you the website if you let us go. Vic looks at Mike for a second, then shrugs. Mike closes the hedge clippers and they untie the kids and let them down. Deacon pulls up his pants.Nothing.What except? There's no except!No, Matt!Guys!It's a minivan! It can't go that fast! EXT. STREET - NIGHT The car races down the street. INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT His mom approaches the Envelope and stack of mail. EXT. DEACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT They run up to the door and burst in. INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT Deacon runs in and eyes: AN EMPTY TABLE.No, I just--Mom, Dad...Wait--I can explain.If you'll just give me a chance...Is that what this is about? My biology class? It's just a stupid midterm grade.Mom, Dad. I'm seventeen now. I'm driving. I've got a girlfriend. Well, actually, we broke up. But you guys treat me like a kid. Is it too much to ask for to be a normal teenager with a normal life?No. Naomi. Look. I just want to have fun with my friends, okay? They look him over. Finally,I won't. Relieved, he walks out into the Foyer. Max appears from around the corner with the tape. They walk together.How much do you know?Done. Did you know all along?My advice is to go slow. If you feel you're losing control, just try to relax. Don't worry. It's easier than it looks. PULL BACK to reveal we're in INT. DMV - DAY Fred is about to take his driving test.This is for me?Thanks, guys. Really.Speak for yourself, guys.Yeah. But I think it worked out better this way.I thought I told you not to call me that anymore.Some people never learn. Matt pulls out a funky remote control. He hits a button and all the monitors come on up and down the hallway. Students stop to look up at them.You know, guys, I've been thinking about something.About how making the movie didn't turn out to be so fun. I think I figured out why. They stop at their lockers.Sex is like a comic book, still in the original wrapper. Once you open it up and read it, it loses its value.Exactly. The fun part about high school is unravelling the mystery of what's going to happen next. The guys smile and dial the combinations on their lockers. In the background, Jake is still on the ground crying. We TRACK through the hallway, outside... 121C EXT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY 121C ... where we see a large CAR TRANSPORT, with three hot new sports cars on it. Their license plates read \"JOHNNY H,\" \"SAM SLAM,\" and \"BALLS.\" TRACK OVER to Mike, unloading the cars and Vic, standing there smiling.

than that guy, so we should be able to get chicks as hot as her.It's a basic rule of porno. Finally, we REVEAL our three heroes: MATT, FRED, and DEACON. They're watching the porno... INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - A/V ROOM - DAY ... before school with the sound turned way down, but you can still hear the porno. The three guys are sitting with their book bags on their laps to conceal any possible bonerage.Deacon! What are you doing? I was watching that.First, I go to Yale, then Harvard law, then when I'm making a hundred grand a year, I'll have a whole stable of hot chicks sitting around topless on my yacht. He smiles ears to ear, looking for approval.What?What are you doing?So's my balls. See you later.Did you videotape it?You are the biggest moron I have ever known. Just then, Deacon comes up to them.Well, you had your chance. I told you to seal that deal.I'm biding my time.It doesn't get any better than that. You and Rachael were perfect for each other. And naked girls don't just appear out of thin air. \"I have a math test tomorrow.\"That's not going to be us this year, or next year, or any year, ever.So, we're going to become Cuban drug lords?Nothing's going to change, Deacon. You're still going to be the kid who shit his pants in fifth grade and no one will ever let you forget it.Oh, that's just not fair. Fred adjusts himself.Aaaaaahhhhhhhh! The Customers stop to stare at the scene. Fred breaks free, and Russ chases after him.At least you got this great party.Well, we did send out flyers to like three hundred people from school.What? Why didn't I hear about this? That shit's not right.Yeah. Tom Cooperman kicked me in the balls in third grade, and I swear there is still a footprint on my nutsack.Fine. Watch your balls.She looks good. And there's NAOMI, every teenage boy's fantasy, wearing a hot party dress and drinking a cup of beer. Someone lightly bumps her... CLOSE ON her lips as the beer dribbles down her chin, and the world goes still . She playfully wipes the beer off her moistened lips and chin with the back of her hand. She turns her head and her hair floats in the air.She spilled her beer.Your dignity?There's a small problem.I got fired yesterday. Russ caught me and went berserk. Some sort of sting operation he's been planning for months. I don't know.No. And now I have to work twice a week at my dad's office. I told you this Scarface plan was stupid.And no porn.Goddamn it.Hey, asshole. Don't just come barging in here. We could have been naked. Matt gives Fred a look.What?Even better.What kind of angle?You mean virgins.And cute, nice girls. The kind you'd want to take to dinner with your parents.And nothing up the butt. They look at him.What? I don't like it when they put stuff up their butt.How are we going to get the women to star in the film?That was really funny. Deacon just looks at them, pissed.Do you have any idea how much trouble we'd get in?What about the moral implications?We're not adults.Okay. Sure. I've thought about it. I've thought about shaving Principal Taggert's ass, too. A look, then Deacon gets up to seal the deal.Okay... So say we were to do this. What would we call our company?We've got to have two forms of i.d. to prove she's over eighteen.A first time porno actress makes only two fifty to five hundred bucks.We place an ad in the Cleveland X-Press for \"body models.\" That's like some sort of code word in the industry.Okay. In a minute. Fred puts the samples down. She rolls her eyes then leaves.We also need an adult signature to set up the bank account and the web site.Oh yeah, good idea. That'll never come back to haunt us.Why not? It's perfect. My dad's got Mr. Greitzer's signature on file, his credit card number, and his social security number... A beat.It's not like we're going to send him our annual report. It'll just be like an official name of record or something.And we need porno names.It's a basic rule of porno. All people affiliated with the production of an adult film have porno names so their friends don't recognize them.Exactly. That's a good one. I'll be Balls McLongcock.You don't get it, do you? A porno name needs to be a very subtle thing. Fred gestures and DROPS the samples which SPLATTER all over the ground.Matt, pick that up. INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT The family dinner.Sure, you can bring your dog. Oh. No, that's okay. Better leave him home. JUMP CUT TO:I can't believe this is working. INT. BASEMENT SET - OTHER ROOM - DAY And there's Matt, wearing a shirt and tie, nervously sitting in the rec room with a room full of CRACK WHORES. They're a motley crew of fat, old, toothless, spandex-wearing streetwalkers . An uncomfortable silence pervades the room. Matt turns to one woman wearing a rainbow-colored halter top.Hi, I'm Balls McLongcock and this is Sam Slam.Tequila. Nice name. So, have you done any films before?Maybe later. INT. DEACON'S BASEMENT - LATER The whores are gone.There's got to be another way to recruit porno actresses. INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - NIGHTBut isn't it going to seem a little suspicious? Like why are we in Cleveland?This is the new style, Mr. Lewis.Are we really going to do this?Right. Of course. We just moved to Hawaii a few months ago. Haven't picked up the local lingo yet. They force smiles and wait for the answer...Thanks! The Bouncer closes the door on them. Busted.Thirty-five.Huh? Oh. I'll have a scotch. Straight up. On the rocks.Okay? She takes Fred's hand and walks him over to a private dance couch. As the next SONG starts, a curtain lowers around Fred and the Stripper. Fred is a little freaked out.Uh, not right now, thank you. I have to go to the bathroom. He tries to get up, but the Stripper stop him.Okay. She sits down on Fred's lap. Right on his boner.Uhhhhh.Then you're hired.We came up with a great idea. We're going to presell the videos by posting the scripts on the website.One thing, though. If our motto is \"by virgins, for virgins,\" I was thinking we should put a picture of one of us on the web site to sort of sell the image.We don't know what you're talking about. Jake takes some pages off the printer.Are you crazy?It's a lot harder than it looks.What? Deacon pushes him over to position.Are we actually going to do this? They look over at Ashley. She's waiting.I need a bathroom break.My arm's getting tired.Can I put down the boom?What?You.Oh, like you're the only one who can do that.Matt! They huddle again, worried about whether to go on with this.Look, guys. Maybe we should just pay Ashley and chalk this up to a failed experiment.Who? CUT TO: INT. JIM'S TINY MART - NIGHT CLOSE ON the cover of \"T&A Enthusiast\" magazine. RISE UP to reveal a twenty-something MAN thumbing through the issue.Oh, I've got it. What if the Math Team Captain is in detention for something...Yeah, and the cheerleader is in there and she's going to get grounded if she fails one more test... As they talk, Fred types away. EXT. INDIA - DAY STOCK FOOTAGE: Taj Mahal, etc. INT. TEEN BOY'S BEDROOM - BHOPAL, INDIA - NIGHT A NERDY INDIAN BOY is totally engrossed in the After School Special Website. His eyeglasses reflect the glow of the scrolling text of Fred and Matt's current script.Our site got linked by another bigger site. Someone must have seen our stories and liked them.Twelve thousand.We need to hurry up and make this movie.Why? Where are you going?We're not really going to the party, you moron.Because I said so. Matt starts getting agitated.All right. All right. Stop crying already. We'll make an appearance.We can't really talk about it.He was supposed to be here a half hour ago.Are you sure?Hey.How's it going? Deacon shrugs.Hey, did you see that show on Sci Fi about sun spots?You said \"massive eruption.\" Deacon starts laughing, too.Sorry.All right. Fred goes in to kiss Deacon, who's thoroughly confused. Deacon holds him back with his hand.No way. I'm holding the mike and that's it.Come on. Let's do it already.How's Naomi?Fire! The coiled cord to the massive light is burning a circular hole in the smouldering carpet.Run! Ashley and Coop run up the stairs. Fred isn't far behind.Mine has mono. From too much making out. With me.What is she doing here?Jesus, Deacon. Didn't you see that Beatles documentary on the History Channel? You're pulling a Yoko Ono on us.Fine. Whatever. Let's get started. I'm sure she'll be really helpful. Coop comes out of the bathroom dressed as the Math Team Captain, complete with nerd glasses, pocket protector, etc.Who cares, Naomi?Where are you going?Now what are we going to do? Your \"girlfriend\" ruined everything.Who asked you?Every two minutes, they change positions. He pauses, and cocks his head in confusion. He tries to shake Fred's voice out of his head, but he can't.It's a basic rule of porno. Finally, he gives in to the porno music. He rolls Naomi on top of him. JUMP CUT TO: They're doing it standing up against the door.The door. Always a classic. JUMP CUT TO: Deacon sweeps away all the stuff from her desk and lifts her up on it. Naomi likes it.It's a basic rule of porno. JUMP CUT TO: Back on the bed, Naomi is in a state of complete bliss, having had her first ever orgasm.Matt and I have been talking.No, Deacon. We want to make the movie we wrote. We want to make it without you.That's not the problem, Deacon.I thought this was about us having fun and doing something crazy together. But as soon as you got what you wanted, you blew us off.Do you even like her? Deacon is about to tell them. Then,Fine. Matt and Fred get up and leave.So, what did you want to talk to us about?For what?You know, you can be a real dick sometimes. Then, Fred smiles. Deacon knows they're cool with each other.You're kidding, right?How was it?So what now? Do we make this thing?What?So...?So what's the problem?Why not?Great. I knew it. I knew you couldn't handle this. Matt looks away.No, I knew that when it came down to it, Matt would wuss out. Matt snaps.Shut up, Matt. Matt stands up and gets in Fred's face.Why don't you make me? The two square off, staring each other down. Until,What are you talking about? This whole thing was your idea.How long have you guys known about the bathroom thing? Deacon laughs.I don't know. I thought you guys were having fun. I didn't want to be the wuss. A beat.So what about the car?What about the money and the power and the women? What about Tony Montana?Hey, Ashley. Can I ask you a question?Do you think me and Matt will ever get girlfriends?Thanks.What?!? The guys freak out, but Mike's gun keeps them in place.Why me? It was all Deacon's idea!We've got orders from all over the world.Except...Except you promise to supply us with quality porn free of charge.It could come in handy. I mean, until we get girlfriends.Dude?Oh yeah. I've been there. INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - PARENTS' BEDROOM - DAY Deacon's mom is showering, but the door to the bathroom is open. Fred wanders into the bedroom.Deacon? Are you in here? INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHTGood name.Hurry!Too bad we burned the film. You could have submitted it as your sample.So, I guess we all got what we deserved. No money, no power, no women.No, I don't. She's disappointed. The whole gang hangs their heads. Then,Matt knows a thing or two about pleasuring women. I know everything. Fred smiles ear to ear.

You guys are filmmakers?Aren't you kind of young?I'm eighteen. Don't worry.Don't worry. You guys relax and have a few drinks. By the time the night's over, you'll know I'm your girl.Okay.Uh huh. Hey, did you guys shave or something? Deacon looks at the other two, all three now beardless.Okay.These yearbook photos of the Debate Club are making me so hot. I can't help myself. THROUGH MATT'S VIDEO DISPLAY, Ashley slowly strips off her clothes. But before we get too good a look, weI hope no one catches me because I forgot to lock the door. Oh, yeah. Oh, God, yeah. FRED's smile turns into nervous ogling. DEACON crosses his legs and adjusts his shorts. MATT wipes a bead of sweat from his brow. Deacon whispers,What? Did I so something wrong? Matt is quivering.I couldn't help myself. Please don't tell the principal.So's his.That's it?I can see that. Fred snickers and Jake gives him the evil eye.Aaaahhhh!Me? How did you ... without even getting hard first?Now what? The guys regroup, away from Ashley. The moment of truth: How far are they willing to go?Maybe I can pay for the pizza some other way... We hear Deacon's ZIPPER opening offscreen as Deacon rolls his eyes and reluctantly delivers his line:Deacon is talking about making out with Fred.If you guys want to do gay porn, you still have to pay me.This summer tent-pole event-movie is making me so scared.I'm Deacon's girlfriend. Ashley. MRS. LEWIS MR. LEWIS * His girlfriend? His girlfriend? *We were having a make out party.Okay. Oh, shit.Johnson sounds like a moron.Nineteen. But I tell people eighteen. Deacon laughs nervously.Hi.Eighteen.Let her go.Fantasy and reality are two different things, Deacon. Don't fall in love with who you think she is. You have to be sure you love the real person.Go after her then. Or don't. Whatever. He looks at Ashley for a beat, then goes after Naomi. EXT. STREET - NIGHT Naomi and Deacon are arguing under a street light.Yeah, but if you can break into films, like these ones, you can get featured dancing gigs and make ten times that much.Seriously. If these guys ever get their act together. Matt stumbles in carrying a pile of scripts. Fred walks in behind him and sees Naomi.This quadratic equation is so hard.I'm out of here.Look. This is ridiculous. Who does dress rehearsals for a porno shoot?Guys, I appreciate the money. It's nice to get paid for sitting around doing nothing, but this isn't helping my career. I've got no footage for my reel. She packs up.Sorry. She leaves.Mrs. Lewis!I, um, I'm... I'm going where you're going.Yes. Exactly.It's my first time.is essentially folded in half, her legs pinned well beyond her ears. She's obviously been in this position before. INT. YOGA CLASS - LATER The women are gathering their things after class, some still eyeing Ashley jealously.Yeah, people tell me that all the time. You know, I could teach you some of those moves. Mr. Lewis would love it.Uh huh.Uh huh.Um, no.Listen, Mrs. Lewis. You don't have to worry about Deacon. He's a good kid. If you just let him make his own mistakes in life, he's going to turn out fine. INT. NAOMI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Deacon and Naomi are under the covers, making out.Fantasy and reality are two different things. JUMP CUT TO:Fantasy and reality are two different things... But Deacon doesn't share Naomi's contentment. He looks troubled. 83A INT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT 83A The next night, Deacon is talking to Ashley backstage as she's getting ready to go on.Of course it was weird. True love can only exist between two women. Deacon is stunned.Just kidding. I don't know, Deacon. Do you like this girl? He hesitates a bit too long.Your heart is telling you that you don't. And I think it's time you start listening to your heart. Deacon still doesn't get it.Look. I have to go on. Just do whatever you want. Or don't. Whatever.You, too, are someone whose kitchen I've never been in. Another beat, then she grabs the bill out of his teeth, and quickly moves away. INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT Dad walks upstairs, still a little stunned.Hey, guys. Ashley walks up to them. She looks hotter than ever, in a tiny midriff shirt and short shorts.I need you.I need you to make this movie. For my reel.Ooh, look. An eyelash. For the third time, time stands still as Ashley gently pulls the errant eyelash from Deacon's eye and offers it up to him.Make a wish. Deacon is too entranced to close his eyes, but he does take the opportunity to blow the eyelash off her hand. She smiles and brushes back a strand of hair from his brow. The guys are hooked. Up through the window, over on Deacon's computer, the A.S.S. Website is running, featuring Roger's smiling face with the motto, \"By Virgins, For Virgins.\" The counter is on fire. INT. HAIRDRESSER - DAY Roger is getting his hair cut by a cute HAIRDRESSER, his wheelchair next to him. A few other women are in the back, whispering and looking over at Roger. An OPERA ARIA plays on the radio.But what about the capital gains?Hey, guys. I hope you don't mind, Plantain and Baxter want to be in the movie, too.Ira, I have something important to tell you.This prom is making me so hot. I'm ready to lose my virginity to you tonight.That was the best prom ever.Hey, guys. Great party.I've got some big news. I sent the reel to Vivid and they want to fly me and Coop to L.A. to talk about a contract.Sure.Are you kidding? Come on, guys. You have it made. You're smart, funny, fun to be with. In a couple of years, girls will be dying to meet men like you.Well, no. Popular, good looking guys always get the girls. Hey, what was I supposed to say? Then, Roger wheels by, arm in arm with his Hairdresser. No more braces and headgear, Roger looks sharp with slicked back hair and suave clothes.Let me tell you something about Deacon. That boy is amazing in bed.Ashley. Deacon's ex.Seriously. Have your boyfriends ever given you an orgasm?Have you ever felt so completely satisfied in bed that you just wanted to sleep for a week?You're wasting your time giving those Neanderthals blowjobs. I mean, they'll probably wind up unemployed wife beaters anyway.Matt and Fred? I don't think so. But if you're interested, you better move fast. Those guys know how to do this thing ... She whispers something to Wendy and Kelly. They look shocked. Ashley walks off... 100A EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT 100A ...and finds Deacon, sitting alone on a broken-down ride. She sits down next to him.How's Naomi?I thought she was your fantasy girl.You're gonna dump her.Very good, Deacon. Deacon is confused.Oh, nothing. I guess I'm just glad that you finally figured it out. A moment of realization.I guess. Or not. Whatever. Deacon smiles. He finally understands that Ashley really does care about him. Ashley kisses him on the cheek and exits off into the horizon. EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT Deacon holds Naomi's hand and they walk and talk.", "clean_line": "hi ashley guys filmmakers aren kind young eighteen worry worry guys relax drinks time night ll know girl okay uh huh hey guys shave deacon looks beardless okay yearbook photos debate club making hot help matt video display ashley slowly strips clothes good look wei hope catches forgot lock door oh yeah oh god yeah fred smile turns nervous ogling deacon crosses legs adjusts shorts matt wipes bead sweat brow deacon whispers wrong matt quivering couldn help tell principal fred snickers jake gives evil eye aaaahhhh getting hard guys regroup away ashley moment truth far willing maybe pay pizza way hear deacon zipper opening offscreen deacon rolls eyes reluctantly delivers line deacon talking making fred guys want gay porn pay summer tent pole event movie making scared deacon girlfriend ashley mrs lewis mr lewis girlfriend girlfriend having party okay oh shit johnson sounds like moron nineteen tell people eighteen deacon laughs nervously hi eighteen let fantasy reality different things deacon fall love think sure love real person looks ashley beat goes naomi ext street night naomi deacon arguing street light yeah break films like ones featured dancing gigs times seriously guys act matt stumbles carrying pile scripts fred walks sees naomi quadratic equation hard look ridiculous dress rehearsals porno shoot guys appreciate money nice paid sitting isn helping career ve got footage reel packs sorry leaves mrs lewis um going going yes exactly time essentially folded half legs pinned ears obviously position int yoga class later women gathering things class eyeing ashley jealously yeah people tell time know teach moves mr lewis love uh huh uh huh um listen mrs lewis worry deacon good kid let mistakes life going turn fine int naomi bedroom night deacon naomi covers making fantasy reality different things jump cut fantasy reality different things deacon share naomi contentment looks troubled int pretty kitty club backstage night night deacon talking ashley backstage getting ready course weird true love exist women deacon stunned kidding know deacon like girl hesitates bit long heart telling think time start listening heart deacon look want kitchen ve beat grabs teeth quickly moves away int deacon house upstairs hallway night dad walks upstairs little stunned hey guys ashley walks looks hotter tiny midriff shirt short shorts need need movie reel ooh look eyelash time time stands ashley gently pulls errant eyelash deacon eye offers wish deacon entranced close eyes opportunity blow eyelash hand smiles brushes strand hair brow guys hooked window deacon website running featuring roger smiling face motto virgins virgins counter int hairdresser day roger getting hair cut cute hairdresser wheelchair women whispering looking roger opera aria plays radio capital gains hey guys hope mind plantain baxter want movie ira important tell prom making hot ready lose virginity tonight best prom hey guys great party ve got big news sent reel vivid want fly coop talk contract sure kidding come guys smart funny fun couple years girls dying meet men like popular good looking guys girls hey supposed roger wheels arm arm hairdresser braces headgear roger looks sharp slicked hair suave clothes let tell deacon boy amazing bed ashley deacon ex seriously boyfriends given orgasm felt completely satisfied bed wanted sleep week wasting time giving neanderthals blowjobs mean ll probably wind unemployed wife beaters matt fred think interested better fast guys know thing whispers wendy kelly look shocked ashley walks ext amusement park night finds deacon sitting broken ride sits naomi thought fantasy girl gonna dump good deacon deacon confused oh guess glad finally figured moment realization guess deacon smiles finally understands ashley care ashley kisses cheek exits horizon ext amusement park night deacon holds naomi hand walk talk"}}}
