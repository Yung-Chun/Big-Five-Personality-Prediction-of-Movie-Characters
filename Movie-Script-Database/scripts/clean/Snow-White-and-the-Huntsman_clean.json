{"Snow-White-and-the-Huntsman": {"ERIC": {"raw_line": "Once upon a time, in deep winter, a Queen was admiring the falling snow when she saw a rose blooming in defiance of the cold. The rose looks miraculously red. Nearby, a RAVEN looks on. The Queen gazes at the flower, then bends down.Reaching for it, she pricked her finger and three drops of blood fell. BOOM -- with the impact of an artillery shell, a DROP OF BLOOD lands in the snow. Followed by ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. The Queen startles, then calmly touches her stomach.And because the red seemed so alive against the white, she thought, if only I had a child as white as snow, lips as red as blood, hair as black as a raven's wings and all with the strength of that rose. A beat, then we hear the piercing cry of a new-born baby --Soon after, a daughter was born to the Queen and was named \"Snow White.\" With a radiant smile, the Queen offers SNOW WHITE to her proud father, KING MAGNUS. The baby's CRIES grow louder as the King cradles her gently in his arms, turning towards a mirror.The next winter was the harshest in memory and Snow White's mother passed away. Ba EXT. GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY. 8a The garden is covered in snow but there is no red rose now. King Magnus walks with his arm around Snow white, heartbroken. A single tear rolls down Snow White's cheek. Palace onlookers and mourners, fixed on her face, feeling what she feels, move aside.A year went by but the King was inconsolable. Taking advantage of his grief, dark forces gathered on the kingdom's borders.The unholy army was defeated, leaving King Magnus with the spoils of victory. A CAGED PRISON WAGON. Odd. Not even sure how it got there. King Magnus moves toward it, with a little trepidation. When he's close he gets off his horse, walks closer and dares to look inside.So struck by her beauty was the King, that he forgot, for the first time, his broken heart. His gaze is so intense that Ravenna looks down for a moment. When she lifts her head --The spell Ravenna's mother placed on her gave her the ability to steal youth and beauty, and indeed all things good, for her own evil purposes. But for every life there must be a death, for every gain, loss, and under the reign of Ravenna nature turned on itself and people turned on each other.Lay a hand on her and I'll take your head! BROCH turns and sees the huntsman with his hatchet raised.Won't take much courage to split your skull from here.Don't worry, somebody else will.Your eyes are dim.After all the business we've done together? Rose curses behind her gag as Eric pulls her away.I'll peddle my wares elsewhere, thank you. The slave merchant sees his prize disappearing and calls out:I have it right here in my pocket. If you'll just help me up. Eric holds his hand out. Broch walks over, suspicious. When he's close, Eric grabs his arm and kicks with both feet in Broch's chest. Broch flies back, then strides to Eric and kicks him in the side. Hurts.Actually, I seem to have drunk it all. You're welcome to it when it comes out again. Broch hauls him back up to his feet. He takes a swing but somehow the drunken Eric dodges the blow, swinging back at him. Everyone has come out of the Inn to enjoy the fight. Eric lands a body blow to Broch, who doubles over. Eric comes in for the kill, winds up and swings - Missing Broch but hitting a HORSE on the ass. It kicks its legs, sending him flying. He lands in a heap and drops his head back. Hands lift him and -- Drop him in a horse trough. He's underwater for a few seconds before he comes to and lifts out his head, eyes still closed.Royalty. That explains it.Can't you see I'm having a bath?Then he's dead -Then she is certainly dead.I've been to the Dark Forest enough times to know I'm not going back.Coin's no good to me if I'm lying dead with crows picking at my eyes. Ravenna steps off her throne now, approaching him.Why is her life of such value?I'll determine what concerns me, thank you. She smiles, moves even closer to him.And if I refuse? Ravenna nods to the Guards, who pull their swords. Dying to cut him to pieces. Eric eyes them, then looks to her and, in complete honesty --Do me the favor. I beg of you.My wife is none of your concern. Something about her face, the fact that she enjoys his hand on her throat makes Eric queasy. He releases his grip, stares right at Ravenna.Nothing will bring her back. Ravenna moves even closer, looks him right in the eye. She is incredibly persuasive as she says --Death is everywhere.It's not something I counted.Too bad. You'll need one. He stops his horse and nods.Do exactly as I do. Eric carefully places one foot after the next on grassy stepping stones that disappear into the bog as soon as his full weight is on them. The others catch on and follow, stepping on stones of their own. Once they're across the bog and onto dry land Finn takes a step forward but Eric grabs his arm.Exactly as I do. Eric puts a cloth to his face, gesturing for Finn and his guards to do the same and moves forward through the mushroom field - pops of pollen misting all around them. Eric stops, bends down, spotting faint FOOTPRINTS in the dew. He walks faster now, Finn watching in admiration.Pay them no mind. One of the Guards leans over a pool of water to drink when he sees a GHOSTLY REFLECTION gazing back at him. He stares in surprise, leaning closer. Suddenly a BARBED TAIL shoots out of the water -- skewering him -- and drags him into the depths. The others turn as they hear a scream but there's no sign of their companion now, just the bubbling water. Only Finn looks unconcerned. Eric stops senses something, holds up a hand. Then darts ahead, leaving them flat-footed. Finn makes a decision to follow and waves for his Guards to go ahead of him. They reluctantly follow Eric.Sure she is.What do you intend to do with her?Shut up! -I said, shut up! He puts his knife to her throat to quiet her.Who are you? What the hell's going on?Why does the Queen want you dead?Then what makes you so damn valuable?Away from you, love. You're trouble.The Duke? I've seen sheep with more fight in them. Desperate, she takes a chance.Just for argument's sake. How much?Well,it's a long way, through the forest, and that... that's a dangerous road, I couldn't even consider it for less than thirty gold pieces...Who are you? She looks at him levelly.I don't trust you Billy Goat.I still don't trust you.We'll stay the night here.I don't recall a question.Queen. Mountains. Dark Forest. Here. Past. There's a village. She takes the stick, points to a different spot in the dirt.You'll go where I take you.You're rather demanding, and not all that endearing, you know?I'll deliver you to safety m' lady.I swear . Constantly. It's one of my better qualities. She's not sure what to make of this, but...I've seen far stranger things in here. She sits, looks to Eric. Something's been bothering her.They'd be foolish to. Few survive. Good news/bad news. She looks around.We passed it a few miles back. He opens his flask and takes a healthy pull.I wouldn't do that if I were you. Not unless you want your bowels to rip apart. She turns. Eric has been snoozing on a rock, with one eye open. She releases the water, stands and faces off with Eric, who offers his flask of mead. She reluctantly takes a sip, spits most of it out, hands it back. He smells something, walks a few steps, bends down and examines a long brown pellet shaped object on the ground.A fumee.You want me to call it by another name? He doesn't need to. It's an animal dropping. Snow White winces as he kneads it between his fingers and takes a long sniff.Stay here. He moves away, though the trees, tracking prey. He hears the wind call his name...Sara?...Am I dreaming?Sara, I'm so sorry. Forgive me, please forgive me. Give me peace. Sara... He takes another step toward her and -- Buckles - THWACK! Snow White hits him behind his knees with a piece of wood. He hits the ground and she drags him away. He fights back and she jumps on top of him, staring right into his face.A name you'll not mention again. He tosses a knife to her. She's surprised but catches it.Feel its weight. One hand to the other. She shakes her head but does so.Now hold it - business end pointed at me.Which is your lead foot?Now stay back. You're too small to attack. You have to parry; use your opponents strength against him. Raise your opposing forearm. She does. He comes closer.With it you block and deflect an opposing thrust. You'll lose meat but you won't die from it. Wait until I'm close. He steps forward.Not yet. Watch my hands, not my eyes. He moves even closer.Not yet. Not until you can feel my breath. He moves right up to her.Now. Their faces are inches apart.This close. Drive it through me. To the hilt. Now look in my eyes.There's a lot you need to learn lass. Eric backs away.Keep that. She nods, now-focused on him in a way other than as an instructor. He turns and walks away.Fumee.It can't be this easy. He quietly unsheathes a hatchet.Uh-huh.Troll! Eric and Snow White are SLAMMED off the bridge and land in the shallow creek below -- among the CARCASSES OF SLAIN ANIMALS. The troll roars and comes after them, swinging its giant stone fists. Eric grabs Snow White and runs -- As the troll catches up with them, Eric shoves her out of the way and draws his hatchets.Run! Snow White turns and flees. Eric runs at the Troll. He ducks as a mighty arm sweeps over him, darts between the troll's legs, and hacks at its leg with his hatchets. The Troll falters a bit then -- A swinging stone fist catches him and hurls him across the creek. Snow White looks back to see Eric lying stunned on the ground, his wound bleeding again, at the troll's mercy. She hesitates, still terrified, then runs back. The Troll towers over the huntsman. It raises its stone hands to crush him when -- Snow White arrives -- SCREAMING LIKE A BANSHEE! The Troll looks around in surprise. So does Eric. A beat, then the monster turns away from Eric, striding towards SnowI told you to run.Thank you.Which are you?We're fugitives from the Queen. Snow White steps forward into the light.Where are the men?I don't know, but keep smiling. A beautiful LITTLE GIRL, LILY, moves away from her friends and offers her hand. Snow White stops, looks down at the girl, trying not to stare at her scar. 90-93a OMITTED 90-93a 93b EXT. BANKS OF THE LAKE/ FENLAND VILLAGE - DAY. 93b Eric sits by the lake, ANNA bandaging his wounds.I've had worse jobs. And anyway, she's not that heavy.What do you mean? He looks over.Who is she?Why didn't you tell me? She stops. She knows.Because I'd think it too fell a task? You'd be right. She looks at him. Shakes her head.Here.I've carried it a long time.Gristle from a stag's heart.The stag's the most timid animal in the forest but there's a bone in it's heart that gives it courage in it's hour of need and makes it the bravest in of all God's creatures. It's a protection charm.Take it. She does.It's getting dark. He walks away.Aye I know the truth. And that's exactly why she should be as far from me as possible.Trust me. I'm the last thing she needs. I'm bad luck. Everything I've ever cared about was destroyed.People have made that mistake before. He heads off into the night.Come on!I led them there. I am to blame. Snow White looks at him with empathy. He's in pain, too.I will take you to Duke Hammond's. Snow White slowly nods. Eric lies back and looks up at the sun flickering through the trees. It dances on his face and then -- A HUGE SHADOW blots out the light. Before he can react, fists and boots lay into him. As he protects his face, we catch glimpses of brutal figures in battle masks. Eric kicks a couple of them away, but more of them swarm over him, pinning him down in leg locks and choke holds. Snow White is treated just as roughly, powerful arms and legs pinning her down. She bites one of her captors and he twists her arms behind her back. A noose is slung around Eric's ankles and he's hauled up - hanging upside down. Snow White, also tied up, sits on the ground beside him. A line of DWARVES stand before them and pull up their grotesque BATTLE MASKS. The dwarf leader, Beith glowers.Come on, Beith! Is this how you treat a friend? The dwarf leader, BEITH, glowers.I tried to collect the bounty on their heads. A few times.But there's always tomorrow.It is your lucky day, Beith. I've got enough gold to keep you in ale for a year. Cut me down and I'll -- NION, Beith's right hand man and a fervent dwarf supremacist, clips Eric around the ear.It's hidden. Back there, in the woods. A short distance. They get the reference, don't like it. Nion slaps Eric again.Just tell me what I've done wrong?I saved this girl from the Queen. Out of the goodness of my heart. Snow White gives him a look. He calms her with a look of his own.People change.We don't need their help.That's more than you offered me?!Those are the Queen's men, Beith, better decide quickly.You were saying?Ah, a short cut. All 8 dwarf heads spin at him - pissed off. Enough with the short jokes. Nion raps Eric's knee with the flat of his dagger.Owww!!! Gus cuts Snow White loose.Legend has it dwarves were created to uncover all the riches hidden on earth. Not just gold and precious stones, but the beauty in people's hearts.Ask me, they've lost the art if they ever had it. When the Queen seized their mines she stole their treasure but more than that she stole their pride. And as if to prove it, GORT and NION sing and share from a flask of rum before they tumble to the ground-near Muir as the song ends. Eric notices the tumble and chuckles.Nothing half-wit.What do you say, we let bygones be bygones?I'm not sure, Beith. If I had any sense I'd have abandoned her long ago. Beith eyes Eric as he watches Snow White dance.What are you talking about?What?!How do you know her name?! Eric is shocked, desperate.Who is this? Beith is about to reply when William answers for himself.What is the Duke's son doing riding with the Queen's men?Why?The princess is well protected as you can see.The man who got her this far your lordship.You'll have to wait for your voice to break before you give me orders - William draws his sword in indignation and Eric draws his axe.Anyone can draw steel, boy. It takes a man to use it. William is about to react when Snow White turns...And I you. William looks over to where Snow White is.You'd be blind not to.We'll get her to the castle. Don't worry about that..Not telling someone how you feel and living with the regret is a lot worse.Here you are. Where it ends. Dressed Up to pretty. He takes another pull from the flask.Like you're asleep; about to wake-up and give me more grief. Am I right? The he touches her arm. Feels the fabric of her funeral dress. Looks at her face and breaks a bit - losing the drunken swagger and speaking with her as if she was still alive.You deserved better. And then he answers her...She was my wife, princess. That was your question that went unanswered. Sara was her name. When I came back from the wars I carried with me the stench of death and the anger of the lost. I wasn't worth saving. But she did so anyway. I loved her more than anything or anyone. And then I let her out of my sight and she was gone and I became myself again. A self I never cared for. Until you. You remind me of her. Her spirit. Her heart. And now you, too, are gone. You both deserved better. And I'm sorry to have failed you as well.You will be a Queen in heaven now... He leans down and kisses her lips.And sit among the angels. He finally turns and leaves the chamber, tossing the flask aside, disgusted with himself. As we listen to his footsteps fade we hold on Snow White's beautiful face. For a long time she stays perfectly still,Open the gate.Keep your money.Back from the dead and instigating the masses.Only if you have need of a brutish soldier. She smiles, moved. He turns his horse to full back, but before he leaves...You look fetching in mail. A bugle sounds and --Kill her! 209b INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - DAY. 209b Snow White braces herself and promptly follows Ravenna into the mirror room. Now Snow White is exactly where Ravenna wants her to be. The two women circle each other like heavyweight boxers.As for the huntsman... Eric goes under the village arch, back toward the forest.He returned to the forest where he", "clean_line": "time deep winter queen admiring falling snow saw rose blooming defiance cold rose looks

The King watches Snow White, hiding his sorrow behind a smile. So does the Queen, holding back her tears.You're so beautiful... Ravenna snaps to and looks into the face of Snow White, reverential, standing a few feet away. Ravenna's face softens as she looks at the face of Snow White. Ravenna beckons to her with a look and then holds out her arm - \"Come.\" As Snow White steps forward, the handmaidens withdraw until only one is left, weaving beautiful flowers in Ravenna's hair.You did?Why?... Ravenna doesn't answer, just stands and walks away.Hello?... What's your name? Rose, sitting in a dark corner, goes to her cell bars and looks out.The Duke?! He's alive?! He still fights in my father's name?! Rose stares at the feral girl now, realizing who she is.William? What about William?! The Duke's son?! Is he alive?!Rose?... The Guard clangs the cell door shut and walks away. Snow White peers through the shadows. Can't quite make her out.Rose?...You've never come in before.I'm afraid of her.No. He can't help himself, reaches out and touches her arm.What does she want from me? His finger move from her hair to her cheek, stroking it gently, and then to her chest. With his free hand he reaches back for his dagger.Let me go!She's going to kill me! The Oueen! He ignores, keeps moving.Believe me! Her brother tried to cut out my heart. He stops, looks at her.I swear it. He somehow believes her. New game. Then...Him! He's the one! He came at me with a knife! Eric holds her tight, one arm around her neck.You can't trust him!He'll betray you -He'll kill us both -Get your hands off me. She draws his dagger. He backs off. Eyeball to eyeball:Get away.Get away from me.She wants us all dead. All of us-You should know. You're the one hunting me. He backs away. Paces.Where are you going?I need to get to the Duke's Castle. There's an army there. I'll be safe.Take me, you'll be rewarded. I'm valuable. Isn't that why you're here?You're dead if you return without me. And I'm dead if you leave me. He turns, exasperated with her.How much is enough? Eric \"reluctantly\" prices up the job.A hundred. Deliver me safe to the Duke. I give you my word.Maybe that's a question you should have asked the queen. Stand-off.Do we have a deal?I've given you my word. He spits on his hand. She puts out her hand. He shakes it.I don't trust you either. She wipes it on her skirt. Behind them, a commotion. They run off.You haven't answered me.Where are we going? He takes a stick, draws in the dirt.I'm going to the Duke's Castle. He grabs the stick back.You'll take me to the Duke's castle or I'll go alone.There's a reward that awaits you. There are noblemen there, an army.How much do you want? Eric considers this, not sure how or if to negotiate.Two hundred gold pieces. Do we have a deal? More, a lot more, than he was expecting.Swear it.Fine. He moves to a spot to lie down and gathers leaves. Snow White seeks her own spot and comes upon -- the RIB CAGE OF A DEAD DEER, a host of BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLIES feeding on its bones. She is shocked. Eric notices...Do you think... will they follow us?How far have you travelled into the Dark Forest?What is it?A what?She's not real! Not real! Do you hear me?! He does and calms. She gets off him and he sits up, fatigued by the experience. A low point for him. He reaches for his flask -- pours the last single drop into his mouth. All gone. He tosses it aside. A lost soul. Snow White watches him with some compassion. He catches her look, gets up and walks away. 83b EXT. DARK FOREST OPEN AREA - DAY 83b Snow White catches up.Who is she? The one you bargained for. The one that spoke to you. Who is Sara?What?Why are you?-- He lunges at her and she raises the blade.What do you mean?Why do I need to learn how to kill? He looks at her.Where are you going?What is it?Is this the end of the Dark Forest?How far to the Duke's castle? He ignores, follows tracks, then stops as he sees the STONE BRIDGE below -- LEADING OUT OF THE DARK FOREST. Snow White stares at it too, relieved. Beyond the bridge there are open fens. They hurry down together and start to cross the bridge. They're half way across WHEN SUDDENLY WE SEE THE STONES STARTIf I had you'd be dead. A \"thank you\" would suffice. It's clear he sees her in a different light. She stares back at him. Eric holds her gaze, struggling a bit, then...We mean you no harm.Why are they looking at me like that?She's beautiful. Lily smiles and runs off to play. Behind her Eric appears.These women... This place.. It's very peaceful. But it makes me very sad.That's not why. It's because I've never said the words. She looks at Lily playing.I'm not sure I believe it myself. I never felt like a.. Alone in a dark cell. For years. Fighting to cling to memories. What he looked like. Smelled like. The kind man with the big arms and the wonderful smiles.. To me.. he wasn't The King. He was my father. Eric doesn't know what to say. In time, he reaches in his pocket.What is it?What is it made of?Was it hers? It's the most honest and emotional he's been with her.Thank you, huntsman. He looks at the sky.She's so beautiful.What is it?We must help them! Anna sees Snow White fighting off Eric and shouts --Why did you come back?Is there no one you haven't wronged? Eric nods at her. \"You.\"Tell them the truth, huntsman. The youngest of the dwarves, GUS, is beaming at Snow White with his dirty teeth.Do you hate the Queen?My father was King Magnus. This carries weight with the group. Impressed.If you accompany us to the Duke's castle you will be paid handsomely.Your weight in gold. Each of you. The dwarves trade glances, literally sizing each other up.Both of us. Eric looks surprised by her loyalty. So do the dwarves. Suddenly Duir calls out:What is this place? The huntsman looks just as dazzled.Really?Thank you so much, sir.No. For before. For defending me.There were more of you?I'm so sorry.I'd be honored. Snow White gets up and dances with Gus as the song picks up.I don't mind at all, Gus. I haven't danced in a long, long while. She feels eyes on her - turns to see the huntsman watching her with a slight smile. She smiles back and breaks away.Do you mind, Gus?You've taught me to fight, surely I can teach you to dance. Eric trades a look with Beith, who nudges him on. Eric stands and they proceed to dance, with her teaching.Palms up, head straight, look me in the eyes. And... The huntsman moves better than you'd imagine. His face even softens as they both enjoy the dance. Beith looks on with a smile. 130a OMITTED 130aGus, no! Gus's axe stops inches from William's eyes. Snow White recognizes the young warrior, staring at him in surprise.I saw you at the village. William looks up at her, out of breath:Leave him, huntsman. He's our friend. He glares but his eyes glisten with tears. Snow White is still bowed over Gus's body, sobbing, mourning. The prayer chant ends. Nion spits with anger and walks away.You didn't.We were children, William. You're here now. They reach some steep rocks and Eric turns around, offering Snow White his hand. She takes it and he helps her up the slope. William looks on, feeling jealous. Beith follows Duir and Coll up to the summit of the hill, then looks at the surrounding peaks.Up here it's as if nothing's changed. The world looks beautiful again.It's strange, but... I feel only sorrow for her. William is taken aback by this but pushes on.It takes more than a name. I an not my father, William.How do I inspire? How do I lead men?That's not how I remember it.No... They gaze into each other's eyes, close enough to kiss.I remember we were always arguing. And fighting. And... She trails off, lost in his gaze. He stops, leans closer and kisses her gently. They stay like that a moment, then William pulls away, holding something in his hand. Snow White smiles as she sees that it's an APPLE. With a mischievous smile, William holds out the apple for Snow White, just like he did when they were children.I remember this trick.No, my lord. William, below, stares at her in joy while his father still looks dazed.I have rested long enough. Her voice is gentle but full of quiet conviction.I am ready to ride by your side, my lord, when you face the Queen in battle. The Duke looks speechless for a moment.That is all I thought to do when I escaped. But I have come to learn there is no peace while others suffer. Have you not learned that?I can vanquish her. Defeat her. I am the only one. She told me so herself. Duke Hammond starts to object, but Snow White's eyes and, now her feet, lead her down the stairs to her people. When she reaches the last step - now at their level - she speaks...I have been told that I represent you, that it is my place to inspire you. That is wronct. I am not a Queen, not a leader, not a warrior. Absolute silence in the courtyard as people, lords, knights hang on her every word.You represent me, who I've become - your hopes,: your courage, your will - inspires me.If Ravenna comes for me, I will ride to meet her. And if she doesn't, I will ride to meet her. Alone if I must. But if you would join me, I will gladly give my life for you. For this land and its people have lost too much. Eric and the dwarves couldn't look prouder. Duke Hammond stares at her for a moment, then BOWS. A beat, then William follows, then all the Lords and Knights. His eyes fixed on Snow White, Eric bows too. Then Beith. Then Muir and his son, Quert. Then Coll and Duir. And finally even Gort and Nion. Snow White stands alone, overwhelmed by the faith of the kneeling warriors, and the responsibility on her shoulders. 171b INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - ROYAL PALACE - NIGHT. 171b Ravenna raises her head to look into the mirror.So the Huntsman fights for something other than himself.If we are at the portcullis when the sun clears the horizon it will be open. They all look at her.Then we should ride now. They'll have the portcullis up by the time we arrive. Duke Hammond considers, then raises his sword. Snow white glances at the huntsman. He breaks rank and rides closer to her. There's a tense silence, then the Duke BRINGS DOWN HIS SWORD and his riders charge down the dunes.I gave my word I would stand with them!It ends today... I have come for YOU!Ten years you locked me away! Ravenna seems to relish this.By fairest blood... it is undone! Ravenna looks down. Three drops of blood fall onto Snow White's armor.Why this? Why all of this?It will be all right... Ravenna whispers incomprehensible words with a peaceful smile on her face. The clouds move in the disc of light above Snow White. The light falls over Ravenna's face. The light fades out of her eyes and she dies.Backlit in a golden hue. A crown is placed on her head. We're in... Packed for the coronation. Duke Hammond and Bishops surround her. Snow White smiles and looks out at all assembled - her subjects, her friends, the people she's come to know and love - meeting the eyes of Rose, looking young and beautiful again -- Anna and Lily -- the seven dwarves, who all wipe away tears. She sees William off to the side, smiling, looking on adoringly.

The King is speechless now, gazing upon the face of an angel.That is kind, child. Especially when it is said that yours is the face of true beauty in this kingdom. Snow White doesn't quite know how to answer this.Would you like to be dressed up like this and married one day? Snow White nods.I hope you'll invite me?I know it is difficult, child. When I was your age I, too, lost my mother.Yes. A King tore me from her arms, dressed me in lace and stole my innocence. Snow White's smile dies a bit; confused.I can never take your mother's place, but I feel that you and I are bound. I feel it here. Snow White mimics, touching her own heart, and smiles at Ravenna. It should be a touching moment but something in Snow White's face - the way her smile lights up the room - gives Ravenna pause.The bane of Kings. When she does arrive she slowly crawls onto the bed, rolls him on his back, straddles him and offers the goblet.Sup, my lord. King Magnus drains the goblet, tosses it and gropes her body.Now you are mine. Her eyes gleam in the firelight. Magnus tries to playfully wrestle her off, but she grabs his hands and holds him down firmly.I will destroy you.As my people were destroyed. As my family was destroyed. As I would have been destroyed. He is slightly confused by this and his face begins to show discomfort.But when a woman stays young forever - no man can resist her - and the world is hers. He suddenly STARTS TO CHOKE, his eyes widening in surprise. As he struggles for breath...First I will take your life, my lord. Then I will take your throne. She reaches beneath the sheets, pulls out an ORNATE DAGGER and BRINGS IT DOWN THROUGH HIM -- 13a EXT. OUTSIDE ROYAL BEDROOM 13a Several Guards line the hallway. The door opens and Ravenna emerges. As she moves past them...The King has laid down his sword for the night. Their eyes take her, lustfully, in as she strides away and disappears around a corner.Drink! Ravenna chokes it down.Welcome, brother.Mirror, mirror, on the wall Who is the fairest of them all? There'.s a brief silence, then the surface of the mirror ripples. LIQUID-spills onto the floor where it reforms into the shape of THE MIRROR MAN. His body is a veil of reflective bronze but his face-is a distorted version of Ravenna's own.So kind of you all to stay over.To the sword.Finn! Finn stops his exit with Snow White, and turns. Ravenna stares at the little girl, not sure where she stands with this one. And then,...Lock her away. One never knows when royal blood may be of value.And what of the Duke?Lay siege to it.Then lure him out! Burn every village that supports him. Poison their wells. If they still resist put their heads on pikes to decorate the roads!I wish to interrogate them myself. She drops her robe and walks up the steps to her bath. She lowers herself into the white liquid. Her face disappears beneath the viscous liquid, then she rises, like a porcelain statue.Finn, do you remember when we were children, begging for scraps like those wretches?Am I not kinder?You left your home, your family, the bosom of my protection, to aid my enemies? Why?Lost everything?Very handsome.There was a time I would have lost my heart to a face like yours -- and you would have no doubt broken mine. In a flash Iain grabs a Guard's dagger and rams it into Ravenna's chest. She makes a pained face, looks down at the dagger, then up to Iain.You would kill your Queen? She pulls the dagger out - there is no\"wound, no blood - and drops it on the ground. Iain and Thomas are shocked.You have beauty. And courage. But how strong is your heart? She smiles, almost regrettably, then places her hand on his chest. We hear HIS HEART START TO HAMMER -- LOUDER AND LOUDER. He grimaces in pain as she SQUEEZES -- the hammering filling his ears -- until his heart finally bursts and he drops dead. Thomas falls to his knees in horror, trying to revive his son. Finn draws his sword to behead him when Ravenna raises her hand.No. Let him return to the Duke and speak of the generosity of his Queen. With that she sweeps out, followed by Finn. It's only now that we see the lines on her face. Finn takes her by the arm as she falters.And the expense grows.old?...My powers... fade. This is about as much as Ravenna can confess. Finn watches as she walks up the stairs to the mirror chamber. Then he turns and CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE. A GUARD appears and Finn nods.Mirror, mirror, on the wall, Who is the fairest of them all? The bronze ripples. The Mirror Man pours out and reforms.More beautiful, but --She won't live to see tomorrow. Who is it?! Give me her name?!Snow White?How is it an innocent young girl makes a fool of my brother?! Armed only with a nail?! If she'd had a sword she'd have taken the whole castle! We're in front of her, behind her, on her face, on her feet -- She picks up the pace as well as the volume --You swore to protect me! Do you not understand what, the girl means to us?! This is my future! This is everything. Everything!There is no one I can trust in this place!! There is no loyalty! None!!!!She's no good to me there, lost. I must have her heart! You have failed me! Finn's had enough, he erupts at her --Have I not given you all? All. She raises her finger and touches his face. His wound heals instantly and his face grows calm. He nods.Don't fail me again, Finn.My brother tells me you are a widower, a drunkard and one of few who has ventured into the dark forest. Finn looks on, standing nearby.One of my prisoners has escaped there.She. She shoots Finn a pointed look then looks back at Eric.Find her. Bring her to me. Eric holds her gaze, uneasy at the request.You will be rewarded handsomely.There may be more than gold in the offing.That is none of your concern.You will do this for me, Huntsman.So you wish to be reunited with your beloved? Eric reacts instinctively, grabbing her by the throat. The courtiers rise to their feet and the guards draw their swords, but Ravenna holds up her hand.My condolences. Ravenna holds his gaze.You miss her? His eyes say, yes, he misses her horribly.What would you give to bring her back? Eric stares at her curiously.You know of my powers. Bring me the girl and I will bring back your wife.I can. Believe me, huntsman. Eric's eyes say he wants to believe. Needs to believe.A life for a life.Find her.What did you say? Then she's right in her face --Finn ...no! She falls to the floor - writhing. She fights hard at first - but then begins to weaken - her power fades as she ages. Then she stops.Forgive me, brother.You will pay. You will pay!!!You see, child, love always betrays us. A sigh escapes Snow White's lips, condensing into steam.By fairest blood it was done and only by fairest blood can it be undone. You- were the only one who could break the-spell and end my life, and the only one pure enough to save me. She draws away, unwrapping her sacramental dagger.You don't realize how lucky you are, never to know what it is to grow old.What must I do?! Where is she?! Where have they taken her?! Answer me! The mirror just REFLECTS RAVENNA'S weary and aging face.help me...I don't need a map to see you've failed me, fool, your face is map enough!Where are they now?Deserters?Let them come. Let them break their hearts and skulls on these castle walls and bring my prize to me. You must not harm her. I need her heart -- still warm with blood. As she strides away. To soldiers --Victory comes! 178a EXT. PLAINS - WIDE - DAWN. 178a Hammond's army thunders toward the castle. And then they arrive at --Come to me.Let her come to me...ALIVE! Ravenna's soldiers are merely there to hold Snow White's army back. She has planned the whole thing, calculated every move.I'll show you thorns! In a terrifying tremor, the black ceiling of the throne room starts to shatter into millions of shards. Snow White turns back to see William, Eric and Hammond's men - the shards fall down like razor blades. The men try to protect themselves. Some are caught out and skewered to the stone floor. Ravenna looks down at them in complete satisfaction.Come! ... Avenge your father, who was too weak to raise his sword. The millions of shards assemble themselves into three seven foot tall, razor sharp creatures. The DARK FAERIES: Ravenna's ultimate soldiers. Snow White looks at Eric and William - unable to help her.And every day, every hour led you to this ,moment. It burned inside you. It drove you forward, and here you are.. Listening only to her heart, Snow White lunges towards Ravenna and tries - strikes at her with her sword. Ravenna steps aside and with very little effort - throws her to the other side of the room.That's it. Fight. Fight for your land... for your loss and for Hope!Watch them die. You gave them hope and they believed you. You have lead them to their deaths. How foolish your followers.You were never ready for this princess! Snow White struggles to get out of her lock. Ravenna is too strong. Snow White's wrist is twisted. She holds her sword tight but can't use it. Ravenna forces the twist. Her fragile bones crack. Snow White screams in pain. The sword drops on the ground.Oh... please! Ravenna back hands Snow White, sending her crashing to the wall. SLAM! Cuts on her face. Ravenna looms closer, through the fire in the middle of the room. She stands IN the fire, unaffected. For Snow White it is a vision of pure hell. So much power, so much hate.I have lived many lives. Ravaged entire kingdoms, I have been given powers you can't fathom. You cannot defeat ME? .you are but a child!But you are right... it is over. Ravenna's laughter pierces Snow White like a dagger. She feels powerless and lost, spitting blood and exhausted. What else can she do? Snow White stands up, stumbles, her right arm limp, blood dripping down her face. She stares at Ravenna, she won't back down... she will never back down.I will never stop... I will give this wretched world the Queen it deserves... Ravenna slams Snow White down onto the stone floor next to the mirror altar. Snow White stretches for her sword as Ravenna approaches. Ravenna un-sheaths her dagger.By fairest blood it is done! Ravenna strikes... in the blink of an eye Snow White blocks her strike, reaches for her dagger and plunges it into Ravenna's chest, just as the huntsman taught her. Ravenna gasps, locks eyes with Snow White.See child,... we are bound.", "clean_line": "ravenna sire king speechless gazing face angel kind child especially said face true beauty kingdom snow white

The King's men!I will protect my sister! Ravenna's mother reaches out and touches her son's forehead, closes her eyes, an incantation of sorts...So it shall be, Finn.Yes, my Queen.Are you alright? Ravenna pulls her arm away furiously. The General and the others stare, alarmed.Magic comes at a lofty price.You look...Tired.I have something for what ails you. She turns to see -- Finn, with Rose. Ravenna almost smiles. Rose holds her gaze defiantly. Ravenna walks over, admires her face, smiles, then takes her by the throat and -- LIFTS HER OFF HER FEET. Rose opens her mouth to scream but instead of sound, ENERGY pours out. Ravenna opens her mouth, DEVOURING GRETA'S YOUTH AND BEAUTY. Like a flower blooming, her lines vanish. Like a flower wilting, Rose AGES until she's as old as the scullery maids.Yes, Queen?...Did I wake you? Snow White shakes her head gently.Are you always awake when I watch you?My Queen won't allow it. She wants you all to herself.Not of me.It's alright, princess. You will never again be locked in a cell.Your beating heart. Snow White grips the roofing nail even tighter as she looks at him. As he leans closer, she notices his off hand - the dagger and -- She SLASHES him across the face with the nail. Blood flies. Finn reacts, grabs his face in pain, yells and Snow White kicks him and runs for the door, locking it behind --She was chased into the dark forest. She's likely already dead. She SCREAMS and slaps him viciously.Have I not given all to you?! She takes this, softens, unexpectedly, and almost smiles.Indeed, my Queen.The Queen demands the services of someone to navigate the Dark Forest. The villagers stay mum, shaking their heads.You will be compensated. Still no takers. An OLD-TIMER stares right at FINN, steps forwards.Where might I find him.The Queen demands your presence.You fought in the west? Against the armies of the five kings? Eric nods without looking at him, gazing at the forest.You must have seen a great deal of death?Come now, you're being modest. There is a difference between gutting a deer and gutting a man. How many did you kill?Nor I. But I recall every face. There is no greater delight than battle. Eric finds this unseemly, but prefers not to engage.Come now, huntsman, what do you feel when you watch a man die? Delight? Invincibility?And what of them? At the tip of your sword. What do they feel? I'd enjoy knowing. Eric looks at him, realizing from Finn's face that it is an honest question. -The.only difference between you and I is I'-never found a wife to save my soul.Quick work! Eric looks up to see Finn and his men approaching. Snow White gasps at the sight of Finn.Well done, huntsman. Hand her over.Why do you care? Finn nods and the Guards approach. Eric grips her tighter.Come now huntsman, you did your job well. Keep your word and hand her over.You are a drunk and a fool. My Queen has many powers; she can take life or sustain it. But she can't bring your wife back from the dead.Butcher him! Find her! The Guards, also trying to cover their noses, move forward. Eric has a decision to make. Bad odds. And he's injured. Eric decides in an instant, grabs his knife out of the dead Guard, as well as his hatchet from the tree and runs after Snow White --This is not finished! The words echo through the dark forest. 67b EXT. DARK FOREST - ERIC AND SNOW WHITE - SAME 67b Eric removes his hand from Snow White's mouth. At once she PUNCHES HIM WITH ALL SHE'S GOT. He steps back, licks his bloody lip. She takes another swing. This one he manages to grab.Which of you knows the dark forest? A powerfully built Yakut tracker, ALDAN, and BROCH both nod.You. You. You. You. He's selected Aldan, Broch and points to others. As we move down the line we see -- William, hat low, trying to look tough. Finn selects a few more.Load and prepare. You ride for bounty. Into the dark forest. The rest of you. Away ! As they disperse.. William sets his jaw, and heads off..I have a bowman. Away. WILLIAM stands unblinking.I said away, damn you! WILLIAM doesn't move. Finn turns to the bowman.Kill him.Wait! Finn sizes up William.You're quick with a bow.Why?Have you traversed the Dark Forest?Then what use are you?Replace him. William looks at Finn gratefully. Finn studies him with a curious smile then rides on.Run, rats, run. Find her! William looks around the burning village in panic.Have you seen her?I captured many girls, but your wife was special.She fought and then she begged. For her life. Please?!!! You should know she called for you. Your Sara.She told me. Just before I slit her throat.Now you can look for her in the other world and beg for her forgiveness.Sister -- heal me!! --Sister...
