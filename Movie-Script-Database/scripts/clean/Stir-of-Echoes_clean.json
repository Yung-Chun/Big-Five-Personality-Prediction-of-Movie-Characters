{"Stir-of-Echoes": {"MAGGIE": {"raw_line": "Who you talkin' to, Jake? He turns to her and whispers.Is he asleep? My brother's here.Should we tell him?I'm pregnant.He saved my life.I'm serious. The summer I was nineteen, I was at Jones Beach, I swam out too far and got a cramp in my leg. There was no way I was gonna make it back. I was goin' down, I was swallowing water and everything. Tom was a lifeguard. I don't know what he was doing out that far, he said he just had a feeling.Had to. He said I'm his slave until I saved him back.I saw his arm the next day. It left a mark.Yeah, right.Hey Frank, you're the one who's so curious, why don't you-Ah, that's different. Whaddya got to hide?Philip, have you ever done this before?Have you ever done it before?Try not to screw him up permanently.Are you okay?You said it didn't hurt at all. And he kept it moving.Tom, you didn't do anything embarrassing or anything.I hope it's a girl, I can't help it. Six brothers, I mean, give me a break. I'm sick of all these balls around the house. He doesn't laugh. She rolls over, strokes his chest with one hand. MAGGIE What's the matter?\"Please, baby, please baby, just this one time, I can't feel anything with one of those on.\"You don't have to. We'll get by, we always do. Tom stares at a dark brown water stain on the ceiling.Relax. Her hand is moving. He twists.It's a good job. You know how many guys would kill for your job?Relax. She's making it hard for him to concentrate.Let me help.What do you mean, like... You mean like a hallucination?Did you, uh, get her name?You sure you weren't dreami.g?What should we do? You want to call Philip?How about my cousin Elizabeth?Well, if anything like this happens again, we should go talk to Elizabeth.Promise me.-- you'd consider dumping whatever bimbo you're going out with Friday night and baby-sitting for us instead?I'd call mom, but it's a long drive for her and she's not feeling very well again, so... call me as soon as you can, and no, I'm not kidding.Well, that'll happen in about a million years.Good idea. She picks up the phone and dials a number. Jake just keeps eating. Behind him: MAGGIE Hi, Vanessa, it's Maggie. What's your baby-sitter's name again, Dorothy? Are you gonna use her Friday night? Really? Would you mind if I asked her to sit for us, just this once? Oh, great, thank you so much, you saved my life. What's her number? Uh huh, uh huh. Great, thanks again. Okay. She hangs up and finishes her make-up in her reflection in the toaster. MAGGIE When did you ever meet Dorothy, Jake?Oh, I bet you saw her when you were over playing with Jessica the other day, right? She was there then? Jake turns to the empty chair on his left. He looks at it for a moment, then turns back to Maggie.Hi, Dorothy, thanks for coming, remem ber me? I'm Maggie, we met over at Vanessa's once or twice. Okay, Jake's asleep already and he hardly ever wakes up, a band could play in his room and he wouldn 't hear it, soGreat! Let me just grab my coat we' re out of here. andVanessa recommended her. She's used her before, she said she's real reliable. Tom nods. Are you... She's looking at the Advil. He smiles, faking it.Are you okay? He forces a smile. They head into a crowded tunnel that leads into the stadium.Tom, wait!What the hell is the-What?!Oh, my God! She bounds up the steps, calling out for Jake.What the hell is the matter with you?! Dorothy jumps to her feet and races through the door that leads to the back, where the buses leave from.Samantha?Where have I heard that name before?But she could still be around! Hiding or something. I mean, she could have actually been here when you saw her!Where was she? When you saw her, where was she exactly?What was it like? At the game, I mean, how did you know about Jake? Did you see anything?Like when I was drowning?Does it hurt when it happens?God, Tommy, what's the matter with you?If your brain is tearing in half?I like it better in.You'll go insane. Kill yourself. Kill me and Jake first.I want you to go see my cousin Elizabeth. Make sure there's nothing wrong. Just tell her about the headaches, that's all she needs to know, you don't have to bring up the other stuff. Suddenly, he smiles.Yeah, right here. She hands him a cassette. Elizabeth puts it into a tape deck and pushes \"play.\"What abnormality?How uncommon?There's really nothing wrong with him? Nothing at all?Jake, do you remember the other day when we were talking in the kitchen? Jake doesn't look up, just keeps playing and HUMMING. MAGGIE I was loo3.ing for a baby-sitter, remember? And you said \"Samantha\" told you about Dorothy. Do you remember that? He keeps playing, HUMMING.Is Samantha someone who talks to you sometimes, Jake? No answer. She tries a different route. MAGGIE Can you remember any of the things that Saman- Jake looks up sharply.Tom? He can't answer. He's panicked, but unable to move. With every twitch of his chest clouds of steam burst from his mouth, all the air going out, none coming in. From the top of the stairs, Maggie can see him, standing there, hand outstretched into the darkness, touching nothing. But from Tom's point of view, he's touching fingertips with Samantha. He's frozen, breathless, and now his cheeks start to turn pale, unnaturally white. Another few seconds of this and he'll pass out. MAGGIE Tom!? She races down the stairs. MAGGIESheila, if you're so miserable, why don't you leave? Adam's almost out of school, he can handle it.How long have you guys been there?So... you know most of the people around here pretty well, right?is questioning Sheila.Did you ever hear of a girl named Samantha Muller?I think so.I'm sure they're very nice people, but in case they aren't -- She hands a thin black cannister to him. MAGGIE Mace the shit out of `em. He smiles and shoves it in his pocket. She kisses him.Hey! You're home early! She struggles to take the keys out of the door while still holding the groceries. MAGGIE Can you pick up Jake? I'm exhausted! She comes in and kicks the door shut behind her. Tom's nowhere to be seen. From somewhere in back, there is a faint CRUNCHING sound. MAGGIE Hello? No answer. She heads into the kitchen with the groceries.Hey, look what I'm not cleaning up. She sets the groceries down on the counter and pulls out a gallon of milk. She opens the refrigerator. She does a double take. The entire top shelf is jammed with cardboard cartons of orange juice. From outside, the CRUNCHING sound comes again. She follows the muddy footprints out the kitchen door.Tom? Tom raises the pick high and brings it down hard. CRUNCH. The hole he's in at the moment isn't more than two or three feet deep. But, hey, it's early. Maggie draws closer. In between swings -- MAGGIE Tom. Tom whirls, the pick raised to defend himself. His shirt's off, his chest and face are streaked with mud and sweat. Maggie jumps back.S scared you? Swing. CRUNCH. MAGGIE Tom. Swing. CRUNCH. MAGGIE What are you doing?What do you mean? Zom shrugs. Swings the pick.Who says? He just looks at her from under his sweaty brows. You know who. MAGGIE Oh. Tom manages to break apart the rock he was working on with the pick. He tosses the axe, which bounces crazily across the grass at Maggie's feet. She jumps out of the way. He hoists himself out of the hole and picks up the garden hose. He sprays water into the hole. MAGGIE Why are you doing this?No, I mean... Could you stop for a minute? Would you please stop for a minute?What are you searching for?I think we should call the police.Why don't you come in the house with me? Take a break. I want to talk to you, you're not yourself right now.My brother Steve. My mother's going back in the hospital again.What? He shakes his head. MAGGIE What?What is it? Tom can't look at her. The phone RINGS again. Tom gets up, opens the door that leads to the back yard, and goes outside.Sunday. We should leave as soon as we can.Do I WANT you to come with me:! To my MOTHER'S FUNERAL?! Of COURSE L want you to come, why the hell WOULLV'T you come?! But he's looking past her, at the holes in the yard.It's me. TOM Oh, hi. How ya doin'?I'm okay. TOM How's your family?You know. Drunk. Fighting with each other. TOM Listen, Maggie, I'm sorry. I was an asshole. I should be there with you right now.Yeah, well, what can I say? You are kind of an asshole. How do you feel? TOM Fine. A lot better. Much, much better. Everything's fine here. Real good.Have you had any- TOM Nope. Not even one.No, uh... no more digging?Look, I'm sorry too. I' wish I hadn't just stormed out of there, I shouldn't have left you alone. TOM I deserved it.Are you okay? You sound funny. What are you doing? TOM Just... moving a chair. There.Why don't you come up here with us? This time of night you could make it in an hour. TOM Well, I can't, really.Why not? TOM I'm, uh, not supposed to use the truck for personal trips.Alright. I'll come down there and get you. I'll leave right now. Behind her, the bedroom door swings open. Jake stands there. He looks terrible. She doesn't hear him come in. TOM No, no, no, no, no, what do you want to do that for? Don't come down here.Oh, my God, I gotta go. I'll be there in an hour. TOM Maggie, wait, no, Mag- She hangs up the phone and races over to her son.Honey, what happened? Why didn't you tell me you had to go to the potty? Jake turns and looks at her.Jake, come on, we have to go.What?Why not?What does that mean, Jake? He shrugs. Philip, Maggie's brother, stands in the doorway to the other room.Be good. She opens the door and heads out. As it's swinging shut:Mace... shit. She starts up the stairs. She reaches the top. The last light that was on inside clicks off. Now the house is totally black inside. Remembering something, she pulls her purse around and feels inside it. She finds the butterfly knife, the one she found in Tom's pants. She holds it in her left hand, keys in her right. She goes to the door. She unlocks the deadbolt. Inside, she hears a SCURRYING sound. She unlocks the knob. She puts the keys back in her purse.Tom? No answer. She steps inside and fumbles for a light switch. She flicks it. Nothing happens. MAGGIE Are you here? She crosses the room to another light and CLICKS its switch. As the light floods the room: Harry, who was hiding behind the front door, BANGS it shut. Kurt Damon is still kneeling on Tom's back, holding one hand roughly over his mouth, trying to keep him quiet. MAGGIEHi, baby, did you sleep well? I sure didn't. The baby sees Maggie's face, blurry, but friendly. Tom leans in.If you're very, very careful.

it, Daddy. The hell does that mean? But before Tom can respond, Jake turns, climbs back in bed, rolls over to face the wall, and goes back to sleep.I told him. MAGGIE Oh. Yeah, I understand. No, no, no, don't worry about it. Okay. Bye. Shit. Shoot. Shoot, I mean. She picks up the phone and dials again. With all she's doing, she doesn't notice that Jake is having a conversation with the empty chair. MAGGIE Philip, hi, it's me, call me when you wake up, is there any way --Yes.Who?Okay.Call Vanessa and ask her about Dorothy. i'aggie stops, looking at him. Jake is calmly eating his c\u00e2\u0080\u00a2.real. She looks at her watch.Samantha told me.Yes. That's when I met her. He goes back to eating his cereal. A DOORBELL rings.Oh, hi, Mommy. She's relieved, but livid.Daddy, look!Bye, Neil! The Cop looks back over his shoulder and smiles. Tom looks at his son as if he's never seen him before.Don't ask the boy any more questions. They freeze, staring at him. His tone was odd. And did he just refer to himself in the third person? JAKE Talk to me. He goes back to playing, and to that little tune. It's becoming rather haunting. Maggie and Tom look at each other. Good God.Feathers everywhere. Maggie turns back to Jake -- and GASPS. He's peeing his pants, the urine drizzling down over his shoes.Help Daddy.I'm staying here.I want to stay at Uncle Steve's, I don't want to go home.Because I'm not safe there. Because of the feathers.Don't stop for the train, Mommy.Let me see, let me see! Maggie turns the baby so she's facing Jake. The infant looks at her older brother. At first, his face is as blurry as everybody else's. But slowly, Jake's face becomes crystal clear, even though everything around him stays out of focus. JAKE Can I hold her?Don't be afraid of s t.

For I have never been afraid of anything. Not very. I was deep within the woods when, suddenly, I spied them. I saw a pair of pale green pants with nobody inside them! I wasn't scared. But, yet, I stopped. What could those pants be there for? What could a pair of pants at night be standing in the air for? Maggie leans in the doorway and whispers.`Bout a million to one.Depends. How big you like `em? The hot engine of a Yellow Trans-Am fires up in the driveway of the house across the street. It backs into the street, its passenger door hanging open. The DRIVER honks the horn and a SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD KID runs out of another house and jumps into the moving vehicle. They take off. The Homeless Guy berates them, shaking his fist. They reach the steps of the house next door. PARTY NOISE comes from within, shadows move in the windows. Tom swings Maggie around, puts her on the step, wraps his arms around her, and kisses her. Great kiss. It goes on.Sure.I don't know, I just found out about this.Seven years, and I've still never been to a party where you weren't the one I wanted to hang with. She smiles, melted, and they part. Tom joins the men. BOBBY, Vanessa's husband, an athletic-looking guy holding a sleeping three-year-old on his shoulder, talks with FRANK McCARTHY, fortyish, big Irish drinker, and HARRY DAMON, who is also older than the rest.Alive on the planet. Harry.Actually, I'm drillin' holes in all the floors, Harry.Well, I grew up about a mile from here, it ain't like a foreign country.What the hell? I'll try anything once.Damn fine lookin' finger. Laughter.Can you clean out the nail, it's kinda makin' me sick here. Philip raises two fingers and jabs Tom in the eyes. TOM Hey, what the fuck?Asshole.Poke me again you son of a batch and I'll clock you, I swear to Go'..Yeah.I want to be fuckin' hypnotized, already.Didn't work, huh? All six faces burst out laughing, a great nervous tension released. Somebody turns the lights back on, somebody else hits the music. TOM What? More laughter. Philip seems very pleased with himself. Maggie comes and sits on the arm of the chair next to Tom, puts her hand on his face.Did somethin' happen? People start talking, all at once.What are you talking about?How am I supposed to feel?What'd you do to me?That happened?Hey, thanks a lot, it was very nice of you not to burn my flesh.Who?What?Not time for what?Aright, somebody else go. Come on, let's go, somebody else, right now.Nobody? Well, then I guess the party's over, ain't it? Let's go. Come on, let's go home.You know, I don't think so, because I'll tell you something, it's a very nasty feeling to know somebody's been fuckin' around in your head for everybody else's amusement, you know? I mean, Joey Ariola, Christ, I haven't thought about him in maybe ten years, and -- come on, man, somebody else has gotta go. Don't make me be the only-I... have no idea. Even more laughter, now everybody's slapping him on the back. Tom nods, \"yeah, yeah, laugh it up.\"Any other surprises you left in my head, you fuckin' dead man, you?Two kids. I'm only twenty-six. How did this happen? She slides one hand down, under the covers.No, I now how it happened, I'm just sayin'... You're gonna have to stop work, at least for a while. I'll be workin' Saturdays for at least another year, maybe two.How many times I gotta ask Harry to fix that? He said he fixed this place up, so how come the roof leaks every time it rains?Maggie, you don't think, I mean, ten, twelve years from now... I don't want you to think I'm gonna be a line man forever, you know, like Frank or somethin'.I'm smarter than that, I know I am.I'm smarter than Philip, Christ, six years in college, he's still got his head up his ass. I just want you to know, this ain't where I plan to stop. She licks his ear. He closes his eyes. TOM All my life, I feel like there's something better inside me, it's trying like hell to get out and it's like x won't let it. She rolls on top of him and whispers..the fuck, man? He puts his hands to the side of his head. It hurts. A lot. Maggie stirs, but doesn't wake up. Tom gets up and walks out. As he passes Jake's room, he does a double take.What?! She repeats, but he can only see her lips moving, the words are lost under the static. Realizing, Tom turns hurriedly toward the TV and hits the mute switch. When he turns back -- -- the woman is gone. He stands in the middle of the room, looking all around him. But he's alone.Maybe. I was awake, I know that. She nods, thinking, no idea how to deal with this.You know, she didn't menti. -in it.Positive. I had this headache like you wouldn't believe, and I was thirsty as hell.Yeah, I'll call him. But I don't think he's got a fuckin' clue in life. From the living room, Jake laughs uproariously at something on the TV.I don't need brain surgery, I just had a weird thing happen, that's all. Like a hypnosis hangover. One-time deal, don't worry about it.Maggie...I promise.Jesus, you guys scared the shit out of me! The kid with Adam doesn't seem embarrassed, he just reaches for the football. Tom beats him to it. TOM You gotta play right here in the middle of the street? Frank is out of his house now, approaching the truck. He wears the same uniform shirt as Tom, carries a tool belt over his shoulder.Aw man, it's dented. This ain't even my truck. They're gonna dock me for this.Hell of an arm ya got there. Kurt smiles and shrugs. Tom tosses the ball back to him. Kurt turns and catches it behind his back as he walks away.Bound to happen some time.Yeah, I'm comin', I'm comin' HARRY Hey, Tom! Tom turns. Harry Damon, the guy from across the street, is headed toward him. But Tom notices something behind Harry. A police car has turned onto the block and is rolling to a stop.It's still two days yet, isn't it? Tom looks more closely at the Cop. He realizes the Cop isn't looking at him, he's looking past him, toward Tom's house.Phil, it's Tom. Is there anything else important you said to me last night, while I was under?Other than the shoe thing, what else did you say to me?Phil, I gotta get back to work, was there anything else you told me to do after I came out of it?Post-hypnotic suggestion, I know what it's called, Phil. Did you leave any others behind when you were kickin' your big, clumsy-ass feet around inside my brain?Tell me the truth, Phil!What thing?What thing?In general, what was it?Yeah, I'd say that about describes it.Never mind, it's gone now. I gotta go.'Whir don't you, uh... why don't you mak%- yourself comfortable. Take off your coat. Without looking at him, Dorothy obediently unzips her jacket and takes it off. Her b reasts are fuller than one would expect at her age. She l ooks up at Tom, and now there's defiance in her eyes. Wh at are you lookin' at? TOM Excuse me. He goes upstairs.Where did you find Dorothy?Too much caffeine, that's all. He pops them in his mouth and swallows them dry. TOM Let's qo,Yeah, `bout that. They round a corner. Just ahead, a high school football field is surrounded by bright lights, mobbed with STUDENTS and PARENTS. A BAND plays on the field, it's just about time for kickoff.Sf\"S TAXING BIM AWWAY!Oh, no. He bounds up the steps and tries the door. It's locked. He fumbles in his pockets for the keys.Jake?! No answer. He races up the stairs.She took him.She can't be that far! He runs to the corner, desperate, and looks up and down the street in both directions. There are a lot of people out, she could be anywhere.Wait right here, keep your eyes open! He opens the door and goes inside.Give him to me. She shakes her head no. Outside, a SIREN WHINES and a police car flashes past the window, its red lights spinning. They both hear it and glance over, then look back at each other. Tom raises an eyebrow. She knows what he means. TOM Give him to me, Dorothy. Trembling, Dorothy reaches out, Jake in her arms. Tom gently takes the boy from her and holds him tight. The front door flies open and Maggie races inside. Tom gives Jake over to her.Take him home! I'll be there as soon as I can! He runs after Dorothy.Sit up. Sit up, I want to talk to you. She manages to drag herself into a sitting position. She shoves back, against the wheel of a bus. Beyond them, the bus that nearly hit her stops on the far side of the lot. Dorothy is quivering, still crying. Tom squats in front of her, a few feet away. TOM Why were you taking my son?Do you want me to call the police? Then tell me why you took him.Why do you say that?Jake said that? What else did he say?Where were you taking him?You too? Why aren't you safe here? She doesn't answer. The Driver is coming over to them, stillWho is he?! She just looks at him, frightened. He shakes her, violently. TOMAre you Duane?She's a little girl, you son of a bitch! She' s fifteen years old, and you fucked her!? What the hell is the matter with you?! YOU DON'T DO SHITYou got ten minutes. Pack your shit. You don't leave a note, you don't try to call, and if you ever, ever come back here again, I'll know, I'll find you, and I'll stick this so far into you they'll never get it out. You got it? Duane nods, terrified.I'll stay until he's gone. Upstairs, dresser drawers SLAM, Duane CURSES. He's packing. TOM Shouldn't be long.Tell your mother I'll pay for this.Who is this woman?Did she have a black dress, kind of a diamond pattern on it?She wore a lot of bracelets, those thick ones, different colors, all up and down her arms?Where is she?Can I talk to her?Why not?Where did she go?What's your sister's name, Dorothy?That's what she said.Dorothy said she ran away about six months ago.If she was, she's very quick getting in and out of a room.On the cushion right next to you. Maggie looks down at the empty half of the couch, freaked out. She pulls in closer to him.It's hard to explain. I just got this -- feeling.A little bit. But a hundred times stronger.Like you wouldn't believe. Fecls like my brain is tearing in half.Why do you assume it's bad? Maybe this is a good thing.I told you there was somethin' in me. Maybe it's comin' out.Just roll with it. What's the worst that can happen?Well, yeah, that...Hey, know what? It is a girl. She furrows her brow, \"how do you know?\", then follows his gaze down to her belly, where his hand is resting.No.Huh?No.No.No thanks.Only in, like, really small spaces. (she looks at him, straightDo we really gotta do this?How's it work? Elizabeth goes to a computer terminal and types in some commands.Can I have another Valium?That would be bad? She smiles and nods. The other Nurse puts a white cloth over his hair.Kinda hot in the coffin. ELIZABETH'S VOICE comes blaring out of speakers mounted on either side of the tunnel.Yo, hey, hey, woah, I'm right here. Can you turn it down a little bit?Great. There's nothing wrong with me, I gotta get back to work. Thank you for everything, Elizabeth, I owe you a giant one, hey, you think I can get some of that Valium to go? Elizabeth scowls at him. TOM Worth a try. Take care, say hi to Michael. I'll pick up Jake, I told him I'd take him to the Pier tonight. He heads for the door, eager to get the hell out of there. Maggie lingers, looking at Elizabeth, hopeful.Woah, check it out. He stops, helps Jake down off his shoulders. Jake presses right up against the glass, staring at the train as it circles the track. Tom squats, admiring it with him.Hey, look at that one! He carries Jake to the next window over, a different display. The Cop wanders closer. Tom finally turns to him, tense. TOM How ya doin'?Is there a law against lookin' in the window now?That's great. See ya later. He sweeps Jake up onto one hip and starts to walk away.What? The Cop smiles and makes a face -- \"you heard me.\"Jake? Mommy's asking you a question. Nothing.She's downstairs. He sits up. His head is killing him again. There's a glass of water on the night table. le grabs it and drinks greedily. He turns and looks to the open -loorway. He swallows. He stands up. He looks down at Maggie, who's still sound asleep. He walks to the door. Maggie stirs, feeling him gone.Samantha? She speaks, but when her voice comes out it's horrible and distorted -- muffled in a strange way. He takes a few trembling steps down the stairs, closer to her. She walks forward a step or two. She speaks again, louder, but the voice is still unintelligible and bizarre. Tom reaches the bottom of the stairs. She reaches out a hand. He stares, terrified. The hand draws closer. Almost beyond his own control, Tom raises his own hand. She comes closer. Tom is frozen at the bottom of the stairs. Their hands draw closer still. Their fingertips touch.I think we better find out.You know you're under surveillance here. He gestures to Sheila, Frank's wife, who's about ten feet away, keeping an angry eye on him.Sure, great, just don't be surprised if some day Sheila digs out your 38 and buries a slug or two in your ass.Spider doesn't fuck around on her.So you've been in this neighborhood a long time, right?Oh, Dorothy baby-sits for us sometimes and she started talking about her sister, wonderin' how she was doing and stuff. I promised her I'd ask around, see if anybody'd heard anything from her.)id she ever live in that house we're .n? Frank comes up, one arm around his son Adam.Okay.Got it.I give up, Frank.Hey, Adam, way to go, man.Well, if you hear anything about her, lemme know, okay?She was almost your age, Adam. You know anything about her? Adam doesn't answer right away. They all look at him.Oh, man... He sits up, painfully. A beam of sunlight cuts him right across the eyes.Frank? What are you doing here? Frank looks up at him. His face is sad.Why did you say that, Frank?Hi.Sure. Adam pulls his arm around from behind his back. He's holding a 38 with a carved white handle.Oh, don't do that. Adam pulls the trigger. Tom SCREAMS as Adam collapses to the floor, blood pouring from his chest. His body convulses --Oh, man... He sits up, painfully. A beam of sunlight cuts him right across the eyes.Please don't be under there. He bends down, lifts the blanket, and looks under the bed. There's his shoe. TOM Shit. He grabs it.Uh... Frank? But Frank's not on the porch either. Tom steps outside.Oh, God...Oh, God, no! Tom picks up a porch chair and heaves it through the window.Oh, God, no, Jesus, no, please... He grabs a blanket off a chair nearby, presses it to Adam's chest, trying to stop the bleeding. TOM This is really happening.., it's really happening...We need some answers, right? Maybe they're the only ones who have any. She nods. Thinking of something, she picks up her car keys from the table by the door and pulls something off the ring.Thank you. Listen, is, uh -- Vivian gives another plate to a man sitting next to Tom, HERMAN, in his seventies, in a wheelchair, an oxygen tube running into his nostrils. TOM Is there a guy named Neil here? He's a cop?Excuse me? Irritated, Herman gestures for him to lean closer. Tom does.I don't... I'm sorry, I don't under- Herman wraps his bony fingers around Tom's wrist.Does everybody here -- see things, like me?Are we the only ones?What about my son?Wright, if there's all these people who got this power, why doesn't everybody know about it? Why isn't it common knowledge?This all started when I was hypnotized. Is that how it always is?So it does go away.What does what want me to do?Why do you assume she wants something?Why me?What do you mean? She can, it can make me do something I don't want to do?What if I stop me? What if I just don't do it?I want you to hypnotize me again.Do it.Would you just get to it, please?There's someone in here.There's someone else here.hard to breatheCouldn't breathe...Plastic, like sheets of plastic... He shoves Philip out of the way, finds the refrigerator on the other side of the room. He rips it open, searches for something to drink. Philip follows him.She told me what she wants.You scared me. And with that, he turns back to the job. Swing. CRUNCH.I'm supposed to dig.I'm supposed to dig.Water softens up the dirt. He tosses the hose aside and grabs a shovel. He jumps back in the hole and starts to dig.What don' t you get? I'm supposed to dig., I'm searching.The question isn't \"what.\" We both know very well \"what,\" even if we don't want to may it out loud. The question, Maggie, which, as you can plainly see, I am very busy trying to answer -- the question is \"Where?\"And tell them what, exactly? Run it by me once. Practice, see how it sounds. Anything else?This is just fucking typical, isn't it? He climbs out of the hole and walks toward her. TOM What do you want me to do, Maggie, you want me to go inside, sit down in front of the TV, drink eight or nine beers till I fall asleep in the chair? Like that? Maybe repeat the whole thing tomorrow and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after--until I grab my chest-and die?! May )e I was already dead! This is the mos. important thing that's ever happ\u00e2\u0080\u00a2ned to me, the most important thins I've ever done in my life, Maggie, my whole stupid life, and you want me to just STOP?! By the and of his tirade, TWO NEIGHBORS are staring over the back fence. He's only a few feet from Maggie now, the veins in his neck standing out. She holds her ground.InterRUPtions! He picks up his tee shirt, snakes angrily into it, and marches across the yard toward the house. TOM What are YOU lookin' at?You gonna drink that? She doesn't answer. He takes her glass, drinks some. TOM I'm sorry. No answer. TOM Okay, I'm not sorry. She ignores him. He looks at the letter in her hands. TOM Who's that from?Nothing. They stare at each other. Tom's face is pale. Maggie is concerned. The phone RINGS. Maggie stares at Tom. The phone RINGS again. She lowers her voice, pleading.When's the funeral?We? She stiffens. TOM Oh, you, uh... you want me to go with you? She looks at him, deeply hurt. Then enraged. She pushes him away from her, hard. He stumbles back into the yard.I'm just... kind of in the middle of something here. She looks at him, absolutely incredulous -- -- and then storms back into the house, SLAMMING the door so hard two of the glass panes spiderweb.Come on! Tom curses and trudges back toward the house.How's he doin'? Frank shrugs. Can't talk much.Frank, I'm sorry. I'm sorry because... I think I know why Adam shot himself. And I have to call the police about it. But I don't want you to hear it from them, I don't want Sheila to read it in the paper. You have the right to know before anybody else.Come with me. He nods toward his own house. Frank stares at him, frightened, but what could possibly be worse than what's already happened?Does it matter?It was.No, it doesn't. He bends down and lifts Samantha's lifeless hand. He pries open her fingers. She's clutching a tuft of hair. TOM But this probably will. Frank stares for a long moment, struck dumb. Finally, he turns his back. His shoulders heave as he cries, silently.Frank, we have to-Who you planning to shoot with that?I think you haven't decided yet. He's right, and Frank knows it.What are you gonna do, Frank? Frank raises the gun, in a fury.Frank, I won't go until you- Frank aims the gun just to the left of Tom's head and pulls the trigger. The bullet CRACKS off the ladder.You... okay? Maggie nods, shaking. TOM You saved me. Baby, I'm alive be;ause of you... They hold each other.I thought so, Frank. I sure as hell always thought so.So you're the one that's been kicking my wife! The baby sees Tom's blurry face. Jake steps up, onto a step stool, so he can see over the edge of the bed.", "clean_line": "walking night saw scary afraid deep woods suddenly spied saw pair pale green pants inside wasn scared stopped

for me.Get the fuck outta here! He grabs Maggie and hugs her. Tom starts up the steps. PHILIP Look at this, I haven't even had a second date in a year and a half, you guys are on your second kid! Philip catches up to Tom and throws his arms around him. PHILIP You big huggable bear. You're still goin' back to school, though, right? You promised me.I'm telling you, if you never go back to college you'll regret it for the rest of your life. The memories I have of being a freshman -- those were three of the happiest years of my life.Not attracted to... -- SHEILA, a thin, nervous woman around Frank's age -- PHILIP Not drunk enough for... -- and a LOUD WOMAN with enormous hair.

Any distraction can break it up. He raises his index finger and holds it about a foot in front of Tom's face. PHILIP Okay. Look at it.Shall we try this again?Look at me, Tom. You're not afraid of this. You want this to happen. Don't you?Maggie, please, I nearly have a master's degree in cognitive psy-Well, I've seen it done a dozen times.You want to be hypnotized. Say yes.\"I want to be hypnotized.\"Okay. Close your eyes. As Tom does, our eyes close too, big heavy lashes dropping over everything and plunging us into blackness. PHILIP Just listen for a moment.How do you feel?A little.., hot, maybe? EveryboJy laughs again. Tom wipes his forehead. He's covered with sweat. He gets up. He doesn't like this at all, being the only one not in on the joke.Nothing much. Just had you stretched out as stiff as a board between those two chairs -- He points to two dining room chairs that are sitting back to back four or five feet apart. PHILIP -- and ran this back and forth under your legs. Tom feels the backs of his legs. He looks at Maggie.Don't.Tom, look --You're getting a little too worked up about this.Why'd you do that, Tom?I couldn't resist. Tom cranks an arm around Philip's neck and pulls him down, choking him. But it's playful, his sense of humor returning.What time is it?Quarter after eight? Jesus, Tom, this is barbaric.Hang on, lemme, I gotta get my bearings here... Who is this again?If you're asking if I gave you a post-No.No, I swear! I went out of my way not to, I even added a thing at the end to make sure!I, I didn't want you to retain any of the experience, you know, I wanted you to have control back, so I made up this thing.God, I don't remember, I haven't had caffeine in almost eighteen hours, how am I supposed to-Well, it was perfectly harmless, I just said, uh, I said \"When you come out from under, your mind will be completely free. There's nothing binding it. Nothing holding it back. You will be completely open.\" Tom stops, thinking for a long moment.Describes what?Describes what? But Tom has hung up. Philip unplugs the phone and goes back to sleep.What, what, what?Just slow down, you gotta be a little patient with me here, `cause, um... well, Tom, Tom, I've got a confession to make.

What happened?!Are you okay?! Tom wipes his brow, he's covered in sweat.I think you need to sit down, man, something very next level was happening there, you should have seen your face. Only beer in the fridge. Tom CRACKS one open and upends it. PHILIP Uh... want a brew? Tom drinks the entire can. PHILIP Feel better? Tom nods, wiping his chin. PHILIP What happened?

Tom looks at him, stunned.The kid who beat you up all the time when you were twelve. You told us all about him. You were cryin' and everything.Not time yet.Lighten up, Tommy, you sound like your own grandfather .That'll pop right out. Use one of them plunger things. Adam, say you're sorry.There you go, he said he's sorry, whaddya want from a kid. Let's go. Frank gets in the truck. The other football players walk toward Tom, calling for the ball.

Tom looks at him.That Damon kid, he's gonna break your old passing records this Friday.Comin' to the game?Two hundred eleven and two touchdowns. Harry lets out a low whistle. Tom sees what the Cop is looking at so intently -- it's Jake, who's playing on the sidewalk in front of their house while Maggie watches. Tom turns back, but as he does the police car is just pulling away.Don't get me wrong, it's great what the Damon kid is doin' and everything, I mean, I'm sorry your record's gettin' broke, but, what, it held up almost ten years? Tom is terribly distracted, looking back over his shoulder, still plagued with a headache.(raising his voice over theSix eighty-three with three game.- left, he only needs to average, ti.iat, a hundred and five, hundred and six yards a game? He hits a thousand and we're talkin' major scholarships, the kid could write his own ticket. That kinda thing's good for everybody, helps the whole neighborhood. He's goin' a hell of a lot farther than I ever did. Look at the quality of the tail he's already gettin'. He passed me in that department when he was about fourteen. He passes Tom the bottle. This time, he takes a swig.What can I do? Nature commands me to spread my seed. I hear and obey.Please. The woman can't even step on a spider.Who?Yeah, Lenny, they're gonna be terrified of you.Two one one.Two hundred eleven.Two hundred and eleven yards rushing the other night. That makes eight ninety-four with two games to play, kid needs a hundred and six, that's only fifty-three a game. He could walk through the rest of the season and hit a thousand.I embarrass him. Are there worse things that can happen to a human being?Jesus, Lenny, don't use that word.They're going to kill you, Tommy. You and Maggie both.This is a decent neighborhood. On the street, TWO KIDS ride their bikes straight at each other, full tilt, SCREAMING. At the last second, one of the kids swerves, the other taunts him with cries of \"Chicken!\" A bird swoops over Tom's head, too low, and Tom flinches. He walks across the driveway, toward Frank's house. The MAILMAN waves to him, headed down the block. Tom waves back. Tom walks up the steps to Frank's front door and knocks. A VOICE calls from inside. ADAM Come in!He might make it. Might not. Sheila's over there now, I'm headed back.What are you talking about?Hang on a second.What the hell is goin' on around here?

This is just a body, it doesn't prove anything.I mean...I mean, what were we supposed to do? Tom stops.

Frank lets his jacket drop to the floor, revealing his right hand. He's holding the 38 with the carved white handle. He turns and looks at Tom.Who do you think?Get out of here.They were gonna kill you, Tommy. You and Maggie both. Frank turns and walks to the front door. He opens it, walks out onto the porch, and sits down on the top step, facing the street. Tom looks at Maggie. They're both in shock, can hardly speak.Cold-blooded murder.
