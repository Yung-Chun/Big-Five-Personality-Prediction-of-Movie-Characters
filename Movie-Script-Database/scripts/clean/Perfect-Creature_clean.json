{"Perfect-Creature": {"LILLY": {"raw_line": "...but there was also a miracle. One of these plagues helped nature create a new kind of being. At first they were called Nosferatu, or Vampire and were feared. But they were not supernatural monsters, just a better version of ourselves. They were the Brothers, and their religion and science helped sustain us against the plagues and influenzas that have ravaged Europe and the rest of the colonies. For 300 years our two races have lived in harmony. Until now...About time.On three gents. One, two...Don't you dare.Jones!It is my pleasure to inform you that you are under arrest for trafficking influenza vaccine.This is a violation of the 12/10 health act, whereby you have withheld borough sponsored vaccines from your tenants.Anything you say will be held against you as evidence and, by endangering the public good, you are not entitled to a lawyer.There's only one other thing.Smells terrible.I'll get out here.No.Arrest her.Find any witnesses and shut them up.Can I step in?Hello Dominic.Any identification?Tanya Garfield.Alright, we'll close this down gents. None of you are to say a word, not even to your old mother.Jones. Make sure.He saw what happened?What's your name?Stop that.What's your name then?You live around here?I grew up 3 streets from here. Matheson Lane. The Skrummers Workhouse.Or should I say, I crawled out of here.No one else will do anything about this, you know? They just think this is a slum. No one really cares what happens to the people here. Except for you. And me.What did you see?What kind of man?You're sure it was a Brother?Where did he go?Alright, you go with these men, they'll look after you. I promise.Get him to describe it all. And keep him away from everyone.And get him some food.I've quarantined the neighborhood.As far as anyone knows we have a new influenza outbreak.They're cooperating, closing all phone lines in and out except directly to us.It's better than the alternative, sir.That's nice for them.Not particularly.How do you know I don't?Senior Brother Edgar... How long have you known about this?Yes. Withholding evidence. Covering up two murders. And no one's worried. If me or one of the people in Jamestown did that they'd be in the hell house with the key thrown away. It seems the church is able to do whatever it wants.Wouldn't want anyone criticizing the church I suppose.Really.None?Differently.Alright then. So what do you suggest?Ok, ok, quiet down.Gentlemen, there's no other way to put it. We have only 2 days to find the suspect.Quiet!What you are about to hear will not leave this room. Everyone understand? Jones?I would suggest anyone with a weak stomach leave now.This is Brother Silus.Jones, sit down.Quiet!There will be two teams. Frank, I want you and Abernathy up in the buildings around Bridge Square.I'll lead the other team with Dominic, Jones and Queen's Imperial Guard in support. No guns, batons only.You heard me. He's to be taken alive.Anything?It's getting late.Ok. We'll sit tight.Frank?Anything?Check each floor again.Frank.Let's go.Police. Get back inside. Get back.Antibiotics. They say it's like an animal bite.I want to thank you.I don't mean that. The blood, they say it saved my life. Is it true that people who go to church are given your blood?So smooth.Healed already.I don't have one. Not any more.Influenza. My husband was quick. But my daughter, Mary, her little body fought it for a long time. So I just waited. Hoped. But then you realize how cruel hope is. And you just want it to end. Not to stop her suffering, but to stop my own.Do we seem pathetic to you?Yes. We're good at that.Take them away from here.You nearly gave me a heart attack.Quiet.Police. Put your hands where I can see them!Let him go.He's harmless. Let him go.Brother Silus. What's going on?And now he's got Steph. Why does he want her?Steph was staying with me. She was wearing my coat. It was me he was after. Wasn't it?It has to be me. That's what he wants. It's the only chance Steph's got.Jones! And we can't make it too hard. He has to be able to get in. He can't suspect anything.That's the way it will be. I'm the bait.What is it? Jones?Cover me.Get him down.If he escapes then Steph is dead. Just follow me when you can, hurry!Don't move!I said don't move. Where is she, where's the girl?He's nothing like you.No.Why don't you just kill me?Kill me!You're insane.You don't have to do this. You can change things.No.Hello! I'm down here. Silus...Silus...What is it?Is there something wrong?I don't understand.For me, everything has changed now. Because of Silus I see the world through new eyes.Now I see hope, and I see a child, the first female of her kind.Perhaps Edgar got what he wanted after all, because it time this child will truly change our world.", "clean_line": "miracle plagues helped nature create new kind called nosferatu vampire feared supernatural monsters better version brothers religion science helped sustain plagues influenzas ravaged europe rest colonies years races lived harmony time gents dare jones pleasure inform arrest trafficking influenza vaccine violation health act withheld borough sponsored vaccines tenants held evidence endangering public good entitled lawyer thing smells terrible ll arrest witnesses shut step hello dominic identification tanya garfield alright ll close gents word old mother jones sure saw happened stop live grew streets matheson lane skrummers workhouse crawled know think slum cares happens people kind man sure brother alright men ll look promise away food ve quarantined neighborhood far knows new influenza outbreak cooperating closing phone lines directly better alternative sir nice particularly know senior brother edgar long known yes withholding evidence covering murders worried people jamestown hell house key thrown away church able wants wouldn want criticizing church suppose differently alright suggest ok ok quiet gentlemen way days suspect quiet hear leave room understand jones suggest weak stomach leave brother silus jones sit quiet teams frank want abernathy buildings bridge square ll lead team dominic jones queen imperial guard support guns batons heard taken alive getting late ok ll sit tight frank check floor frank let police inside antibiotics like animal bite want thank mean blood saved life true people church given blood smooth healed influenza husband quick daughter mary little body fought long time waited hoped realize cruel hope want end stop suffering stop pathetic yes good away nearly gave heart attack quiet police hands let harmless let brother silus going got steph want steph staying wearing coat wasn wants chance steph got jones hard able suspect way bait jones cover escapes steph dead follow hurry said girl like kill kill insane change things hello silus silus wrong understand changed silus world new eyes hope child female kind edgar got wanted time child truly change world"}, "SILUS": {"raw_line": "Augustus. We failed this girl. We asked her to help us catch him, and then we failed her.Perhaps this is beyond us. Perhaps we should inform the authorities. The human beings.If they find out we are covering up these deaths...Perhaps they have good reason.A matter of weeks.Is there something wrong?You're right to not like it. It is political.We thought we could find Brother Edgar ourselves. We were wrong. But now any debate is pointless.The greatest danger is if this were to become public knowledge.It's more than that Captain. This is about prejudice, or rather the nature of it. As a female surely you would understand.How many other Captains in this borough are female?How are your actions judged, the same or differently from the men.Exactly. If a white man kills, then he is just a killer. If a black man kills, then all black men are suspect. That is the nature of prejudice. Those who are different are grouped together. If only one Brother does a bad thing then all Brothers are suspect, because we are different. And then what would this world be like, if there was no hope?First, there is something you should hear.Thank you Captain. Could we have the plate?Senior Brother Edgar. Until 3 weeks ago, he was a trusted and talented theologian and scientist.He was personally responsible for developing the most recent influenza antivirals. It is because of him that most of you are alive today. His behavior appeared normal. Next.The victims. John Anderson. Julie Danes. Tanya Garfield. All in their early 20's, but beyond that no obvious connection. Next.There is no precedent for Brother Edgar's behavior. No Brother has ever taken a human life, not in the 300 years since we began. Not one. Our role has been to preserve and maintain the human life. Not take it.What I am saying to you is that Brother Edgar's behavior is aberrant. Wedon't understand it. And therefore it's difficult to predict. The only thing we know is where he will strike next.We share the same mother. There is a bond.Yes.No.He will come.Do you want me to save her?She is dying.Lilly. Stop fighting now. Fall back, fall back...Quiet.He's going up.No.We all caught Edgar.Sometimes the rituals call for it. Some say they have visions from it. That it restores their health.In some ways my body is like a human embryo. The cells regenerate quickly. It is why we live so long. Will someone come for you? Your family?I see.I am sorry.No. Fragile. Worn down by nature. But you fight back.I think yours will be a good life to watch, Lilly. Goodbye.How is he?Is the brace necessary?Insane then.With what?Designed?Since when do they sanction such things?The police officer. Lilly. Did he infect her with this?Hello my Brother.You are sick. We will help you if we can.She survived.You won't touch her.I will pray for your cure, Brother.Yes.The church does not deny the potential. Only the motivations of those who want to exploit it. And the fact that we understand so little of its power.Disease is part of nature, it will always be a part of our lives.Let the blood be one and the two races join, as the Perfect Creature.The question becomes what will he do next? He said he would kill us all. But especially the police officer. Lilly.No. You are divine. It is the world that offends me.It is Edgar.She is not what he was after.Yes. He will come for you Lilly.He will know. He will see and hear it.Stay here.It comes from Edgar. He has shared his blood with them.No. He will keep her alive.So that I will come for him. That's what he wants.He is somewhere in the quarantine zone. I will find him.No search?What kind of action?And the innocents there, who are not infected?No!We have done this. Released this thing into the world. We have betrayed their trust in us, more than once. I won't do it again.I want to help you. They know you talked to the press.Why?Do you have a map?The water supply. Where is it?He is there, with Lilly.I will get in. You must go to the press. Tell them about the water. Tell them what the government will do.Watch for me, Officer Jones.We have. To our shame.She must be protected.I would ask for your help Brother. The Church can no longer be trusted...Lilly?In there.No.There is something very precious. You must take it, keep it secret.
