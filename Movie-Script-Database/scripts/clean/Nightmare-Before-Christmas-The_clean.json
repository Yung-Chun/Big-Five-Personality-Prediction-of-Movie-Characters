I want to tell you about Christmastown.There are objects so peculiar They were not to be believed All around, things to tantalize my brain It's a world unlike anything I've ever seen And as hard as I try I can't seem to describe Like a most improbable dream But you must believe when I tell you this It's as real as my skull and it does exist Here, let me show youIf you please Just a box with bright-colored paper And the whole thing's topped with a bowThat's the point of the thing, not to knowListen now, you don't understand That's not the point of Christmas landUm, let me explain There's no foot inside, but there's candy Or sometimes it's filled with small toysEveryone, please now, not so fast There's something here that you don't quite grasp Well, I may as well give them what they want And the best, I must confess, I have saved for the last For the ruler of this Christmas land Is a fearsome king with a deep mighty voice Least that's what I've come to understandThere's got to be a logical way to explain this Xmas thing.Hel-loDr. I need to borrow some equipment.I'm conducting a series of experiments.I know.Zero, I'm home.Interesting reaction....but what does it mean?Christmas time is buzzing in my skull Will it let me be?
