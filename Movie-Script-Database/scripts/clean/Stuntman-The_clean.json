{"Stuntman-The": {"ELI": {"raw_line": "Hey, will you stop wiggling?!Oh yeah, that's your story. What's the bird got to say about it?All the divers found in the car was the goddamn camera.No Burt! All gone...caught in the current probably and...they're diving downstream and searching the riverbanks, but...don't say anything to the crew yet...Yeah, Jesus Christ.I don't know...call my mother and have her tell me it wasn't my fault... ...What the hell could have happened?Nina! You damned near scared me to death!Get her into a tub, then bed...and I want to see her in makeup and costume again before dinner.Wait a second! I want to thank you, too!You and Burt on the bridge...how about telling me what happened?Oh?...Why would he do that?Gooks?...That has a nostalgic ring...You guys really used to call them gooks? I thought that was just Time Magazine.Speaking of jail...would you get upset if I asked how many cops were after you?Your I.D. bracelet...the look on your face...the way you ran from the bridge... I...don't suppose you want to tell me what you did....Could I try categories?Ever done any stunt work?How'd you like to be a stunt man? You look like you're in pretty good shape, fast on your feet. You could do it. Besides, You're not gonna have much choice.Now, don't get hasty. And, remember your ass, it's just like mine... maybe I can save them both.Jake, it's been a rotten morning. You're hot and tired. Let's go in, have us a drink and find out what's eating you.Jake...Why not, Burt?! Because you're a fake?! Because you're just a goddamn daredevil with a head full of marbles?!He grabs the bread, blows the shot, screws you up...screws me up. He's dumb, Jake, but thank God, he ain't dead yet. So do me a favor, put your handcuffs on this son-of-a- bitch and put him some place where he can't get hurt!He didn't get out. Our divers got him out...and brought him back in the chopper.You did that very well.There are only a few actors in the world who have mastered that art. Anyway, it was a good audition. You landed the part.Unless you prefer, 'Hi, Elizabeth.' Don't worry about my crew, they'll call you anything I want 'em to. Look, I'm not being callous. Burt is a fucking tragedy, but there's nothing in the world I can do about it...I've gotta have this location for three more days...and you need a place to hide.\"Burt,\" stop worrying! Haven't you heard of \"movie magic?\" That door is \"the looking glass,\" and inside...is Wonderland. You're gonna pose as a stunt man, who's posing as an actor, who's posing as a character in a movie...who's posing as an enemy soldier...In that big a crowd, who's gonna notice you? People like to believe in things and cops are just people.Frankly, your problem's so simple, it's almost beneath me. Have faith, 'Alice.' Close your eyes and enjoy.You sure he can breathe? Where's Raymond? Remember, you just crashed...you were wandering the beach behind the German lines looking for a place to hide when you saw the explosion. You're stunned by the carnage. That bomb was dropped by a guy in your squadron. Okay? Roll the film. 60 POV THRU CAMERAYeah, you got me another half-hour behind....So you heard the news about Burt...Afraid not...there's no picture ever made that's worth it.Don't know. Trying to beat the system, I guess...we all know that some day we're gonna die of nothing more important than wrinkles...and that makes us so scared and crazy, we'll do anything. Go off bridges...fight windmills...wars... anything.That's what our film's about -- or didn't you know? Hey, Burt, come over here.Not new...It's important not to let that get around as yet. So, for the time being, let's make like he's the same guy. But no longer known as \"Bad-assed Burt.\" Ever since his 'fortunate rescue,'...we call him \"Lucky.\"...Save it, everybody....Never mind. I didn't like it anyway.The scene's wrong. Call a break.It played like shit!Don't be negative, Sam. We can start a new one in time for the preview.Our picture's not about fighting wars......It's about fighting windmills.War isn't the disease...It's only one of the symptoms.That's the big question, Sam. Name the disease and you've licked the screenplay. Ask him. 'Cause he knows what the film is about. Right Lucky? Tell 'em...How'd you like Vietnam?You drafted?See, Sam? Here's another one who hates war...but he enlisted. You fought in Vietnam for two years? ...I mean actually were out there killing people...Don't be modest, Lucky. Everybody digs a little violence...What was that you said on the beach?About getting home for Thanksgiving?No, they won't.Because they know if they cut my picture, I'll kill 'em.No. I'll kill 'em and eat 'em...I hate to waste anything.Sam, my picture is the only kid I've got! If the studio said your daughter, Jennifer, would look better with her fingers chopped off, what would you do?Jake! Long time, no see. You taken care of my problem with the beach?It's at the lab, Jake.Tell the Chief it's our pleasure. Soon as it gets back...but ask him why.Tell the Chief that Burt was so busy being brilliant, he wouldn't have noticed Jesus Christ walking on the water.Hey, Burt! You got it upside down. The eyes go on top.Looks like a nice clean-cut kid.What'd he do?So long as you're back in ninety minutes. It's a work night for some of us. ...Those who give a shit.Okay, hit two and three.Got no time...it's an establishing shot...two seconds on the screen. ...You got six minutes.Hey! While you're up there, be useful. We're lighting. Stand up and look towards the sea so you're in profile!There once was a maiden fair, smooching a guy with red hair......Could it be Raymond who's turning this dame on? ...Or his double, young Lucky Pierre?Step right in, folks...the \"Killer Crane\" ride of the century.Ah, youth. Six hours in town and caught with the leading lady. Not bad. Shouldn't be so upset.You really don't trust me, do you? Hop in. I got a present for you.You constantly amaze me. You don't go to movies. What's that tatoo, a disguise? You a Commie? Don't you know that King Kong was only three feet tall? He came up to Fay Wray's belly button. If God could only do the tricks we can. What are you worried about the film and the cop for?No, your present is a piece of good advice.You've got that look again. That gleam of the sprinter about to set a record for the 50-yard dash. Is that why all those cops are chasing you? What are you, some kind of sex freak running across America with your fly open? Is that why they're after you?Button your fly and be at the airport on Sunday at three o'clock with the rest of the crew. Climb aboard our chartered 707 and fly away with us to where the setting sun bleeds into a million swimming pools a man can hide in. You do swim as well as run?...Because you're as crazy as the guy I'm doing the picture about. ...Besides, I've fallen madly in love with the dark side of your nature.Keep rolling! The clothes!...Do the clothes! 98 ANGLE ON CAMERONWhere's Raymond? Raymond, were you watching that closely?All right. We're doing the coverage. Camera here.Careful. Don't blind the eagle. I owe you six hundred bucks.What did you think?God knows, Sam. Maybe...because you get the feeling that the enemy might just be some poor horny slob like you, lookin' for the nearest whorehouse. How about that, Lucky? When that stunt man's boob hit you in the mouth, was it just another boob...or did it taste like kraut?Uh-oh, sounds like the soldier's got his feelings hurt.Oh, is that why the cops are after you? ...After all this time?Have you seen Harvey?You'll have it ready on time?Harvey in here?Can you believe this? They spend the whole day working in a whorehouse and look how they relax? That's dedication. You think sex can save the world?Sex, or saving the world?Just like the old days, huh kid? Remember the sunglasses and garter belts back when we got our start? Make you nostalgic?He just asked if he could do the rowing. Didn't you, kid?No more than you and me...it's the human condition. We just hide it better.It's just...that girl in the rowboat, she looks exactly like your daughter, Jennifer.See what I mean? Old Victoria's still got us all by the balls. God save the queen!...Only difference is, we like to make movies about it.Harvey, dailies at six o'clock tomorrow morning. We're shooting at seven.All right now, let's put a little bit of class into this production!It's so awful, it's beautiful. Wish I could use it.We goddamn well need something, Sam. Something better than we got...Wilder, crazier.They did it in \"Wings.\" Even the dummy was bored.You can't shake your finger at 'em, Sam. If you've got something to say, you better slip it in while they're laughing and crying and jacking off over the sex and violence. He should do something...outrageous!Something to catch the stink of madness behind all that good clean fun. Why the hell did we pick World War I in the first place?...The ultimate romantic insanity!Like...I don't know what! What would Lucky do if he were on the wing of that plane? Picture that because it would be a hell of a lot realer than that flapping dummy.Reality can be pretty outrageous. Look at soldier boy there, jumping off fucking buildings, risking his ass every day, doing stuff way over his head!...What would you do in that plane, Lucky, if you were about to die?Great! That's what we'll do.All right, not a jig...a Charleston......On the wing of the airplane!You're damn right...I'll do it so they'll believe it!Only when I want them to laugh!... Right, Lucky?It's not what he's eating...it's what's eating him...that makes it sort of interesting. Okay, drop the package.How is it?Okay, now level out. 119 ANGLE ON CRANE OPERATORThe graveyard's over here... ...Her car's parked here. ...Lots of these little graveyards along the roadside...most of the stones are unmarked...You're tired...you're broke...all things which meant so much are gone. What's left is a single memory... that brief bright love....You spent your month's pension in hiring the car. You just can't look for his grave any longer...so you pick one...any one. You kneel... then lay the flowers down. What have we got for her?No...something she picked herself... wildflowers or something.Sam, you'll get a belly laugh.Welcome to the picture, Sam!Cut......and print.Thank you, baby.Hey, you don't want to do it, don't do it, but be happy! It's a great day! Did you see her performance? Terrific. It's a day for humility and brotherly love!Who said that?How many feet are left in that camera?Goddamn you! How many times are you going to do this to me? How dare you yell cut on my set?It's twenty-two seconds! In twenty- two seconds, I could break your spine...I could pinch your fucking head off like an insect and smear it on the pavement...I could put twenty-two bullets in that fat gut of yours! The only thing I can't seem to do in twenty-two seconds is keep you from fucking up my film!...132 through 40 next? Sam should see this. I think I left in a line of his dialogue. Go ahead.Sweet Christ! I told 'em to hold that...Too late now...only make it worse.All right, save it. 159 ANGLE TO INCLUDE CAMERONNina. The shame of it...the shame! You've lost your son, your lover. You want to tear his throat out... but you stand meek...your guts burning with the shame of it.Honey...you better know this...don't get all shook up now...Something got screwed up...the dailies...The attic scene. The bare-ass attic scene... I'm sorry... I don't know how... it was too late to stop it... your parents......Roll film.Giddyap, soldier. Last one there's on Medicare.Trouble staying awake, huh?Stick of gum? Makes you hum! Do you read?Schickel and Bergenstadt... couple of Dutch comedy writers. See, it's got pictures. But don't skim. Chuck's gonna quiz you. If you pass, you get a free trip to Amsterdam and you can stick your finger in a dike.A pamphlet on how to get out of a sunken car. You know, they got this problem in Holland...those canals. So these guys are experts.Off hand, I'd say no, wouldn't you?There you go rejecting me again.You've gotta think positive, Burt. 165 INT. SCREENING ROOMI'm sorry, gentlemen, but I've got exactly two minutes of borrowed time. I'm in the middle of a scene. Get it started.Help yourself, the room is yours. But I've got thirty people on the set being paid for doing nothing. Come on Burt, you've got some reading to do.Something wrong? Why are you lagging?How tall is King Kong?Good boy. I got all kinds of versions. Wanna go back and see some?I've even got a version where you fly the helicopter and I'm driving the Duesenberg. It's a dilly. 166A They have now charged out of the building and are racing across the grounds toward the set.Hey, kid, what is this with you? That red dye must be eating through your scalp and affecting your brain. Why would I want to hurt you?I think it's beautiful. It's heroic! I think it's a major work that may rank with the Edsel grill! Now goddamnit, I gotta go back and do my picture! Will you take this thing and read?!Chuck keeps an eye on him.He helps me understand the kid in our story.He's like one of those land mines left over from a war, that go off from time to time. You read about it in the paper two or three years later...some kid in a bell tower shoots a dozen students for no reason at all...his mother says he was always such a good boy...I guess I'd like to know what he really did.You suppose Raymond knows how to drive a Duesenberg?Gabe, Nina...You two better wait here.Let's say you owe it to him. Until two or three days ago, I had a pretty good actor on my hands. Next time you take out the clippers, be a little humane, make sure the guy's got one to spare.Just get your greedy little ass inside and make sure you give the performance of your life. This next number, I dedicate to you...dear.Who's better, booby...him or me?Jake! Throw some water on him, quick! Only way to get 'em apart!I'm registering a complaint! Thirty- two members of my company got V.D. from your local virgins. The Chamber of Commerce didn't say anything about that in their brochure.Oh, Jake! Come on! You wouldn't know your anal invert from a hole in the ground. Raymond makes bad jokes, but they're not illegal. Christ, you've seen us all on the set...clowning around. 176 EXT. POLICE STATIONMy company's been pouring sixty thousand dollars a week into this place, for which your mayor and governor seem very grateful! We paid enough in taxes and fees alone to buy you parking meters from here to the boardwalk!Jake, I got a very horny leading lady who's got an early call and would like to spend some time with her boyfriend before she makes \"night-night.\" Now, can I please get 'em outta here before they really do something illegal...and in front of witnesses!Sorry I had to put you through that. I know it was humiliating.Yeah, that was really nice of me. I'm a nice person. I just wish I had the strength to go to his room and break his spine. On the last day of filming the queen decides to come out of the closet! Wouldn't that have made a lovely headline? You understand, of course, that the film would've been destroyed. Doing that to me...Nothing serious. Just a little self-indulgence. Feel-sorry-for- Eli-time.I'm sorry, but you know...it's too goddamn much. Why's everybody on my back? When's somebody gonna say, \"There, there Eli?\" I'm really surrounded by friends, allies and you...\"What else can I do for your film, Eli?\"What's not fair...getting my feelings \"hurt?\" When did I lose you to that soldier boy, Nina? That nice, wholesome, swell-looking kid...wanted by every cop, the FBI and God knows who else, for God knows what crime.Come on, Nina, those blue eyes have bedazzled our little girl. For Christ's sake, he reeks of blood.As who?Any number of people are trying to harm him...The R-35 in the chopper on the maxi- mount, the underwater Imo in the Duesenberg...And what about number four? Maybe hang a platform under the bridge with the speed camera?Where's the chopper? We'd kinda like to have you join us...if you can find the way.All right, everybody...may I have your attention, please?This is the one and only Duesenberg we have in stock. When that car goes into the water, we're not going to see it again. So, once the action starts, no matter what happens, keep it going....We must have this shot. Therefore, I now order no camera to jam and no cloud to pass before the sun.How ya doin', soldier? Where'd ya learn to do without sleep?Roll! Roll the film! Move your asses -- I want that shot!\"How!\" I have always had a great compassion for your people. Long before it was popular, I felt a repugnance for General Custer.My God, I think he's breathing. There're days I can't do anything right. I hope this doesn't screw up our relationship, your being alive and all.What, with Nina in the trunk? I've got scenes to shoot with her...I knew a guy who made an anti-war film. When they previewed it in his hometown, army enlistment went up six hundred percent. I'm making this film trying to convince the whole world that maybe there's a better way to get home for Thanksgiving...and I can't even convince one dumb kid with a tattoo...I couldn't have you run around paranoid the rest of your life thinking I was trying to kill you.Hey Sam, the kid just licked your screenplay. He named the disease....a social disease, very common.You're close. It's spread the same way...by screwing your fellow man.No, we're goin' in the chopper.Don't miss that plane, Burt!...What thousand bucks? That stunt paid six-fifty.Okay, seven-fifty. Split the difference...Christ! You're doing it again! Sam! This paranoid little bastard still doesn't understand your damn screenplay!Six-fifty!! Rewrite the battle scene and let the tank run him over! The stunt pays six-fifty!", "clean_line": "hey stop wiggling oh yeah story bird got divers car goddamn camera burt gone caught current probably diving downstream searching riverbanks crew yeah jesus

Right now I just wish the son-of-a- bitch could fly.Uh huh.Win what?Terrific......that's just what I needed...one more chance to lose.No!...God, don't shoot!Korea? No shit, so was my old man... Aaaaaaaargh!Thanks. I thought you didn't see me.You want me to drive?No offense...thought you might...Medic! Get the medics! 41A A WOMAN sags into a faint. A small child in the crowd is crying and clutching Cameron's leg....asshole...Hey! Hey you...! 46 CAMERON'S POVHey! Hey, give me your hand!Don't be afraid! You're gonna be okay.My God! You're...I know you...that girl from TV...the actress. Nina...My God!...Why the hell...?They gotta be crazy to cover that face.In three feet of water?Yeah, I also smoke too much.I don't know. He must've gone crazy. He tried to run me down....I didn't ask him why! All I know is he was comin' at me very fast. 'You want to get home for Thanksgiving, you better figure the guy comin' at you is tryin' to kill you'...That's one thing I learned from the gooks.That was 'Nam. What should I call 'em, WOPS? Nobody'd known what I was talkin' about.What are ya talkin' about?No...I don't.What?...Now wait!...You're not blaming me for...I didn't get a chance to say a word. I just listened.How? What about the crew? They going to look at me and say, 'Hi, Burt?'By tomorrow the local cops'll know what I look like. I can't hang around....Could be worse...could be green...I think I like it.Nope.Why not?What's she like? I've seen her on TV.What are you sore about?Not really.I got out of Vietnam in one piece. Let me tell you that wasn't a bad stunt.Seems like yesterday.Once, to save my ass, I jumped out of a banana tree into an oxcart full of buffalo shit. Does that count?Where do they go?Okie-dokie.Don't bury me yet.Show me, sergeant.Very fancy.Okay?My speciality is Hopscotch.I was running for twenty-six months with guys shooting at me...not over my head...at my head and I'm alive. I knew daredevils. I got nothing against them...it's just they're all dead. So ease off and give me a chance...Hey, were you putting me on?What's Eli got against horses? I love horses.Or my brains are all over the pavement again, right?Picture's not over. Maybe you'll still get your chance.That's supposed to hold me? Probably doesn't hold rain.Yeah, how much?Yahooo! Six-fucking-hundred-bucks!!How'd you like bubonic plague?No....Hey, I didn't kill that many people...About what?...that you better figure the guy coming at you is trying to kill you...?You mean, bang? Kill 'em, just like that?...If you'll excuse me...She sprays it every day so I look like Raymond...I didn't see a soul.I don't know about those fifty guys, but I know one weary guy who's gonna crawl upstairs and hit the sack.Hi.Not much. I guess if there were any real danger, Eli wouldn't let me do it, would he?Good. Then you jump.Well, come on.Don't worry, I'll give you a push. Isn't that what a pal's for? 77 INT. BELL TOWER - NIGHT...It's not that bad. It looks worse at night... Chuck says it's like robbing a candy store....What's wrong?Not really.So are you...and you're not even gonna jump.Thanks, I'll walk.Okay to be upset about what happened in the dining room? Why'd you promise to show that cop the film? He'll recognize me.Is this my present?Keep it.You're close. What's your advice?I'll swim like a fish. You really mean it? Why are you trying to save my ass?Why didn't you tell me about the awning? I could have been killed.Stunt men?Why didn't you tell me? Afraid I'd chicken out?Not to think I'm going crazy.If anything bothered you, be happy to do it again.I can't take my eyes off the son-of- a-bitch. Everybody does what he wants them to, even me. I feel like thankin' him 'cause I fell on my ass.It tasted lousy. But what do I know? You try it, Eli. You're the expert in bad taste.Naw, naw. I just don't know about Germans. Where I was we only raped gooks.Damn! You finally guessed it! 100A WIDER ANGLEThat's not my bag, Eli....The world, that's your special job. And Jesus, are we all lucky to have you around...Having fun with me, aren't you? It's Eli's potty training class. Show little Lucky the pretty lady. Make dirt on the pretty lady. Watch little Lucky puke. Trouble with you is you think the whole world is your own personal crapper. Have yourself a time...Just wallow around in it, man. Watching you makes me feel like Mr. Clean.How they get the film developed so fast?What's the matter?Thanks.But he can say anything and that's okay......That's great...What else? I'd dance for joy...I'd probably do a jig.How come they cast you as an old lady?Why can't I double for both of you? I could use the money and I don't look half bad.Eli might really go for that, the big soldier as a little old lady.Everything's beautiful.We've got to consider Eli. If you don't study the scene, he'll be mad...then you'll get mad...and I'll get shot out of a cannon.I want it to ring.For me, that's why. That's Eli yelling for you to work on your scene and us saying, \"Up yours, Eli,\" and I like that.I want to make love to you while Eli is screaming his head off.Betcha can.You tell 'em, Eli.But look at him struggle...That crack...in the windshield...Is this how the story was supposed to end, with the flyer dying in the water?Naw, nothin' too unusual today...get run over by a tank, blown up by a land mine, a house falls on me... Easy stuff, but I can use a rest.I wanted to, but I was scared. They're so square where I hail from. Twice is considered a love affair...didn't want to rush you.What does Eli say?Tell Eli to do it.I'm tired of being somebody's goddamn clown!Fine, Eli. Let's be brotherly. Milk brothers, sucking from the same tit.What should I congratulate you for? The fucking scene or for fucking the director?You and the entire crew, buddy....All she had to do was tell me!You telling me he banged her once three years ago?Yeah...So how's the new ending coming?...Fourteen gory ways to die?I was sort of invited to a birthday party and I can't seem to find it...and this seems to be a birthday party...She's really worth finding, ma'am. She's a very rare mineral.This morning she was acting about ninety, but she might be lying a year or two.In the same place I do?A season pass.Ya quittin'?It's a dime...am I close?Not to me, he ain't. I'm going to the cops. You gotta earn your living in pictures, but I don't give a shit. He can't hurt me.Henry, what are you talking about? I watched that whole thing today, he didn't even touch you.Nina...your crazy Eli...Is there anybody in this whole company you haven't screwed?My girl gave me her key!Then gee, ma'am, I sure hope you didn't tell him about all that ballin' last night.You couldn'a said that with your clothes on?!Did ya look in the laundry hamper?I don't have any rights? I don't have the right to be pissed off...?The word is \"fuck!\"Don't. Don't push me. I don't know this freaky world you live in, but I know that there still must be a couple of places where people somehow believe in......A place where a guy has a right to blow his top if he finds his lover screwing...Okay...okay. I just want to sit a couple of seconds without having to say a word. Because if I start trying to say, \"I'm sorry I caught you and Raymond fucking,\" I'll start laughing and when I laugh too hard, I get the hiccups and they can last for days.Isn't anything what it seems to be?...Don't you think that's kind of lousy?Where are we rushing to? I Was asleep...Short words.What the hell is this?Did Burt read this?No.I'm trying to figure it out. That film. Where was I?Three-foot-six.What about the version where I go over the bridge and die in the water?Because you don't like my tatoo.I knew a guy...who stepped on a bouncing Betty booby trap. Stepping on it wasn't his problem...they explode when you step off. So all...He had this screwy West Texas accent, I remember, \"Hey fellas...hey fellas...\"...\"Open All windows slowly to keep pressure from caving in the roof, should an unexpected skid achieve aquatic consequences...\" That's kind of witty.Beautiful...There's a second school of thought that says the first school is all wet. It says, \"Keep the windows rolled up tight and wait for the air bubble.\"He's not a cruel man. He's a crazy man. A maniac.\"The water pressure at two hundred feet can crush a man into the size of an egg.\" He wants to get that on film....so he's gonna kill me.It's a rotten shame about your folks and your naked ass, but dying always scared me a little, okay?Did you know that Eli almost strangled a man because he stopped the camera when Burt got killed?!...I saw the bruises!She saw the tears! Did you ask him what he was crying about?! 'Cause you can bet your sweet tits, it wasn't over Burt. He was crying over losing his fucking shot!And you know what? You want the shock of your life...? I understand what the son-of-a-bitch is saying, and he may be right...which makes me what? Minus twelve, the dumb schmuck with a gun. That doesn't change the fact that he's crazy. If he had his way, there wouldn't be a soldier left alive by morning. ButHi...hello?Okay, Chuck. I'll meet you in an hour. For me. Amazing how they keep secrets around here.What if I told you I wasn't going to do the stunt?And what if I told you I was gonna get out of here tonight...and that I want you to come with me?What if I can't wait?That's a shame.Why not? You built a stunt man out of one.He sure as hell convinced me.Let me catch my breath.Hey, Chuck, you blind?...Can't you see I've got my respirator on?That's the best news I've heard. Let's hope it's a felony.For what?Nina?How'd you know I was down here?How about that for luck? Burt's from Idaho...no picture on the driver's license.Name it...Hey, how's this? A World War One, uh...what did they call 'em?... dogfaces... somethin'... doughboys. Wanna be the nurse? 179A From some hospital props, he grabs a wheelchair and shoves it toward her....You tell me this wouldn't work? A pretty nurse pushing a vet in a wheelchair? When we hit that roadblock, we'd have 'em crying like babies.Somebody trying to stay alive...anybody--that can get past the dogs and the quicksand... Who did Eli say I was?Easy with that tatoo...it mighta lost me Eli, but it won me Lt. Emily Schmidt, the greatest boobs in Southeast Asia...and a very patriotic chick. So I got this tattoo, for 28 bucks. And when she saw this shoulder, let me tell ya, holy Jesus! Following which I got the clap from the Lt. And hepatitis from the tattoo needle. You know what bothers me? I think Emily is gonna be very offended by Eli's picture.Eli'd tell you...I was a soldier. I did the same as everybody, just one of the boys... emptied my M-16 at any sound... don't know whether I killed gooks or cherries...the new kids from the States, we call 'em cherries, which they were for maybe fifteen minutes. The dry season is when it really breaks loose. You get very tired. It's like falling asleep at the wheel. You close your eyes and it still goes on. You're killin' them, they're killin' you. Couldn't tell ya now what was real except I'm here.Hey, once when things were rough and the grass ran out, I shot the hell out of a water buffalo. Actually, I wasn't a bad soldier...better than most. Got lotsa pretty ribbons. Funny...sort of like when I did that first stunt and everybody started clapping... nothing like a slap on the back to ruin a man, blow his sense of proportion. So, I got home...and, uh...I guess I expected something. Nothing fancy, but... something, you know...a free car wash, double blue chip stamps, extra time on the parking meter... I don't know... Instead, people... uh, didn't seem too pleased. In fact, they acted like I was gonna start killing babies...Shit. I was supposed to get married, run an ice cream parlor. I gotta go.I'll go through the woods.I suppose there are cops in the woodwork! But what the hell...it's a nice night.You said \"we.\" What about your two scenes?Nina, you're making me crazy.The charge was attempted murder. I bashed this cop's head in. It took the jury about two fucking minutes. It could of been worse. It could of been life. But the judge...he looked real nice at me, and said you were a damn good soldier, son...So he only gave me twenty years. No way! Enough!...You know how long I was in that prison -- nineteen months -- and then I was gone! I was gone!Caught me breaking into a store...oh, not to rob it...I went there to kill the bastard who owned it......Because... 179D Suddenly the ice turns to steam. His self-control shatters like glass. There in the basement of a 100-year old hotel, before an audience of one, Cameron ERUPTS, spewing out the memory of his mortification and crucifixion...not without the silent resignation of Jesus, but with the howling rage of a mad dog...Pluto with the rabies......Because...it seemed like a good idea to twist his fucking head off! Said I could be his partner when I got back...lyin' son of a bitch was \"real sorry things were slack...\" Slack my ass...he just didn't want me hangin' around because he was bangin' my old lady. So I go down and start bangin' on his door!...He's closed. It's two o'clock in the morning. I want to smash his face in and he's closed! \"OPEN UP, YOU BASTARD.\"Bang! That bright, shiny front window went bye-bye! ...Maybe he's screwin' her behind the counter...I climb in there screamin' \"WHERE ARE YA? Come out here and be a man! Where are ya? Behind that counter, you son-of-a- bitch?\"Ya know what's behind that counter?......And these little Mickey Mouse faces on the walls!...with candy eyeballs!...I smashed that fucking fudge pot across the room, smack into that shelf full of animals...and it starts raining pussycats and monkeys and kangaroo cookies like Noah's Ark!\"How long should a girl wait\" she says? FOR GODDAMN EVER, BITCH, THAT'S HOW LONG!I picked up this fifty-pound ice cream vat...FLAVOR-OF-THE-MONTH!... ROYAL-BAVARIAN-CHOCOLATE-MIST!...and I started running with that son-of- a-bitch... 179GSCOOP THAT UP YOUR ROYAL BAVARIAN STRAWBERRY SNATCH!It's not funny!You'll miss the main part! Killer Cameron's ghastly crime! I was freaked out of my head! And, suddenly there's this big flashlight shining in my face. I just grabbed that goddamn ice cream bucket and slopped it...right over the guy's head!It's not funny. It wasn't him. It was a cop. I got out of there like a shot. I didn't know he was knocked out. How the hell did I know he was gonna lay there all night with his head in the ice cream?No, he's in the hospital.Oh, yes. That ice cream's goddamn cold! His nose...it froze and his ear froze, see...and...No, it's terrible!...He lost the tip of his nose and his ear lobe...I'll tell ya, it's a bad year to mess with cops. You get the FBI screaming down on your ass......If we woke up Eli and told him about the ice cream...would he forgive me and call off the stunt?... 180 INT. GARAGE - PRE-DAWNHow the hell d'ya open this thing?We know it's locked. Would you open up for us?Why not?I think the lady had her heart set on pancakes, but thanks.I can't believe it...He knows. The son-of-a-bitch knows whatever I'm thinking. I'm beginning to feel like something that Sam wrote! I'm not real. I'm some jerk American flyer from World War I who has to go over a bridge and die because the goddamn script says so! It's crazy...I'm trapped in his goddamn story. If somebody lost that page, I'd be fine. If he crossed it out and wrote something else like -- \"At the last moment, he veers the big car from the railing--then goes speeding on to live happy ever after...\" ...How about that?! Empty road, me out there all alone, the crew 'way back, breathless as I approach the bridge. And then...\"Hey, what happened?!\" A fucking rewrite's what happened! I'll have a fifteen- minute jump on them before they figure out they're shooting a new version!How?Nina, get out of the trunk....Get out of the trunk.It's my nightmare...Stay out! This isn't the time to solve your neurotic problems! I'm trying to stay alive!Oh, for Christ's sake...Nina, please, there's somebody coming. Get out of the trunk...Wanna check?Hope those are really blanks.What?Yahooo! Hang on to everything, baby, we're on our way! You okay?Shoot this, Eli!Ninaaa-a-a-a-a-!!!Those guys down there the whole time?Tunafish salad...I know.Just as well!...You sure took a hell of a chance, Eli...why didn't you just let me go last night?...All right. This morning then. Chuck could have done the stunt.Paranoid?I hope you find an easier cure. That was the hardest thousand bucks I ever made.Thanks, Eli, but that looks too dangerous. I think I'll ride with Jake. Good luck with the picture.Chuck told me a thousand...A thousand!Bullshit! You're trying to screw me!!That's your big problem, Eli! You use people! I want my money, a thousand bucks!Come back here. I'm tired of being your goddamn clown!

film...I'm only old at the end of the story.No, don't do that. Rescue me!Oh come on, please. I always wanted someone to rescue me from something...Oh hell, it's all ruined now and I wanted you to see the makeup, Eli. Where were you?...I even got Raymond's autograph and he didn't know...You'd have been proud...Hey! Thank you! That was really gallant...rescuing an old lady!We should have waited, it wouldn't have been an hour. 74A They've entered the hotel. Cameron continues to the bottom of the stairs, hesitates, looking back at Nina. 75 CAMERON'S POVYes. It does look pretty high. Are you worried about tomorrow?No. I'm sure it's safe.Okay.What, right now?Wait, I'm afraid of heights! What if I freeze up?Oh, my God! It's terrifying! You can't jump from this...you'll get killed! It's crazy!...Now stop that! ...I'm going back.It's just dumb...to strut around trying to talk brave...Yes. You are...You're trembling.Light this, Eli!!! 80 EXT. CHURCHYARD - BENEATH THE TOWER - NIGHT...And those bells are so interesting. Imagine four hundred years ago by boat from Amsterdam. Thank you for the tour. It was so informative. I'm going to write my father. He's so interested in God and things like that.Oh, for Christ's sake...Eli, get away with that thing!It's gotten to the point where I have to look under the stopper of the bathtub when I take a shower to make sure I've got some privacy! Thank you one and all and good night!I'm so proud of you...I could just die!What's happening? What's going on?That's a daring touch, Raymond! The rowboat. Terribly symbolic.Hi Lancelot. What's a nice boy like you doing in a place like this? Going to rescue the maiden from the boat?Don't let the fact that Eli treats you as an equal go to your head. You're not!I'm sorry, Eli....That's right......What goes on in that dim little head of yours? How dare you open your mouth to him like that? Have you the vaguest idea what he's trying to say to people with this film?!...That man is the most dedicated, kindest...!That's twice for me today. Now. And when I watched you do the stunt.I have to study my scene for tomorrow. The Old Lady at the cemetery. It's brutal. I set the clock in case we dozed off.I start out as a young girl hiding this American flyer. I'm Austrian... Will ya turn off the clock?Anyway, his patriotism is stronger than his love and he leaves me with another little patriot in my belly.Honey, you'll ruin it. Take it off.The clock's electric. It'll ring forever.What's wrong?What are you doing?Did you fall on your head today?Why?Do you want to leave?I can't make love with the clock ringing....I can't tell you how pleased I was with your conduct. When you congratulated me after my scene this afternoon, all the other glowing tributes faded to nothing... 139 WIDER ANGLE - INT. CAMERON'S AND SAM'S ROOM...Nevertheless, I'm cancelling your invitation to an intimate party given by my parents, who arrived unexpectedly to honor me on the occasion of my birthday...but don't feel too badly. As consolation for a lovely evening missed, I'm presenting you with the \"good-sport- of-the-month\" award.Mr. Baum, will you notify this young savage that it's customary to cover one's privates when accepting an award? It's one of the common courtesies, like...congratulating people.For fucking the director, honey. Didn't you know that's how little girls get into the movies?I'm sorry it got so late...that damn five o'clock makeup call...I feel as bad as you do...Will you take a raincheck? ...A permanent one?Good night.Get out of here!Get out!!! I'll have you thrown out!I am not your girl! I am that man's girl! That man and I have been lovers for six months! I've known you two days!Don't you dare be clever with me! He came scratching at the door tonight like a beaten dog, begging me to say that you were some twenty- four hour nonsense. ...and I had to tell him I thought I was falling in love with...Goddamn you! The wounded stud! He is entitled to some dignity! To lose his \"pure and faithful lover\" without the new boy barging in! Where do you suppose he is now?GET OUT! Get the HELL OUT!!You don't have the right to breathe! I knew him before I met you! Do you understand that?! Before I met you!! If we were frightened, we woke each other in the dark...we slept in each other's arms...All right, the word is fuck! You narrow, insensitive, stupid...!Believe in what? You're blushing. A place where what? Don't get embarrassed at this late date!Raymond's lover! Raymond's lover! Say it! Raymond's lover!I'll have it typed up and notarized...! Raymond's lover! And you will sign where it says, agreed!You won't turn me into some rotten whore because your papa once told that a woman is a certain way \"and that's how it's gonna be 'til Gabriel blows his horn...\"Don't get hiccups.No...Yes...God, I don't know what's wrong with me.What?...It was so unnecessary...For Christ's sake, I'm no shrinking violet...I've had my ass pinched black and blue by account execs for not showing enough enthusiasm for Vitalis. But this from Eli...it was so pointless...sadistic...Say it was an accident...benefit of the doubt. But then to use me that way...like a gadget...Why would Eli do that? He's not a cruel man...What?What in God's name are you babbling about?!What is going on in that head of yours?! You take the word of some...malcontent...technician!...And I saw Eli that night when he had to tell Burt's brother on the phone...I saw the tears.Didn't they give I.Q. tests in the army? What did you get...minus twelve? Haven't you figured out yet why he's working himself to death? What his film is all about? He's trying to tell people not to kill each other!Stop it...sweetheart...I'd die if anything happened to you.It's my father...I won't talk to him...You're all driving me crazy...I won't talk to him.!Tell them I'm not here. Tell them anything. Tell them I'm working.I'd say fine.But there's just one more day of shooting...I...I have two more scenes......I could meet you......Look, don't do the stunt! If you believe Eli's a killer, call the police...Why are you doing this to me? That's all I need right now, with all I've been through!...For you to give me now-or-never ultimatums and tell me my director is insane!...I hate this, damn it! Couldn't you have done it without me?What did you want me to do? Take him in the back room and unzip his fly every time he fluffed a line? What else can I do for your film?...It was awful...I hated it. But you did save that man's life.Eli, what's wrong?That's not fair.You sound as crazy as...He thinks you're trying to... ...harm him.The desk clerk...Who are you?Who the hell are you?I'm asking you, God damn...Why do they want you? What did you do?...What about the roadblocks?Don't you suppose there'll be cops in the woods.I've always liked the woods at night. They're very romantic... You can hunt for truffles. It might be such fun, we'd just keep going.That's true...One of them is three pages of me making a tunafish salad for an American flyer in 1917... And I've got to weigh that against losing the man I love. It's a big decision.I'm sorry. I'm a little crazy myself. I can't let you go and I don't even know who you are. Why are they chasing you?! What have you done? What happens to me in the woods? Will I need a bayonet too? 179C He stands there, staring at her, his face suddenly savage. After everything, the lady is afraid of him. He picks up the duffel bag and moves for the door, then turns on her, punishing her with his words.Why?Your hand!Oh, baby...Let me go to the bathroom. I'm gonna have an accident.Oh, my God. He died?Oh, no.Oh, God. Too late...Thanks a lot!I'm sure Mr. Cross will understand when you tell him that Miss Franklin had a sudden desire for Swedish pancakes for breakfast and this gentleman had a sudden desire to keep me company...I'm Nina Franklin, the star of the film.That's all right, we'll find some place.Then we'll drive to Cape Long.Are you telling me that if I decide to take a drive at any time of the day or night or whenever I damn please, I need Mr. Cross's permission? Mr. Cross does not control me or anyone else, including this gentleman and he does not control the public roads!...And what about the love story? What happens to the Austrian girl? People will leave the movie feeling terrible...I know! She goes with him!In here.No...look... See how big it is? Comfortable, too...Honestly, honey, it's a better ending.And what happens in the morning? Do I show up on the set in my little pink pinafore and say, \"Hi, Eli. Where's my hug and kiss...?\" How do I do that now?...Or should I trot up to my room to catch a couple of winks and cuddle up with a dozen sleeping pills?So am I. And I never claimed not to have \"neurotic problems!\"I can't come any further. What should I do? I'll get the dress all muddy and I need it for the next scene.They found me five minutes after you left. I felt ridiculous.When Eli told me you'd changed your mind and decided to do the stunt, at first I didn't believe him, but I guess you really did. I tried to find you.I'm sure glad you two made up!

It's a little different running across that roof when they're pumping tracer bullets over your head.Me? I wouldn't know how to do that.Can you imaging Eli doing a World War I picture without horses? Do you know the gags I could do with four runaway horses pulling a caisson?...Next time hit me higher.Don't butter me up.We'll draw a sight line for you to follow down the roof here, while you're rolling. Now there's nothing very difficult. But this is where you gotta think. Your mind can't be on snatch. It's gotta be on grabbing that gutter.You know a good falling horse makes more money in four minutes than a bank president does in a year?Naw, all they care about is story. 64ANow here's where the scuffle ends. When the pipe breaks loose, you fall and hit that awning. Then Eli yells \"cut\" and old Raymond takes your place for the close-ups and the glory. That's where the German soldiers catch him and throw him in the nuthouse. They're shootin' that scene downstairs now.It's not a real awning, it's a catcher.You're stealing candy with this gag. You get six hundred bucks....Christ! Watch it, will ya? What did you think a stunt man is? He's a professional. If the camera jams, that's another six hundred and if Eli says \"try it again,\" six hundred more.Go!...Go!No chance. You were in your mother's arms from the time you hit the sugarglass skylight. Those stunt men you fell on would have got you out of anything.The one with the tits and the other guy.Eli likes some things spontaneous. Makes 'em more believable. You're okay. Whaddya want?...It's just a crush. You'll get over it.Crazy bastard!There was no way it could go wrong...unless he just went ape.The harness is okay...the roof is holding...it all seems fine....Badly. Eli wouldn't use a foot of it...poor slob died for nothin'.Shit. That's where it stops. That fuckin' Henry...got spooked and took his finger off the remote button.Sure as shit ended that way for Burt, didn't it?Change of plans. We're making the stunt a fire gag. When you come out of the barn, you're in flames...wanna try it.Look, don't do it if you don't wanna...You know Eli... \"Tell the soldier it's an extra hundred bucks and he'll do it without the asbestos.\" Whaddya say?Hey, what the hell is wrong with you?Look at this mother...I'll bet these guys could build an Arabian out of a jackass.Stunt man? Three days and you've already grown those big brass balls? Jump up and down and let me hear 'em clang, and then do me a favor and leave 'em home for this gag. There's just enough room in that Duesenberg for a normal guy...who thinks! Show me how long you can hold your breath.Now, look around. Whaddya see?...No roll bar in the roof. That's because the roof caving in really looks gassy on film. You got your protection in the back of the seat...steel sheeting. If the roof goes too far, you get your goddamn head down quick! You listening to me?!...Nod Your head. You got good lungs. You got no shoulder harness because it would show on camera. So when you hit the water, you brace yourself against the steering wheel. It's reinforced. You couldn't break it loose with dynamite...you gettin' light-headed yet?Keep your hands off the doors... You're leaving through the window. You lower them slowly as you sink to equalize the pressure. What are you waitin' for? I'm not gonna be down there holding your hand. Slower. When you hit bottom, the windows are open and you're gonna make like a minnow. But first, a little fresh air wouldn't hurt. You reach down under the seat and, what do you know, a respirator...Make like you're reaching for it. There'll be one there tomorrow.No, keep your face forward, the camera is behind you and it's still running.You feel like your lungs are gonna burst? Good. That's the way you're supposed to act like you feel. The moment that water gets above your nose, you gotta look like you're drowning. Remember? Burt wasn't so good at that.Things happen crossin' the street! If somethin' goes cockeyed...screw the scene! Get that mask on. There's enough oxygen to get you to China. We'll try it again.What you'll catch is a lungful of water! You're at the bottom of the river!...You breathe when I goddamn tell you to breathe!You just goddamn remember you don't have gills!!What?!! Eli's at the police station!He needs Gabe. They're lookin' for a driver so I'm gonna take him. Come on with me.You and me are gonna talk about windows and oxygen and seat belts and things like that. And if you're a good boy and listen and don't be a smart ass, maybe I'll let you sit in the back seat with Nina Franklin.You might even get to hold hands.You're lookin' real strong, kid. Is that loose change I hear jinglin' or are they beginnin' to grow?C'mon, lemme show you this truck...I'm sending it on ahead. During the gag, it's gonna be comin' down the road towards you when you get to the bridge.Relax, what does it change? I'm only tellin' you so you don't buzz off into space when you see 'em. They'll be shooting at you and that's what's supposed to make you go into the river.Yeah, a cop'll do anything for fifty bucks, even be an actor.Shit...forget it. How much'll they see from the helicopter?That crazy bastard! Who cued him?Take a belt. Don't be stingy.I can't hear ya...they're clangin' too loud.Lover, I think your circulation's back to normal.
