{"Last-Boy-Scout-The": {"HALLENBECK": {"raw_line": "sits bolt upright and grabs the Kid and stuffs a .38 revolver in the Kid's face and cocks it.Hey, motherfucker. The Kid, of course, shrieks. And the light of sanity dawns in Hallenbeck's eyes. He sucks in a deep breath. Releases the struggling Kid. Swears under his breath. Watches the boys flee in terror. Notices a dead squirrel in his lap. Scowls. Heaves it out the window. Pumps a Camel into his mouth. Lights it. Rescues the bottle of Seagrams.You're on my property, kid. KID #3 Sidewalk belongs to the government. Hallenbeck stares at him. Smiles weakly.Excuse me. He leans over and vomits on the lawn. One hand gripping the car fender. The sprinkler goes round and round.Hallenbeck Investigations.Mmmmm.Sat in the car. Looked at the sky. Got hammered.I killed a squirrel and don't even remember.Tell me about it. Look, I crawled out of a perfectly good bottle to answer the phone, what the fuck do you want?No pride here. What'cha got?Make her a one on your nose scale. Improve your looks.I was gonna smoke some cigarettes.These are really good cigarettes.Gimmee the address.Gimmee the address.'Morning, gorgeous. Gorgeous does not respond: Coy. Very coy. Hallenbeck slides behind the wheel of his Plymouth. KEYS the IGNITION. Phil Woods' SAXOPHONE fills the air. He looks at himself in the mirror.Nobody likes you. Everybody hates you. You're an asshole and you're stupid. You're gonna lose. Smile, you fuck. He stretches his mouth into a grimace. Pulls out into the street. Off he goes. CUT TO:My ears are burning, Andy. Even as we speak, someone, somewhere is calling me an asshole.I'm playing Tahoe on the 15th.I was.Office. He brushes past her and crosses to the bed. On the pillow, a big stuffed cat toy smiles benignly.Hey, Furry Tom. He sits on the bed. Lights a cigarette. Opens the night stand and removes a speedloader for his .38. Starts to load the gun.I wasn't there to gamble. I was doing a skip trace.Fifty bucks. He suddenly notices a sheet of paper on the night stand. A crayon sketch. He picks it up, frowns:What's this?You okay, Sarah...?Hmmmm. Well, I think the kid will be fine. Boys still tease her about the headgear?She'll be fucking them by the time she's fourteen.Well, Christ, you let her wear enough makeup. The kid looks like a goddamn raccoon. She comes in late at night, I think, 'Christ, a burglar.' I almost shot her twice.Yeah, but they don't apply it with a paint sprayer. And for your information, our neighbors think I'm very funny.Don't tempt me. He tosses the holstered .38 on the bed. Stalks into the bathroom.Damn raccoon. He sighs, tosses his cigarette butt in the toilet. Walks back out into the bedroom.Who's the guy in the closet? Sarah stops dead. Spins and stares at him.Oh, that's right, you sometimes forget that I'm a detective. See, first I noticed how tense you were, but I let that pass. Then I noticed there was steam in the shower like someone was just in there, but meanwhile your hair is completely dry, you follow? So. Why the steamy shower?Because someone else was in there, right, and since he's not under the bed you must have stuck him in the closet when you heard my key in the door a day early. Tah-dah. Please, no applause. A silence hangs between them. Sarah just stares. Shakes her head.Mmmmm. I'm sorry, honey, I don't enjoy being observant, but someone's gotta do it. What's his name?It's okay, I've seen you naked. So, apparently, has someone else. What's his name?Is this a trick question?No. We won't open the door.Nope. Door stays shut. Instead, what I'm gonna do is... (he scoops up the ... I'm gonna count to three, and then I'm gonna put a bullet in there, and you can stop me anytime by speaking the truth. One.Two. The truth is a beautiful thing. He cocks the hammer. Arm extended, hand rock steady.Three. Last chance.Hello, Mike. Keeping her warm for me? The gun barrel does not waver. Not an inch.How as she, Mike? On your finger scale, how was my wife...?You call me from here this morning?When you found out I was back. Why didn't you split?Normally I wouldn't.I suspected. So how about it, Mike? On a scale of one to ten. How was she?How long? Mmm. I'd say roughly until you put your dick in my wife.I know, I know, it just happened. It was an accident. Sure. You tripped. You said, 'Whoops,' and accidentally fucked my wife. Gee, Mrs. H., I'm sorry, just isn't my week. Sure, Mike. Happen to anybody. I don't gotta understand anything. Sarah speaks then. Head down. Eyes averted.Hmmm? Oh, right, the gun. You're right, Sarah, I'm acting nuts. He pulls the trigger. The SHOT is DEAFENING in the closed room. Mike Miller screams and clutches at himself. The bullet goes high and wide. Over his head. On the wall is a framed wedding photo. The twin of the one in Hallenbeck's office. The bullet strikes it dead center. Blows it to pieces. Silence. The tinkle of glass hitting the floor. Hallenbeck turns. Regards his wife with hooded, lifeless eyes.Where was Darian?Let's take a walk, Buddy.Where you want it, Mike? Head or gut?If I see you again, I'll kill you. Miller nods weakly. Gasping for breath.So. West Hollywood at seven, right?The job. Seven o'clock, right?It's two hundred bucks.He came by to talk business. He had a case he was to busy to continue with, a routine surveillance. He farmed it out to me.Yeah. That's all. He looks the Officer in the eye. Betrays nothing.The police won't help you, huh?Guess you don't want to wait that long.They only play this kind of music?Pat Boone? The Four Freshmen?Yes, I'm your father. Get your clothes on. I hate this funk shit. It's gonna be an extra hundred bucks.The screaming part I believe.sits with his drink untouched before him. Pats his suit pockets, searching for a smoke. Removes a crumpled, empty pack, as:Shhh. Don't tell anyone.Easy, Junior, I'm not raining on your parade. She's too young for me. I'm just keeping an eye on her for a few days.Something like that. You got a cigarette?I hope not. You tell me.Mmmm. That bothers you, doesn't it?Don't sweat it. Women have secrets. Water is wet, the sky is blue, and women have secrets. I'll buy you a beer. Sit down. Jimmy remains standing.Yeah. Actually, she hired my buddy Mike. I'm filling in.He died.Don't be. He was a lousy surveillance man. Jimmy leans forward, palms flat on the table.That's client confidential.Nope.Do it.You don't like my suit, guess what? I don't like your money.Story of my life.Not getting any. They stare each other down. Hallenbeck calmly sips his bourbon.Hit me.Hit me. Bust me in the chops, chickenshit. You're not afraid, are you, Jimmy...?James Alexander Dix, L.A. Stallions, '86 and '87. Barred from the N.F.L. on gambling charges. Allegations of point shaving to support a cocaine habit, never proven.Busted once for possession. You had the makings of a first class dumbshit.About fucking time. Joe Hallenbeck. I'm a private detective.At least I didn't shit my talent away on coke, motherfucker.Absolutely. Jimmy throws a short jab at Hallenbeck's chin. It never gets there. Joe moves, lightning quick, and suddenly Jimmy's fist is trapped. Dead stops. Fingers grinding into palm. Jimmy swears. Stumbles. Sits down hard. Hallenbeck releases him.Please, have a seat.It's not a question of tough. I'm bigger than you, and I was trained. So I can take you. That's just the way it is. You can throw a better pass. How about that beer?You were a great quarterback, Jimmy. I watched you play at Washington State. Red shirt freshman in '82. Followed you with the Stallions. Good scrambling ability, seventy percent completions from the pocket... You had the best gun in the N.F.L. Jimmy looks at him, puzzled. Didn't they just swap punches?Hell. I'm a fan.I didn't vote for you, you bastard. He looks away, and suddenly notices something on the ground: A half-smoked cigarette butt. Just sitting there. Joe stares at it. Thinks it over. Starts to walk away. Stops.You're a fuckin' lowlife, Joe.That's what you think. Last night I fucked your wife. The gunman cracks up. Hallenbeck grins drunkenly.She said her husband was a greaseball with bad breath. The guy cracks up again.After fucking your wife, I'll take two. The hitman wheezes laughter. Joe just grins.Are you kidding? We barely know each other. The hitman is now giggling, shaking his head.You need a special funny bullet.That's what your wife said.Ask me how fat she is.She's so fat I had to roll her in flour and look for the wet spot. You wanna fuck her, you gotta slap her thigh and ride the wave in. Like the Pillsbury doughboy, except when you poke her in the stomach, she farts. I got a buddy he's an archaeologist, organized an expedition to her chin. They got lost in her nasal hair. But seriously, her eyes are like the streets of Paris: crossed. They're so crossed when she cries the tears run down her back. She's got back-tearia.And then some. The guy pitches over dead. Hallenbeck kneels beside him. Retrieves his .38, holsters it. Slips the hitman's pistol into his waistband.I'm playing Tahoe on the 15th. He takes off running.Move!!Hey. Back up.It's all over, compadre.Sidewalk belongs to the government. He turns and looks at Jimmy. The kid is in pain. Staring at Cory's bullet-riddled body. Eyes glazed. Hallenbeck says nothing. He crosses to the shattered Hitman. Kneels down, fishes through the guy's coat pockets. Comes up with a bloody pack of cigarettes. Extracts one. Lights it. SIRENS fill the air. And Jimmy snaps out of it long enough to reach into his coat -- Takes out the vial of coke. Ditches it. Drops it down a sewer grating, out of sight. No one sees him do it.Yeah. I don't know what she was into, but those were professional hitters tonight. Mob style. Tell me about Cory. What was she like?Listen up, friend. I'm trying to get a handle on this. How was she fixed for money?Always kept an eye out for work?It isn't. Tell me what she did at the club, besides dance.She get many high rollers?Fine. So suppose one night, her 'guest' gets a little too drunk, and brags to her... reveals something about himself. Something that could hurt if it came out. What would she do?Would she blackmail him?Would she consider the possibility of blackmail?Right. So what does she do?Bingo. Kid, this is making sense. She hires somebody to follow the mark and obtain blackmail evidence.Ah. She hires my buddy Mike. Right? Right. It makes sense. Except --Exactly. He got spotted. They made him, and they killed him. Then they took out Cory.Whatever it was, it was way over their heads. They knew they were in trouble.Because Mike was scared. He bailed out and threw the case in my lap.He was fucking my wife, Jimmy. I die. He gets my wife.Glad to see, at a time like this, at least you got your priorities straight.Get some sleep.Fuck you. They start down the hallway, side by side.How's this? Fuck you and the horse that looks like you.We gotta cross the parking lot. You wanna borrow my sunglasses?Hey, snappy comeback. You a detective? As the two cross the muster room toward the front doors, they pass the hooker we saw earlier. She is talking to her pimp. There is a heated exchange. The pimp slaps her. Hard. Suddenly, Jimmy lunges forward. Balling his fists.What the fuck are you trying to do, Tarzan?You don't start a fight in a police station, dickhead. Are you really this stupid or did you take lessons?Why? Because they're weak and need protecting?Yes.Take the bus.I'm not thirsty. Good night. He approaches his battered Plymouth. Jimmy scowls.Go home. Get some sleep.I'm gonna get a message to the people who killed your friend.That we're out of it. That whatever they're doing, they don't have to worry about us.The kind with a wife and kid. Look, it's over. My job is done.Yes, it was very exciting. Tomorow I'll take you to the zoo. You wanna play hero, go ahead. When you die, I'll take your closet full of eighty-dollar shirts.The hell you are.Have a ncie night. He STARTS the CAR.Tell them what, Jimmy?You little creep, I'm gonna beat the shit out of you.You and me is not a fight. You and me is a massacre.Get in the fucking car.Mmmm. Used to be a pretty fair ventriloquist.Yeah, well, actually --Ear problems.The kind that won't shut up. He stops at a traffic light. Sees a torn poster on a nearby telephone pole: CALIFORNIA HAS A VOICE - BAYNARD FOR SENATE. He grumbles. Gives it the finger.You might say that.Bastard got me fired from my old job.Secret Service.That's me. Every night. Where did Cory live?I want to check it out. Jimmy stares at him, puzzled.Look, dipshit, I told you that to keep you out of my hair. My client's dead and I haven't earned my fee.Yeah, I'm a prince. Shut the fuck up.Bet these places run a fortune.How charming. Sounds like a great girl. What else did you spring for? Clothes? Car payments?Oh. Love. Well, forget about it, then.I believe in cancer. I believe in love.Something like that. Jimmy shakes his head sadly.I'm sure she'd love meeting you. Probably blow you on the front porch.Eat shit.The cops are gonna want to check this place out, so don't disturb anything.Well, shit. Looks like somebody beat us to it.Whatever evidence Cory was holding.Where you going?I'll pass. Hallenbeck starts inspecting the wreckage.Looks like you made it, baby. Jimmy emerges from the bathroom.Yeah, there's some really nice rubble.What?Where the hell are you going?You got the keys?Cory has two cars?Jimmy, no!! He sprints across the sidewalk and yanks Jimmy out of the driver's seat before he can key the ignition.They used a car bomb on Mike, it figures they'd try it on her, too. Except they wired the wrong car. Jimmy pales noticeably.Easy, kid. No harm, no foul. We caught it in time. He strolls toward his Plymouth, whistling. Cheerfully unaffected. Jimmy catches his breath. Swallows hard. Turns, and bumps into Hallenbeck, coming back the other way.Gotta disconnect the fucker.Relax, Junior, I used to do this for a living. He isolates one wire. Turns and offers the cutters to Jimmy.You wanna do it?Come on, chickenshit. Just snip the wire. Jimmy hesitates, then takes the cutters. Reaches beneath the wheel well. Plucks at the wire tentatively. Cuts.Oh, shit not that one! Jimmy screams and stumbles backward. Lands on his ass. Hallenbeck is chuckling softly. Shakes his head as he walks around to release the hood.And then some, Junior. And then some. TIME CUT TO:We'll hand this over to the cops. They can analyze it.You tell me, kid.I got a better idea. Let's check in with my family. They start walking toward Hallenbeck's Plymouth. Hallenbeck tosses the car keys to Jimmy.I'm tired. You drive.Yeah. Little girl.Not much, no. And she likes Prince, so go figure.Great, you can marry my daughter. Or better yet, fuck my wife. I hear all it takes is a credit card and two valid I.D.'s. Open the trunk.You're right. Let's leave it here for the neighborhood kids to play with. Jimmy opens the trunk. As he does, however, a voice rings out suddenly from the darkness.No, Jimmy. It's not the cops.Yeah, you two better be getting home.No, I don't believe you have. He'd like to have the pleasure.He says it's --I'm asshole. He's fuckface.Easy... Jim... All they want is the evidence...Great word.Give up, Jimmy. We're dealing with geniuses.Back off, Jimmy. The Tall Man turns and eyes Jimmy.Wait! Hallenbeck speaks through cracked, bloody lips:You want the fucking evidence that the stripper had. I've got it. So we can play games, or I can hand it over.Hand me the car keys, Jimmy. Jimmy stumbles to his feet. Looks at the Tall Man.The evidence is in the trunk.I don't think so. He turns and throws the keys as far as he can. They fall out of sight behind a cottage.Oops. I guess nobody gets it.You alive?Either that, or we're looking at a major factory recall.Right.Yeah. Hooray. He spits blood as SIRENS once more fill the night air,Get the fuck out of here, I'll take the heat on this one. Rent a car. Then go home and wait for my call. Do it. Jimmy meets Joe's eyes. Nods. Dashes off into the night. CUT TO:Forget about him. Look at the guy on the right.Senator Calvin Baynard. Jimmy draws a sharp breath. Pause, then:Take it easy, kid. It's not so bad.When I was thirty, I was on the President's personal security force. Once night I was on the way home from a late session. I'm on the highway just outside of Georgetown when I see something up ahead.It was a high-speed collision. Both cars were totaled. The woman and the boy were dead. The driver of the other car wasn't.I could smell bourbon on him, big time. He was standing there, not a scratch on him. I went a little nuts. I hit him. In SLOW MOTION, Hallenbeck backhands the rich drunk, with a head-snapping impact that bursts lips. Breaks teeth. We see the Drunk's head slowly strike the asphalt. A sickening concussion.The blow was non-lethal. But when he fell, his head hit the pavement funny. Put him in a coma.Even when he came out of it, he was never right in the head. His dad fixed everything with the cops. The accident report disappeared. A week later the police found half a kilo of crack cocaine planted in my house. Acting on an anonymous tip.And my pension. And my marriage. Only reason I'm still licensed to carry a gun, the man himself made a few calls. Since then I'm just playing it out. Day by day. Jimmy is silent for a moment. Then:Not yet. I need more evidence. I want Baynard, Jimmy. I want to bring him down. I could use your help.Because if Baynard takes a fall, so does Marcon. The man who kicked you out of professional football.She's like thirteen. And if you even look at her funny, I'll shove an umbrella up your ass and open it.First things first. I'm starving. Hey, kiddo. Why aren't you in bed?I can see that.She's pissed off because I wouldn't let her go out on a date with her friend Billy.Because she's thirteen, that's why. I bought you some ice cream.Gee, that's a shame. You always have such pleasant things to say. 'I hate you, Dad.' I'm gonna miss that, darn it... It's chocolate chip, your favorite.That's for saying asshole. God, I hate wasting food. Wanna abuse me some more? Go ahead, shock me. You know, I hardly ever hear the word asshole.All right, knock it off.Hey, you want it, you got it, lady.You're grounded for a week.That's two. You wanna play this game? I love this game.All right, that's it. You wanna be a gutter mouth? You wanna sound like your mother, well that's terrific. Christ, all day long I don't take enough abuse, I gotta listen to shit from you!Don't you tell me how to talk to my kid.Go for it, kiddo. All the dirty words. Come on, shock me. Go ahead.All right, I've had it. Go to your room. Or I will whip your behind.Goddammit, you are my daughter and you will respect me, got that? You got it? You don't ever call me a fuck-up.Your mother called me a fuck-up...? When?Uncle Jay? Ohh, Christ, I'm a fuck-up, but Uncle Jay, now there's a real stand-up guy. Shit, the bastard cheats on his tax form, I'm surprised he hasn't done time! Why don't you ask your mother why Mister Wonderful isn't in jail for tax evasion?No. Anything that much fun, I'd want to do myself.Yeah. That's me.Yeah, I was a regular Boy Scout. Joe starts to fix a sandwich. Jimmy takes nips from the bottle.Don't know. He bites into the sandwich. Not really tasting it.Mike Miller wasn't the first time. Sarah has cheated on me before. Twice. I never told her I knew. At first, my opinion of women took a real dip, yeah.Now I'm content if I like the guy she's fucking. This last one was my best friend.What am I, Jimmy?Friends can't be perfect. I wish the sky wasn't blue. I wish water wasn't wet. I wish I didn't still love my wife. He eats in silence. Jimmy says:What?Damn. You, too?You're wrong.No, life sucks. But you're not a loser. Cory loved you.Because it's easier than paying the tax, Junior.So deep I don't know what the fuck it means.Is Alex your accountant?I'm sorry.He would have been a great ball player. Like his dad.Why did he have to die?Not in my house, you dumb motherfucker.Shut up. He picks up the vial of powder.This is what you went looking for in Cory's apartment, isn't it? You found this when you found that envelope. He crosses to the toilet. Jimmy cries out.You got it, son. I'm just mixing it in with all the other shit. Get the fuck out of my house. Now.I said, get out. I'll break your fucking neck, kiddo. Jimmy glares at him. Coldly defiant.I don't use it. I get by.When you're through feeling sorry for yourself, the front door's that way.You brought cocaine in my house. End of story. Jimmy is silent. He stands. Exits into the hall.I told you to go to your room.Go to bed. This guy's not signing anything.Forget it, Darian. The guy's a loser. Big time. Darian's face is a mask of confusion.Smile, you fuck.Goddammit, Jimmy, I told you -- ! It isn't Jimmy. Standing on the porch is a tall, thin man with blond hair. The man removes a TASER GUN from his overcoat.I'm awake. His eyelids creak open. He squints, adjusting to the light. Studies his captors.Life's a bitch.Anybody got a cigarette...? Chet steps forward. Grins wickedly.I seem to have dropped my cigarette. May I have another? Chet turns, meets his gaze. The grin falters a bit.I need a light. And if you touch me again... I'll kill you. A pregnant pause. The challenge hangs in the air. Slowly, Chet takes the lighter from his pocket. Pablo looks on, a smile twisting his features. Hallenbeck leans forward for a light. Chet extends his arm -- And slugs Hallenbeck in the face again. Rocks him. Chet howls with laughter. Pablo grins.I needed a light. Milo nods as if this makes perfect sense.If you wanted me dead, you'd have already killed me.Fuck it. You're the bad guy, right?And you've got the gun, and I'm supposed to tremble in fear, something like that?Fine. I'll start trembling in a minute. Mind if I have a drink first?Hey, look who's here. Connie Marcon himself. Sure enough, CONRAD MARCON saunters in, just like he owns the place. Which, by the way, he does. Tall, strong, Texas-tough. Dressed in a Saville Row suit. He frowns at Hallenbeck:You got friends? When did this happen?You're pretty calm for a man whose team is three and six on the year.They stink. Marcon's composure falters, but only for a moment.When do I say the Pledge of Allegiance? Marcon looks directly at Hallenbeck.Oh, for Chrissake. You're telling me this whole thing is about TV ratings?I got the rifle in my closet as a souvenir.Gambling.Shit, that's what this is about! You're bribing United States senators. Paying them to pass legislation --Attendance goes up again. TV ratings go up again.Before we get too fucking happy, let's get a couple things straight: first, I'm not your fucking son, and second... why am I still alive? Marcon stops pacing. Sighs and sits down facing Hallenbeck.I don't get it. What's the snag?Thank God. For a minute there I felt hell freezing over. Did he ask for more than a million?Taking off a U.S. senator, that's pretty ballsy. Even for an asshole like you.Who is? Marcon says nothing. Just looks at Hallenbeck and smiles.Oh, shit. He rubs tired eyes.I'm the perfect fall guy. Everyone and his uncle Max knows I hate Baynard.Any particular reason I should go along with this prize-winning scheme?Are you alright, Sarah?Go fuck yourself. Pablo delivers a savage kick to Hallenbeck's ribs. Hallenbeck gasps in pain.I meant that... in a good way... Pablo hauls him to his feet. Props him against the railing.I'm asshole... she's fuckhead. And with that, Pablo lets him have it.Don't... look at me...I get the shit beat out of me... puke all over myself... and now you love me?Christ, you slept with three guys.I knew.Figured... you needed them.Like what? 'Fuck you, Sarah'?Sorry... I'm fresh out.Must be my trick ear. Sounded like you said, 'Get me out of this.'I've got cracked ribs and a concussion.I don't believe in heroes.Fuck you, Sarah... And he smiles.You're gonna kill us both anyway.I'll be back. That's a promise. Milo clubs Joe in the head with his pistol.If you touch me again... I'll kill you. They stare into each other's eyes. Hallenbeck does not give an inch. Milo hits him again.Fuck you, cocksucker.Nope.I'd go off and suck some cock and leave him the fuck alone. Milo studies Hallenbeck the way a museum curator might study a new species of fish.Come again?Play some rap music. Milo chuckles, shakes his head.When do I kill Baynard?I'm not?Jesus. He thinks he's geting his two-million-dollar payoff. Milo nods. Points to two identical suitcases in the corner.Plastics?That sounds lovely, but how is my body gonna get charred? With a flourish, Milo pulls aside a tablecloth. Under the table is a five gallon can of gasoline.surfaces, gasping for air. Trying to swim with his hands tied.What the hell's she doing here??Get below, Darian. And stay there. He stumbles into the wheelhouse. Dazed. Barely conscious.Yeah. Go really fast and hope they don't catch us. Oh, shit.Fog bank, dead ahead. Hang on. Into the fog they go, and, folks -- This is really scary. Because you can't see a foot in front of your face. They plunge through the fog at fifty miles an hour. Hallenbeck sweats, eyes glued to the windshield.We're dead. Except, just then, a strange thing happens: Milo's yacht veers off to the left. Away from Hallenbeck. Jimmy stares, dumbfounded.'Cause they got sonar, that's why! Hard to port!Left, Goddammit. The boat slews to the left, as, from out of the fog --Kill the running lights and radio the Coast Guard. Jimmy flicks off the lights. Grabs the mike. As he does, a VIBRATING RUMBLE fills the cockpit, causing him to pause... and then stare in shock as their boat emerges from the fog -- And Air One hovers directly overhead.Get down! They both hit the floor. Hands over their heads -- And then the pilot makes a costly error: He descends right into the path of Milo's yacht. With no warning whatsoever, the boat comes bursting out of the fog -- PLOWS right INTO the HELICOPTER. Second number one: The boat pierces the chopper, rips it to shreds. Second number two: The whole boat-slash-chopper mix erupts in a shower of wood and fiberglass. Turns night into day.What's that? Jimmy looks: A bright object... going in circles...It can get us to shore faster than this one, don't you think?Hand me the pole. Jimmy hands him a long, wooden pole with a hooked end. He fishes in the water. Snares a large, floating object. Swings it aboard. Drops it at Jimmy's feet. The suitcase.Birthday present.Wait here. He swings aboard the senator's boat. Gun cocked. Ready.Sorry, Cal. Life in the big city. CUT TO: EXT. LONG BEACH BOAT RENTALS - NIGHT The senator's boat pulls up to the dock. No one is around.Listen carefully. I'm gonna go get your mom back, okay? You're gonna go in the Denny's restaurant and stay there. Talk to the waitress but don't mention me. Mom and I will come pick you up later, got it?Are you kidding? I do this for a living. Buy me an ice cream. I'll be back. I love you. She throws her arms around him. CUT TO:Quit being a fuckin' killjoy. He cuts the headlights. Cruises to a stop behind a road- side dumpster.Come on. We've got some things to pick up.Let's get him inside and tie him up.I forgot. Hurry up.Wear that. He strips off his own shirt. Crosses to the closet.You know how to use a gun?Here. He hands Jimmy a shotgun and a box of odd, black cylinders.Use these. They're shredders. Equipped with an explosive charge. When you fire the gun, they spray on impact. Take out anything within ten yards.A little souvenir... He reaches into the closet. Pulls out a sniper rifle. The rifle. The one responsible for the puckered scar on his chest.Go bring the car around.I got a subscription to Jugs magazine.Hey, who's writing this story? You're doing all the good parts.What cop?You son of a bitch...! Pablo is making a big mistake, but he doesn't know it. He is fueling Joe Hallenbeck's rage. Pity the fool. Hallenbeck regards him with dead, lifeless eyes. A thoroughly unnerving stare.We don't like Pablo very much, do we, Furry Tom...? There is a pause... And then, incredibly -- Furry Tom answers. A high-pitched, squeaky stuffed cat voice.No, Mr. Hallenbeck, we think Pablo is a motherless fuck who takes it up the ass. Dead silence. Pablo is completely thrown; so are we, for that matter... and then it hits us: Joe is doing ven- triloquism.Furry Tom, tell Pablo what I'm gonna do to him.You're gong to make Pablo eat all his teeth, Mr. Hallenbeck.Hey, Mr. Hallenbeck, they're laughin' at me. That's not very nice. By now, all three hoods are in hysterics.Are you mad, Furry Tom?I don't get mad. I get even. And, with that, Furry Tom's mouth opens -- And EXPLODES, showering stuffing. One of the goons is still laughing when he realizes half his throat is gone... And Furry Thomas BELCHES FIRE again, and the second goon goes down in a spray of blood, and if you haven't guessed already -- Joe has a gun hidden inside Furry Thomas. Pablo is a little sharper. A little quicker. He dives forward, knocks the puppet from Joe's hand. Joe drives upward, into Pablo's gut. They reel across the room. Locked in combat. Lamps topple. GLASS BREAKS. Pablo slams Joe's head into the wall. Leaves a dent. Does it again, a sickening impact... Starts to strangle Joe -- And the truth is, Joe's not thirty anymore. He's not going to make it. The world swims away. Then, as if through a tunnel, Joe notices something beside him... something hanging on the wall. Fights to focus. Breath gone. Strength gone. Identifies the object:Don't. He jams the rifle barrel into Marcon's throat, nearly crushing his larynx. Hisses:The gun is silenced, I'll fuckin' kill you. Where's my wife?My wife. Grabs a pen. Shoves it in Marcon's hand.The address. Now!Write it down, dumbfuck.Jimmy, you okay...? Jimmy stirs.Okay, Connie, you're gonna walk us out of here, nice and easy, got it? Can you walk, Jimmy?You drop it, asshole, or I kill Marcon.Well, Goddamn. How's the head, Lou?Next time, Lou, just say no.Speaking of which, what the fuck are you doing here?In other words, you dropped your father's name a bunch of times.Do I also have you to thank for dragging me into this mess?He should know, Jimmy. With a face like that, he's gotta be paying for it.Gimmee a minute.You know of course, Connie, that you're a dead man. Marcon holds up his hand.Nothing much, just that I made a phone call from the boat on the way in.Oh, but I didn't call the cops. I called the mob. Marcon stares at him. Blinks.See, Connie, every year, the mob rakes in two and a half billion from football bookmaking. If you succeed in making gambling legal, all that money goes to the government. I wouldn't be surprised if they put out a contract on you. Of course, I might be able to call it off. Marcon stares him down. A pause. Then Marcon smiles:Then there's the matter of two million dollars. Or didn't you know that watertight suitcases float...? He once again looks Marcon in the eye.I've got your money, Connie. Stashed in the back of a rented Subaru. We'll take you to it.Hell, I'm fresh out. You wanna try one, kid, go for it. A pause. Then, without warning, Jimmy turns -- And slugs Hallenbeck with his good arm. Decks him.Plastic keys...? The kind that melt?You did fine, junior.Forget about him. Let's get my wife. He crosses to a parked Mercedes. SHOOTS open the door. Gets in. Pops the ignition package. Hotwires it. The CAR ROARS to life.Get in. He's so slick, it's scary.On my way, honey, on my way...We get in, we get out. Shoot anyone who's not my wife. Check that: Don't shoot me. He jacks a fresh clip into his rifle. CUT TO:Cut. He throws the hunting knife. It pierces the guy's neck. The chainsaw clatters to the floor. He does the funny little dance peculiar to those with pierced necks. Falls. Dies. And then, mercifully, it's over. Joe crosses to the bed, puts out an arm, and Sarah collapses against him, shaking with sobs.I'm here... it's all right... I'm here... He cradles his wife in the middle of a slaughterhouse. CUT TO: EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT Sarah is now dressed, as Joe supports her across the sidewalk toward the stolen Mercedes. He turns to Jimmy. Hands him a set of keys.Drive one of their cars. They won't be needing them.The two million bucks is still in the Subaru. Parked on Mulholland above Marcon's house. Go pick it up and bring it to the office. We're gonna go get Darian.I'll take you and Darian to the office. You can sleep there.There's four corpses in the bedroom.Jimmy should be here any minute. Then we gotta talk to the cops. Sarah nestles into the crook of his arm.Maybe. He's probably in some secret crash pad, packing to leave town. A pause, then Sarah says:Don't knock it. It's a skill. She turns. Looks into his eyes.Ahh, shit. Looks like the local constable has come to chat.No. Stay here. I'll deal with it.That's not L.A.P.D....Son of a bitch! He dives for cover, the turf erupting all around him, as:huddles behind the billboard as the bullets stitch upward. Through the wooden frame. A hot SLUG RIPS through Joe's arm. An eruption of blood. He hisses in pain. Rolls away from the gunfire. Looks around. Desperate. Sees a painter's bucket lying nearby. He counts to three.watches in dismay as Milo climbs onto the platform... Walks across the front of the billboard. Toward the freeway. Toward Joe. Snarling. Joe grabs a broken bottle off the ground. Heaves it. Milo puts up an arm, catches a glancing blow. Blood flows. All it does is piss him off.She's something, isn't she? Milo pitches forward. Falls to his death.stares, dumbfounded at Sarah. She look up at him. A moment passes between them. Around Hallenbeck, a sea of crumpled cars. HORNS BLARING. Amidst it all, he stands. Beaten. Bloody. Bullet-scarred. Jimmy winds his way through the cars. Walks up to Joe. They stand in silence for a moment, then Jimmy says:I know.I know.My wife loves me. Bessalo looks at him like he's grown a tail.Yeah. So.Some of it.My fee. He shuts the case. Shoves it toward Jimmy. Jimmy leans forward, eyeing the suitcase.I'm thinkin' I could use a partner. Think you could handle that for awhile?See, Jim, the thing is, life sucks. But you still can't be hangin' around Satan Claus, you know why...?'Cause someday, compadre... Satan Claus and Santa Claus are gonna have a big fight, and you know what...? Santa's gonna kick some royal ass. He puts a fatherly arm around Jimmy's shoulder, grins:Hey.

so damn ugly. He gets up and goes into the head. Pulls out a glass vial. Dips a coke spoon with practiced ease. Sucks it up a nostril. For one moment, he catches his own eye in the mirror. FLASH CUT TO:I don't know. He looks up at his reflection. Glazed eyes, beard stubble. Crows' feet around the eyes.Yeah. I guess I am. He sniffs, clearing his nose.'Morning, boys. They all grunt. One of them, name of HENRY, looks up at him. Holds out a half-smoked doobie:No, man. Why do you think they call it dope? Henry, did I do anything last night that I should know about?No, man, I meant something bad, that I should know about.Soon, Henry. One of the other PLAYERS looks up, says:'86 and '87, that was me.Thanks. What the hell, shit floats. I'll be back.I'll be back. Everyone plays cards. No one looks at him. He frowns. Leaves.Ho. Ray. The MAN looks up, annoyed.What's with the girl? She surfaces, sputtering and screaming. Ray thrusts her beneath the surface again.Too early in the morning, Ray. Let her go.Ray. Let her go.Ray, she's gonna drown.Last chance, Ray.Fine. Jimmy turns, as if to walk away. Instead, he spins back and launches the football. It sings, that's how hard he throws it. And when it smacks Ray in the face, something breaks. It ain't the ball. The big man howls. Clutching his flattened nose. The girl comes up for air. Gagging and choking. Jimmy is at her side instantly. Pulls her out of the water.Get out of here. Go. She goes. He leans over and grabs Ray by the hair. The guy is bleeding. Delirious. Jimmy yanks until their faces are inches apart.Best arm in the National League, you son of a bitch. Remember that. He lets go. Ray sags, semi-conscious. The poker players come running as Jimmy walks back inside.Alex the astronaut. Harp raises his own glass.I've had it, Harp.It, man. I've had it. I don't remember what I did last night. I'm an idiot, Harp, I act like a complete dickhead. I don't have friends. I drink too much. I fuck anything that's warm and breathing.I cheated on my girl friend again.Maybe so, Harp. Maybe so. His gaze wanders across the crowded room, fixating on --How much for a bottle?No thanks. Nothing personal, my seventh grade teacher was killed by a drunk driver.That's the one.Ha-ha.For forty bucks I'd rather drink my own piss.Hi, Cory. Rough night?I'll bet you have. She slaps his face. He feigns innocence. Points to Hallenbeck.Who's the stiff?Come back soon. I want to buy you a drink. She smiles and moves off, swishingly. Jimmy watches her go. His gaze wanders across the room to Hallenbeck. He frowns.Hi. You're nobody.That's what Cory said. She said you were nobody. Only Hallenbeck's eyes move. He looks up, regards Jimmy coolly. They size each other up. Hallenbeck sighs.I see. What are you, some kind of bodyguard?No. Is Cory in trouble?She didn't mention anything to me.Maybe.She hired you, huh? What, you in the phonebook?Where's Mike?Sorry to hear it.Look, friend, I don't know who you are or what's going on. But Cory is my girl friend and if she's in trouble, I want to hear about it.Tell me anyway.I say two words to Cory and you don't get paid, asshole.You sure? I'm looking at your suit, you could use the dough.Good, 'cause you're not getting any.What is?You couldn't protect a cup of warm piss.Excuse me?You know who I am?Mister... You are now pissing me off.I don't know, Joe... You look like a dumb wop to me.Can I hit you now?You think you're some kind of hot shit tough guy, huh?Piss off.Yeah. Thanks. I guess.Alex the pediatrician.Sure.Oh God. This is a hit this is a fucking hit!!frantically floors the pedal of his Jag, pops the clutch -- And stalls out. He roars with anger. Flings open the door. Leaps out and runs forward, screaming:Cory, get out of there!! Too late. Cory is already out of her car, yelling:Oh Gooood!! And without missing a beat, the Hitmen turn -- And OPEN FIRE on Jimmy. He takes a running start. Clears the hood of his Jag in a single leap. BULLETS DICE the metal behind him.is still huddled on the front seat in a sea of broken glass. Hallenbeck walks up, leans in the window.That stuff Cory fed you about a weirdo hassling her. That was all bullshit, wasn't it...?None of your fucking business.I don't know. Pretty strapped, I guess.No hooking, if that's what you mean.The usual. Waitressing. Get a guy to buy you a bottle of champagne. Sit in a private booth, let the poor fuck spill his troubles. Used to say she'd make a great psychiatrist.Sure. Even rich guys get lonely.I don't get it.Jesus, I've had about enough of you --She'd consider it. If she could get away with it. But she'd need hard evidence. Otherwise, it's 'I never said that,' his word against hers.I don't know. Follow the guy? Have him followed?Who does she hire?Except you told me that Mike was a shitty surveillance man.Christ, what did the two of them stumble onto?How you figure?He handed it to you... without telling you how dangerous it was? Hallenbeck stares straight ahead. Sighs and says:Shit. This shirt cost me eighty bucks.Do me a favor and shut up. You think I don't care that Cory's dead? Christ, I feel like I been rode hard and put away wet.Wow. What stunning advice. I was gonna go hiking.You know something, Joe, for a private eye, you sure don't go in for snappy comebacks.Get some sleep. A passing PATROLMAN stops. Eyes Jimmy thoughtfully. Frowns:You might. Some people recognize me.No, man. I played football. Jimmy Dix, L.A. Stallions.Forget it.Fuck you.That son of a bitch! He's ready to clean the pimp's clock when Hallenbeck grabs him, spins him bodily. Propels him out the front doors. Away from trouble.He hit the chick.Guy shouldn't treat a woman like that, is all I'm saying. He just shouldn't, okay?Yeah. He's serious. Hallenbeck starts to chuckle. Shakes his head, lights a cigarette. Laughs through the smoke. This may be the funniest thing he's ever heard. CUT TO:Mind if I catch a ride with you?My car's fucked up, remember?Cut it out. Look, you sorta saved my life. Let me buy you a beer.That's it. Good night?What are you gonna do?What's the message?You're kidding. Joe gets in the car. Says nothing.You're backing off, you're not gonna do anything? I watch T.V., what the fuck kind of private eye doesn't do anything?Fuck you your job is done. We witnessed a murder, Joe!Look, until this is over, I'm sticking with you.I'm part of this. We do something, we do it together.Don't drive away, Joe. Joe puts it in gear. Pulls away.Joe -- ! I'll tell the cops, Joe. Joe taps the brake. Stops. Leans out the window, says softly:That Mike Miller was fucking your wife. Only reason you're not in the cooler, tough guy, is the cops got no motive for Miller's death. When they find out Mikey was dickin' your old lady, seems to me you become suspect numero uno. I'm scared, and I'm coming with you, got it? Joe gets out of the car and advances on Jimmy.Go for it. Then the cops'll really love my story. You don't start a fight in a police station, dickhead.Gosh, you're tough.You got any hobbies?Ventriloquist, really? I hear Ps and Bs are the hardest.Hey, you got any tapes in here? Man, what is this shit? Dick Haymes. Who the fuck is Dick Haymes? Jeez, you must be older than I thought. Hallenbeck grimaces and shifts in his seat.What's the matter? Stomach problems?What kind of ear problems?Baynard, huh? What's the matter, you got some kind of beef with the guy?You wanna share with the class?Yeah? What were you, cop or something?You're high. Get outta here. Really...? You protected the man? Holy shit, you musta got laid every night.She had an apartment on the West Side. Why?I thought you were off the case.Whoa, back up. You mean, we're gonna nail these fuckers after all...? Damn. I knew there was a hero lurking beneath that gruff exterior.Tell me about it. I'm paying the fucking rent.Wasn't like that. Cory could've had lots of rich guys. Me, she loved.Let me guess. You don't believe in love.What, they're both diseases?Man, I don't want to meet the bitch that fucked you up.Little bitter, Joe?Yes, massah.I think someone disturbed some stuff, Joe.Beat us to what?Assuming there was any. Stay here a minute.Bathroom. You wanna come with me? Doctor said I shouldn't lift anything heavy.Find anything?I may have something.Later. Let's get out of here.As long as we're here, I might as well take Cory's car.Yeah. I'll follow you. Hallenbeck starts to turn away. Jimmy gets in the car. Hallenbeck stops. Frowns.Yeah. This one's just sitting here until she can sell it. The color drains from Hallenbeck's features.Ouch -- ! What's your problem?Oh. Shit. Oh. Jeez. Hallenbeck claps him on the back.What are you doing? Hallenbeck brandishes a pair of wire-cutters.Whoa. Hold on. Um, shouldn't we call the bomb squad or something?No, man, I --You're a fucking asshole!Great. So what now?Give up? Flee? Go really far away?Sure. Family, huh? You got kids?Does she like you?I like Prince.You're just gonna stick that in your trunk?Is it the cops?The streetlights are on.Tell him it's not for sale.Leave him alone, you fuck!Christ... I'm being beat up by the inventor of Scrabble.And then you'll let us go, right?Jesus fucking Christ!Don't know yet. They crawl to their feet, inspecting for broken bones.The dynamite?Dead guys... don't make bad jokes, right?So we're alive.What?If you thought there was dynamite in the trunk, wait'll you see this. Hallenbeck reaches into the envelope and extracts a photograph: Two men having lunch together on a secluded patio. Both are older, distinguished-looking. Joe suddenly looks very pale.The guy on the left is Connie Marcon, the owner of the L.A. Stallions.Sort of familiar. Who is he?Let's go back to the cops. I'm scared.Not so bad. Excuse me, did you just say the words not so bad? You don't understand, Joe, see, if a guy vomits on the sidewalk, you don't say, 'Oh, hey, it's not so bad, there's some ham in there.' It's fucking vomit, okay? This is bad. Hallenbeck nervously lights a cigarette. Stares straight ahead through the windshield. Begins to talk:The senator fucked your job.Cory tumbled to some sort of deal between Marcon and the senator, and they had her killed. We gotta show this photo to the cops.Why should I help you?So I get to meet your family, huh? What's your daughter like?Why couldn't she go?Hey, Joe, take it easy...You know, for fifty bucks you could get a guy to pull out her fingernails with a pair of pliers.I think we could both use a drink. Hallenbeck crosses to a cabinet, breaks out a bottle of Seagrams. Swigs. Hands it to Jimmy. As Jimmy drinks, he notices a photo on the wall: Hallenbeck shaking hands with George Bush.That's you?You look like the dad on 'The Brady Bunch.'So. You gonna get a divorce?You don't like women much, do you, Joe?And now?Horseshit, he was a scumbag private eye.He tried to get you killed.You know what I did last night?I went to a party and shit on a car.I'm a complete loser. Capital 'L.' All I ever wanted... was to be somebody's hero, you know it...? Now I mostly sit around. Watch T.V. Get laid. I'm a fucking slug, throw salt on me I'd curl up. Life sucks.Life doesn't suck?Yeah, and the last thing I did was cheat on her. Why do people cheat, Joe?Ooooooh. Very deep.It means another drink is required. He raises the bottle.Alex the accountant. He drinks. Hallenbeck frowns, watching him.No. But he could have been. Alex was my son. Hallenbeck stares at him.I was married at 19. Sweet young thing, looking to get out from under daddy's thumb. I didn't know she was a junkie. All during her pregnancy. Shooting up. There were complications. She died. Alex lived for seventeen minutes in the incubator. Fell asleep. Died before he woke up. He was born... He had time for one dream... and then he died. I wonder what his dream was about.I think about him a lot. I mean, who was this... guy?This little guy who only got seventeen minutes, who was he, Joe...? What was he like? What would he have been?No. He had to die, Joe. Don't you see?Because he came out of me. He puts aside the bottle. Scowls.I'm gonna borrow your shower. He exits. Hallenbeck watches him go. Says nothing.Joe, man, you don't get it --Joe, please! Joe drops the vial in the water. Flushes. Jimmy darts forward. Joe shoves him back.You stupid bastard, do you know what you've done? That was a thousand bucks' worth of shit!You don't understand.Go ahead, tough guy. Go ahead. I'm trying to survive, man. I use that stuff to get by, so fuck you.Oh, sure, Dudley fucking Do-Right, you stand there and judge me, and, meanwhile, you never had your old lady die on you, did you, pal?? And your fucking kid?? And I said to God, 'Hey, buddy, what gives? I go to church, I give to the United Way, what is this dead wife and kid shit...?' And he didn't say nothin', Joe. He grabs a towel. Scrubs savagely at his wet torso.And then I lose my job, my fucking life, okay, and why...? You know why? Because I gambled. Whoa, hold on, stop the presses, Jimmy gambled, well shit, of course I gambled, everybody does, and the fucking league knows it! He advances on Joe, trembling with anger.Why, Joe? Why is there an injury report in pro football, huh...? Nobody else has a fucking injury report, but the N.F.L. does, so the fucking gamblers will know the spread! Marcon... the commissioner ... those fucking hypocrites... killed the last thing I could do, Joe...! I can't do anything... anymore.I couldn't save my wife... She died screaming and I couldn't do a Goddamn thing... And my baby came out... and he was so fuckin' small, Joe... He was too fuckin' small... He collapses against the wall. Slides down to a sitting position. Huddled on the floor. Hallenbeck watches him. Says nothing. For a moment, he seems moved to compassion... Then his gaze hardens. He kneels next to Jimmy.You're a total bastard.Huh? There is an awkward pause. Darian holds out a football card. Young, smiling Jimmy. The card is old. Tattered.I never shaved points, Joe. I never did. Joe is silent. Stone-faced.If you want my help, I'm at the Casa Loma Apartments on Ventura. He exits. Shuts the door behind him. Darian goes into her room, fuming. Shuts the door.Who are you, and how the fuck do you know my name?I'm growing whiskers here, guys. You got something to say, fucking say it.Who?Please, guys, don't do this... Jesus Christ, I was just her boyfriend, I swear to God, please! They toss Jimmy over the fence.Oh, God, my arm, my fucking arm, oh Jesus Christ!!! He kneels in the muddy water, rocking back and forth.Look, I'll say it again for the cheap seats: I don't know anything and I can't help you. Okay? Can I go now?That's it.How the fuck should I know? Try his house.For Chrissake, I just met the guy. Look, Sergeant. I don't give a shit about Joe Hallenbeck. I just busted my throwing arm and I'm in a real pissy mood, so you got two choices: either charge me with something or let me the fuck outta here. He glares defiantly at Bessalo. CUT TO:Hey. Wake up.I need to borrow a gun, Henry.I'm gonna crash a party out on Catalina. Marcon will be there. He swings a bag of gear onto the boat. Starts to store it.No, honey. Not now. There's some big shots involved in this mess, and it's my word against theirs. If I blab to the cops, your mom and dad will disappear and they'll never find the bodies. I'm sorry, Darian.What I do... is confront Conrad Marcon and threaten to go to the cops, unless he gives them back.Beats me, but I think it's what your dad would do.Me, too, honey. His gear stashed, he turns to Darian. Tries a smile.So... why'd you come to me, anyhow?What?I'll get them back, kiddo. I'll get them back. CUT TO:Okay, hot shit, let's do it.Goddammit, I told you to go home!Fine, whatever. Just stay here. With the boat.Anything funny happens, get the fuck out of here. Darian takes the keys. Frowns, says:I feel terrible.I was. I kicked the habit.This morning. Stay here. He swings over the side, onto the dock.Thanks, kid. You're a fuckin' inspiration.Gimmee the keys, kiddo.The Senator's here, and he's leaving by the back door. I'm gonna follow him. He keys the ignition.Get off the boat.Darian, Goddammit --Okay. Shit. Okay. Easy. Shit. He throttles forward. The Hatteras pulls away from the dock. CUT TO:Goddammit, I lost him. I can't see a fucking thing.Oh, yeah, little Miss Know-It-All.Watch your mouth.All we're doing is burning gas. Sorry, kid, I'm turning back. The words are barely out of his mouth when he hears a throbbing NOISE, growing louder... Darian looks up puzzled.Holy fucking shit! Rotor wash sprays in every direction. The noise is deafening.Oh, wow. We're fucked. He GUNS the ENGINE. Spins the wheel, banks to port.Shit. I don't believe it.Keep the wheel like this! Don't let it move! She grabs the wheel. Jimmy bends down. Opens a compart- ment. Takes out the boat's anchor. Metal hook, attached to seventy yards of chain. He hefts it like a grappling hook.Third and long, baby, lets' go...Got any ideas?What?What the fuck? They're peeling off. Why? A pause... then it hits Joe like a thunderbolt:Port?Shit fuck piss! They almost make it. As it is, they avoid a head-on. Instead, they hit broadside. A sickening CRUNCH -- ! Jimmy and Joe are thrown from their feet. A momentary glimpse of faces rushing past -- Horrified tourists -- And then the ferry is behind them. Jimmy gets up. Staggers to the controls. Pushes the throttle. The boat lurches forward -- Then SPUTTERS. Fizzles. He swears violently.We're on half power, we lost an engine!swears again. Bangs his fist.We're sitting ducks. They got sonar. They can find us.Fuck me. The two men watch, helpless, as the helicopter descends, the Co-Pilot taking aim with a LAWS rocket.That's Baynard's boat!What is it?Holy fucking shit!!Your prints are all over that boat. What happens when they find the bodies inside?Oh, I forgot to tell you. The police want you for killing Mike Miller. Hallenbeck shoots him a withering look. CUT TO:Are you crazy? That's a cop! You don't punch cops!The trigger's the little black thing.What are you gonna use?Nobody knows. Just... just me... and Hallenbeck...Nobody... Marcon raises the poker. Brings it down on Jimmy's broken arm.Hurts like hell. Marcon finishes writing. Hallenbeck snatches up the address. Stows it in his pocket.Yeah... I think so -- Joe, behind you...! Too late. A revolver is cocked a foot from Joe's head.Shit. This is the drunk guy you slugged, look what you did to his face! Marcon, meanwhile, is positively livid. He snaps at Baynard:She wasn't a hooker, dickhead.We'd rather watch yours. It's goofy-lookin'. Marcon has had enough. He pounds his fist on the desk.Any bright ideas, Joe?Excuse me, could you give him a minute? He's trying to think of a way out of this.I don't think it's working, Joe. Try another one.Fuck you, Joe, I'm not just gonna stand here and die. Mr. Marcon, he's lying. We do have the money, but it's not in a car, it's in a storage locker. I have the key on me. I'l hand it over if you let me go. Hallenbeck stares in disbelief. The kid's actually trying something.It's stashed in my shorts.Sure. Slow and easy. Jimmy reaches inside his jeans. Slowly, cautiously pulls something out, concealed in his fist. We see, but Marcon doesn't: It's a shredder shell. He holds it in his fist.Promise you'll let me go.Oh, yeah? Well, that's too bad. See, it's one of those new plastic keys. The kind that melt...? And, with that, he hurls it into the fire. So fast that nobody can see just what he threw.I guess nobody gets the money. The two hardguys rush to the fireplace.Hey. Short notice, best I could do.Learned it from a pro. Come on.Son of a bitch!I'm new at this, Joe. How do we do it?Where do you want me to go?Yes, massah. He moves off into the parking lot. Hallenbeck says to Sarah.I don't fucking believe it. He swerves over to the side and meanwhileThe car's over on the other side. C'mere, I want to show you something.Somebody broke in and swiped the suitcase from the back seat. Had to be Marcon, right? There is a pause. They both stare at the car. Two million. Down the drain. Except, after a beat... they begin to laugh. First chuckling, then chortling.. Now it's go-for-broke. Jimmy hoots. Joe howls. Jimmy pulls out a key and opens the trunk -- You can guess what's inside.Son of a bitch got the wrong one! CUT TO:So.You gonna keep it? Hallenbeck nods.How much? Hallenbeck frowns. Opens the case. Reaches in -- And plucks out two crisp $100 bills. Stuffs them in a pocket. Jimmy stares at him.Shit, Joe... I got all the money I need. He shoves it back into the center. Joe nods.I maybe could handle that. For awhile. He pours a drink.

holiday pictures. That was hers. Her teacher wants to see us, Joe.It's hideous.I'm tense. I couldn't get to sleep last night.Are you kidding? Brace Face, that's the latest. Little bastards.Watch your Goddamn mouth, Joe.You're not funny. All the girls at that school wear makeup.Go live with them.Excuse me?Well, nothing changes. You're still a lunatic.Please leave. I have to get dressed.You want me to open the closet, Joe? Huh? You want me to indulge your fucking paranoia, I'll throw the door open, is that what you want me to do...?I'll do it, Joe. Okay? And then we'll both know you're a psycho, is that what you want? Huh?? An awkward pause. Finally Hallenbeck scowls and says:Thank you.If you shoot up my house, Joe, I will make you eat that gun.Call your shrink, Joe. I still have the number. Call him and tell him you're losing it, I cannot fucking deal with you like this -- !Joe, dammit -- ! He sighs. Starts to pull the trigger. And Sarah screams --Jesus, no -- ! And grabs the gun. Everything freezes. She looks at him. He looks at her. Understanding occurs.Put the gun down.She stayed at Cindy's last night. He nods. Turns and waves the gun at Miller.Do what he says, Joe. Joe sits. Breathing shallowly. Eyes locked on Milo.Yes.Goddamn you, stop it!! Oh, Jesus, leave him alone!Shhh. It's okay, Joe. I'm here, it's okay. I love you, Joe.I never stopped loving you, Joe.You knew about the others?You never said anything.Joe, Goddammit, why didn't you say something?Yes. Fuck you, Sarah! Anything to show that you... that you had some pride left. A pause. Then Hallenbeck heaves a sigh.I'm scared, Joe. Get me out of this.You can take these guys, Joe.Save me, Joe. Be a hero.That's no excuse. He stares up at her for a moment. Then, through bloody lips:Joe...!on a bed, naked. bright lights on her. Around her, a director. A cameraman.Why can't we go home?Oh. It's a very tiny \"oh.\" ESTABLISHING SHOT - JOE'S OFFICE in the shadow of the freeway. The night wears on. From the billboard, Gorgeous continues to entice.Will the police catch Marcon?I remember when we got married... My friends would talk about their husbands. They'd say, 'Oh, my husband is a big-time publisher,' or, 'My husband is a brilliant lawyer...' I used to say, 'My husband can stand over a shotgun victim and eat a ham sandwich without puking.'I want to try, Joe. Do you still want to try? A pause. He leans in and kisses her tenderly. And, with typically swell timing, a set of headlights rakes across the window, accompanied by the strobing light of a police flasher.Shall we invite him in?You just fucking die.", "clean_line": "sleep lose lose darian class drew holiday pictures teacher wants joe hideous tense couldn sleep night kidding brace face latest little bastards watch goddamn mouth joe funny girls school wear makeup live excuse changes lunatic leave dressed want open closet joe huh want indulge fucking paranoia ll throw door open want ll joe okay ll know psycho want huh awkward pause finally hallenbeck scowls says thank shoot house joe eat gun shrink joe number tell losing fucking deal like joe dammit sighs starts pull trigger sarah screams jesus grabs gun freezes looks looks understanding occurs gun stayed cindy night nods turns waves gun miller says joe joe sits breathing shallowly eyes locked milo yes goddamn stop oh jesus leave shhh okay joe okay love joe stopped loving joe knew said joe goddammit yes fuck sarah pride left pause hallenbeck heaves sigh scared joe guys joe save joe hero excuse stares moment bloody lips joe bed naked bright lights director cameraman home oh tiny oh establishing shot joe office shadow freeway night wears billboard gorgeous continues entice police catch marcon remember got married friends talk husbands oh husband big time publisher husband brilliant lawyer husband stand shotgun victim eat ham sandwich puking want try joe want try pause leans kisses tenderly typically swell timing set headlights rakes window accompanied strobing light police flasher shall invite fucking die"}, "MILO": {"raw_line": "Of course you do, but we're running behind, dearest.Fine. It's done. Right after this next shot. A strident BEEPER GOES OFF on Milo's belt. He turns to the two-man crew and claps his hands for attention.Okay, let's do it. Roll camera.And... action! The closet door opens. A hulking man emerges. He is carrying a chainsaw. The Girl on the bed stares, incredulous.Not at all, dearest. It's what's known as a snuff film. The hulking man pulls the starter cord. The SAW ROARS to life.Easy, Pablo. She's not a piece of meat. He exits. Closes a sound-proofed door behind him.Yes, Mr. Marcon? How can I help you?One hundred percent, sir. I wouldn't have used your name otherwise.Who is he working for?Yes, sir. And then?Good morning, Joseph. He FIRES point-blank. The electrode hits Hallenbeck in the chest. A CRACKLE of electric current. Hallenbeck jerks spastically. The world spirals away. He plunges down into darkness. CUT TO:Is there a problem?Oh, my. Oh, Goddamn. Joseph, Joseph, you don't disappoint me. He draws a Walther PPK and approaches Hallenbeck. Smiling and cheerful.You seem to have killed one of my men.You took an awful risk. Pablo here could have shot you dead.Yes, that's true. I suppose introductions are in order.Yes. I'm the bad guy.Something like that.I don't see why not. Pablo, please take Chet's corpse into the other room, and then fix Mr. Hallenbeck a drink. Suddenly a voice rings out from the doorway:We took the liberty of researching your background.That's a temporary condition, Joseph. As you may be aware, there are distributors in Mexico who positively crave snuff films. And unless you do every fucking thing Mr. Marcon tells you... your wife will make her motion picture debut. He meets Joe's murderous gaze... and smiles.Easy, Pablo. I want him conscious. Pablo is kicking Joe's prone form.Careful, Pablo. We don't want to get Mrs. Hallenbeck all excited in front of hubby. He squats next to Joe.Hello, Joseph, guess what? Time to go, and remember: you follow orders, or the missus pays the price.Perhaps. But there are ways to die, and then there are... ways to die. Capisce? You determine your wife's fate. He yanks Hallenbeck to his feet. Propels him toward the boat. As her husband is being led away, Sarah calls out:You're wasting my time, Joseph. Let's go. Hallenbeck turns. Dirty. Tired. Unshaven. Bloody. He looks at Milo... and grins:It's Milo, sir. We're now underway and should be lying off Catalina within two hours.Very good, sir.No, we're getting along famously.I assure you, neither he nor the senator will see another sunrise.If it annoys you, I could always adopt a Texas drawl, though I'm afraid I don't know any stories about fucking pigs. Sir.I'll remember that, sir. He hangs up. Marcon replaces the receiver and chuckles.Your wife's very pretty.My, my. Little testy this evening. He pulls a switchblade out of his Windbreaker.That's not very polite, you know, calling someone a cocksucker. A lot of hard Ks. Very abusive sounding. Hallenbeck says nothing.What would you do, Joseph, if someone called you that? Would you cut out one of his eyes...?What would you do?It occurs to me, Joseph, that I would very much like to hear you scream.You're so cool, aren't you? So... if you'll pardon the expression... hard-boiled. I'd like, just once, to hear you scream in pain.Fascinating.Come now, Joseph, did you really think that I'd hand you a loaded gun? You're not really going to kill anyone.No. He leans forward.You're going to be framed for the senator's murder... when they find your corpse at the scene of the crime.At eight-fifteen, Senator Baynard will leave the party, hopefully unobserved. He and his entourage will board a fast boat, and rendezvous with us at sea.Baynard will not leave his boat. One of his men will board us, and inspect the contents of the suitcase. This suitcast. He opens one of the cases. Hallenbeck stares.Then we pull a simple switch. When the man returns to his boat, he's carrying this suitcase. He points to the identical twin.Detonation upon opening. Enough to kill the passengers, not enough to sink the craft. And when we place your charred corpse amidst the wreckage, the police will draw the inevitable conclusion: a down-on-his-luck P.I. makes a suicide strike against the man who cost a career.Maybe I'll get to hear you scream, after all... Just then, one of Milo's crew sticks his head in the door.I'm sorry, sir. This boat is Island Security, we're under strict orders to stay within this sector.I'm sorry, we can't help you.Excuse me. Sir? The Fisherman turns. His family beside him.Fuck you, sir.Problem solved. Get over there and put the bodies below where they can't be seen. He saunters away as if nothing unusual has occurred.Roger, Air One, over and out. Up anchor, gentlemen, we have a go. Gag him and stash him. As Milo goes topside, one of the men tapes Joe's mouth. The other opens a cramped storage compartment. They stuff him inside. Shut and lock the door.Hey! Any of you stupid fucks bother to frisk this goombah?Exactly, you didn't think! Goddammit, that's two million bucks there, now frisk the fuckin' guy!Fuck easy. Against the wall, spread 'em!We're cool, baby. He hands over the suitcase.Hard to starboard, get us out of here. Back off a hundred yards and wait for the blast.Air One, Air One, where the fuck is he?Who the fuck is he? A crewman grabs a pair of binoculars. Meanwhile --Air One, Air One, follow the Senator, roger? I'll take the sport boat, you take Baynard, over.Okay, let's go. Full throttle.is draped over a piece of wooden wreckage. Half his hair is burned away. His face is blistered. He looks up, pleading, at the Ensign, as:advances. changing clips. Methodical. Precise. Like a robot. He is obsessed. All vestige of sanity gone.You fucked up my face, Joseph! Joe starts to climb. Scales the wooden structure. Swings himself onto the raised platform. Flattens behind the billboard.Don't try to hide, Joseph. I've got all night, you fucked up my face.

You're pretty calm for a man in your position.They're having some problems.I'm glad you're here, Joe. We got a few things to discuss.For starters, I'm sure you're aware that professional football is changing, and not for better. Used to be, you went to the local stadium come Sunday, you saw heroes. Guys who fought for their hometown. Anymore, no one gives a shit. Ever since Sonny Werblin paid $400,000 to Joe Namath back in '66, the sons of bitches just got greedier. Playing only for themselves. Giving nothing back to the game. Pablo hands him a double bourbon.This year, the final blow: the N.F.L. votes to decertify the Players Organization. Eliminates the draft, reduces all athletes to free agents. Reduces football, once and for all, to commerce. To greed, you follow?Do you know how many ratings points Monday Night Football lost this year? Per week? An average of two point eight.People have stopped watching, Joe! Everybody's turning the channel, they're still looking for heroes, you follow? Guys like you. Milo here tells me you took a bullet for the President, jumped in front of a sniper rifle. Hallenbeck reacts, startled. Looks at Milo.How about it, Joe? Is it truth or hype?There you go, that's what I'm saying. The public wants real heroes. Not a bunch of football prima donnas, jumping from team to team with their fancy lawyers. In fact, Joe, and this is my point, there's only one reason left nowadays to watch pro- football. Can you guess? It begins to dawn on Hallenbeck.Exactly. Gambling. Just one problem: football gambling is illegal in all but two of the fifty states. And that, Joe boy, is where I come in.-- Legalizing football gambling in all fifty states. Exactly.You got it, son. The networks are happy. I'm happy. Everybody's happy.It's like this, Joe: everything was going great until a couple weeks ago, and then I hit a snag: Senator Calvin Baynard.I offered him the bribe and he wouldn't take it. Hallenbeck actually does a spit-take. Sprays bourbon.Allow me to clarify: I offered him the bribe, and he turned it down because he wanted more money.Does the Pope shit in the woods? He wants two million or he'll blow the lid off my whole plan. I don't feel like paying no two mil, so basically that good ole' boy's gotta die.Oh, I'm not going to kill Baynard, Joe.Anything goes wrong, all the heat lands on you, Joe boy. My hands are clean. Hallenbeck scowls.Just one. He motions to Milo, who disappears through a doorway. Reappears a moment later. He's got Joe's wife.Sit down, Joe. A moment. Joe stands, smouldering. On fire. Sarah speaks:Marcon. INTERCUT:Good boy, Milo. The commissioner's party starts at six. I'll put in a token appearance around six-thirty.Any problems with Hallenbeck?Glad to hear it. No fuckups, Milo. I want him deep-sixed.Christ, Milo, how come you always have to talk like a fruit?Cows, Milo. Never pigs.Goddamn fruitcake. He turns, and suddenly we realize he's not alone in the room: a STRANGE MAN is seated in the shadows off to one side. His face is obscured... Marcon addresses him:So far, so good. The Man in the corner nods, then speaks. As he does, we notice he has a speech impediment; it sounds like he's talking with his mouth full.Take it easy, buddy. We're covered.Absolutely. Actually, I have no choice.Fuckin' Hallenbeck killed the second and third teams.You know I don't enjoy doin' this, Jim. Jimmy curls up in a fetal ball. Marcon paces, shaking his head.I remember how much you hated the pain... You got hooked on Demerol, didn't you...? I'll make a deal with you. Tell me who you talked to, and I'll give you all the painkillers you can swallow.Now, see, I'd love to believe you. But we are talking about the future of my football team.And ain't nothin' more important than my ball club, 'cept maybe my collection of autographed footballs. Got one of yours, you know. Who'd you talk to, Jimmy?He's nothing, he can't hurt us. Take him somewhere and kill him.I... I don't remember, I... Joe shoves on the gun. The barrel chokes him.It's... Milo's film studio...You son of a bitch, you were gonna let him kill me!Kill them, Goddammit, waste 'em both!Wait. The gunmen lower their weapons.Let's humor this asshole. What are you talking about?You called the cops? Fuck it, they can't prove a thing.He's bluffing. He's not connected to the mob, what a load of horseshit. Nice try, asshole. Kill them.Jesus, I don't believe it. This guy's a riot.Where is the key, Jimmy?All right. Slow and easy.Hell with that, son. Hand it over or I'll have you kneecapped.Pull it out of there! One of them grabs a pair of tongs -- and the SHREDDER EXPLODES. Sprays the two hardguys. Cuts them to ribbons. Then, several things happen at once: Everybody goes for a gun. Hallenbeck lunges, scoops up a fallen pistol -- As Marcon draws his GUN and FIRES, missing -- Joe RETURNS FIRE, BAM-BAM -- ! Catches Marcon in the shoulder, and meanwhile --Shit, Joe Boy, you wasn't bluffing... He draws his gun. Blows out the glass. Reaches in. Opens the car door. Snatches up the briefcase.

He thinks he's fuckin' Ward Cleaver.All I wanted was to go to a party, but Pop here thinks I'm out to get laid.Sure thing, you dumb fuck-up.You'd probably like it. Hallenbeck takes her by the arm and drags her out of the chair. Toward her room.Why shouldn't I, Mom calls you that all the time. That stops him. He looks at her, stricken.On the phone to Uncle Jay.Because he doesn't fuck up. She goes into her room and shuts the door. Hallenbeck rubs his eyes. Leans against the wall, exhausted.You're Jimmy Dix, aren't you?I'm sorry I acted like a bitch. Would you sign my card? Hallenbeck steps forward.But, Dad -- !Aw, come off it.Billy... Hallenbeck recoils. Stares at her. The DOORBELL RINGS. Startling him. He mutters under his breath. Stalks out of the room.What do you need a boat for?Maybe... we should call the police.So... what do we do...?Is that gonna work?I'm scared.I don't know. I thought you'd... know what happened, know what to do... I mean, you were one of my dad's big heroes. Jimmy almost chokes...When I was little, he used to talk about you all the time. Best football player in the game. Great this. Wonderful that. You shoulda seen him when you got busted. Jimmy stares straight ahead. Takes a deep breath.Nice tux. He turns, and sees Darian Hallenbeck. Peeking her head out from under a tarpaulin.Fuck you, I stowed away. They're my parents, okay? Jimmy shakes his head. Exasperated.You look terrible.Are you really a drug addict?When?Don't let them break your other arm.Where are you going?Fuck you, man. No way.I'm not coming out! Jimmy looks up: The Senator's boat, a sleek, powerful Marlineer, is even now pulling out of the cove.See if this boat has sonar.Fuck you.Take a bath in my ass. They're clearly having no fun. CUT TO:Do you hear that -- ? And with that --spots him first. Sees her father bobbing like a cork in the ocean, screams:Daddy!! Jimmy whirls around, startled.Do something!

Chet's hand flashes out for a third slap -- And from nowhere, Joe Hallenbeck's hand magically appears. Intercepts the blow. Clamps onto Chet's hand and wrenches it. A cry of pain. Chet stumbles backward, cradling the wrist.Milo warned us to watch out for this guy. Chet is seething. He glares at Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck yawns.Jesus Christ. You son-of-a-bitch. Jesus Christ!! He rushes to Chet. Kneels beside him. Hallenbeck calmly returns to his seat.You killed him! 'Fuckin' A, you killed him, he's fuckin' dead!!! Hallenbeck says nothing.He killed Chet, Milo. The mother- fucker just killed him! Milo looks toward Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck says nothing. Instead, he calmly leans forward and picks up Chet's lighter from the carpet. Lights his cigarette. Blows smoke.approaches along the dock, looking lean and mean in an Izod shirt. He stops in front of Sarah and Joe Hallenbeck.Get up.Time for a little payback, Joe. Call it a service to dear departed Chet. He slams a fist into Hallenbeck's middle. Sarah cries out in alarm.How's that feel, fuckhead?All right, lovebirds, break it up. He yanks Sarah to her feet. Lets his gaze roam up and down her body.Nice tits. He rips open her blouse. Roughly fondles her breasts. Hallenbeck. On the ground. He growls with fury. Starts to push himself up.Stay down, fucker. Don't you move. At that moment, Milo comes striding down the dock. Whistling cheerfully.Face it, pal. You're fucked by God. CUT TO:Are you a literate man, Joe?That's good. See, Joe, what you're gonna do, you're gonna write a little story.Get him out of here. Take him to Mr. Marcon. I'll follow you as soon as my business here is finished. The Goon departs, leaving Hallenbeck with Pablo and two others. He studies them. Calculates the odds. Verdict: Bad.Yeah, you're gonna write a little story, Joe. About how guilt- stricken you are over Senator Baynard's death, which is all over the air waves, by the way. Yeah... you're so guilty about paying those hitmen to kill him, that you're gonna kill yourself.Oh, and, Joe...? Don't forget to include how guilty you are over that cop you murdered.That one.Shit, is he doing that? Hallenbeck's face remains cold. Expressionless.That's amazing, man!
