You know, I believe that there's always an area of agreement that two people can reach. The Clamp Corporation's LOGO a stylized \"C\" -- fills the wereen, replacing Clamp's image..obviously a sad occasion, but the bright side is that we can go ahead with something that will mean a great deal to the community down there...Forster, I've got the planning commission people coming in here today. Those condos I want to build, on top of the Chrysler building? We'rea a close to an okay.I'm going to a meeting about the Vermont thing. It looks like that takeover is going to happen.No kidding. How many guys do you know that have their own state? Did I show you that picture of the mountains?While I'm in there, get that revolving door fixed downstairs. It shorted out last night while I had some money people here. Mrs. Tanaka is still spinning.That's okay. Everybody just relax, and go back to what you'd be doing normally. I know I haven't been down here before, but that's going to change. I'm going to be a little more \"hands-on\" with these operations from now on... As he speaks, Clamp glances over Billy's shoulder, and spots the Chinatown drawing.You've captured the whole essence of the project here. Look at the kids with the kites. That's warmth. I like warmth. What's your name?That's what we need here. People who produce. Let's lose these elm trees, though. People think \"elm,\" they think \"Dutch,\" \"disease\" -- Gizmo's drawer rattles open. Billy snaps it shut.What's with that drawer?Huh. I didn't know about that one. He moves on, nodding vaguely at Marla -- who goes over to Billy, looking at him through completely new eyes.HAve you shredded my mail from this morning?Good. Let's do some memos...You're not my secretary. The Gremlin responds by grabbing a SILEX POT of boiling-hot water from the nearby coffee station, and FLINGING the boiling water at Clamp -- -- who ducks it, as it SCALDS the paint on the wall behind him. Clamp makes a tentative move toward the Gremlin, who THROWS the empty Silex. It barely misses Clamp, and SMASHES against the wall. The Gremlin JUMPS at Clamp, who tries to bat it away from his face, like a kid panicked by a moth -- -- but his flailing knocks the Gremlin back, so that its foot is caught in the hopper of the secretary's SHREDDER. Hating to do it, using only his fingertips, Clamp PUSHES the struggling Gremlin down into the machine -- -- which SPRAYS him out of the bottom like a black, bloody, eyes-only memo of DEATU. As Clamp stands gasping \u00c2\u00aede the machine, the door to the corridor opens, and Billlybu in. He sees the shredder, and 0 the tattered Gremlin remaips 4 j ng from it.I think so..-.I hate using these machines myself.Yeah? What happens at sundown?That's a good question, Bill. How dQ you know about them?Of course. Those guys. I warned you that could be a problem tenant. We could have had three shrinks and a plastic surgeon in that space. But no...I'll tell you what we have to do. We have to get a lid on this thing and keep it on. No cops, no media. We'll handle it. Go down to systems control and get on top of this thing..just tell then everything's under control, we've just had a few Clamp stops as he SEES a wall monitor with a ''CLAMP NEWS NETWORK\" sign under it.

As Fred speaks, Katsuji's CAMERA catches a fast GLIMPSE of GREMLINS in kids' clothes frolicking past in b.g. It's hard for Fred to shake his horror-movie training --Oh, shit.Bill -- how's it going out there? Any progress? Just tell me there's progress.Bad? It's horrible. There are people in this building. Real lives. You have any idea what kind of lawsuits we're looking at here?Help -- Billy grabs the RECEIVER of a VIDEO-PHONE end steps between Clamp and the Electric Gremlin. At the last possible instant, he holds the receiver up in the Electric Gremlin's path. The glowing beast touches the mouthpiece... .DISAPPEARS inside...and shows up an instant later on the video-phone's SCREEN -- trapped, writhing in pain, as RECORDED VOICES bounce around it and issue from the phone's SPEAKER.Uh, Bill -- thanks.I thought this would never run, Bill -- but maybe it will.The sign-off.

He watches through the door for a beat, then closes it -- and finds Kate suspiciously eyeing his lipstick tattoo.What -- this? It was just one of those business things. You know, like -- \"Great job.\" You don't believe me?We better get going.What kind of thing was in the trail mix?That's it. It's after midnight, and they've eaten. Now they'll make their cocoons...and if they get to water --Great. Maybe if we shut it off, they'll even close the place down... Billy goes to a corner of the chain-link cage and starts bending links back from the seam, trying to make a big enough opening to slip through.Nothing.You don't want to -- The guard ignores him, opens the zipper, and LOOKS DOWN into the bag.No! -- and as the Mogwai's departing FOOTSTEPS are heard, the guard angrily puts Billy up against the wall, starts handcuffing him.We have to find him, before he eats something -- GUARD b5 He already ate some i Billy looks around for Kate then realizes she's hiding in the 0 shadows of the concrete recess, unnoticed by the guard.Look, we have to shut this building down. That thing that bit you -- there are more of them, okay? And they're going to turn into -- these Monsters, and --Listen, I'm not crazy. People are going to be in a lot of danger. They wreck things. They kill people. If they get out of here, they'll destroy the whole city...they'll destroy everything. Listen to me...Thanks for getting \u00e2\u0096 e out of there.When we get there -- go to your job, like normal, okay? And just keep your eyes open. What time is it?Fred. I know...I'm going to go up and -- Now much?Put it on my bill.Remember, they can't stand bright light. If one of them gets near you -- He's interrupted as Marla comes up to them -- and gives Billy a squeeze and a kiss before he has time to think.Uh -- Marla, this is Kate, my --Uh, Kate -- listen, think I better explain --Kate -- fTerrific. As Billy heads for the elevators, HOLD on a nearby Miller's Outpost jeans store that opens onto the lobby. A couple of teenage girl SHOPPERS approach the SALES CLERK.Mister Forster -- \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd? FORSTER Zs: Peltzer! What are you doing in this building? You got yourself arrested here last night, and you come back? Get security up here. He's out. He starts to walk away, but Billy follows his.Mister Forster, we have to evacuate the building. Right now.There are ... creatures in the building. They start out as these small, furry animals, but then they eat, and they go into cocoons, and then they become small, green --Just listen to me --First they eat --Look I didn't make the rules. There are --Sir -- are you all right?Sir, I have to talk to you. There are a -- The door opens again, and a dishevelled Forster bursts in.Sir, please listen to me. There are more of these things -- maybe lots more. We've got to get people out of the building -- and we've got to close the building up. We've got to do it before sundown.These -- things can't stand sunlight. It'll kill them. But once it's night time, they can get out, into New York. If that happens --Well -- um, you know that genetics laboratory, down on --Sir, we have to make sure that none of these -- things get wet. If that happens --What? What happened?Try and calm down -- where were the -- But as Billy tries to understand Dr. Catheter --I'm afraid it's pretty bad right now, sir --Yes sir. We'll have to But as he speaks, the ELECTRIC GREMLIN emerges from a wall socket behind Clamp...Watch out!He's in the phone system...on hold. That should take care of him for a while.Sure. Mister Clamp, we have to stop these things from leaving the building. If they get out, that's it for New York -- at least New York. Clamp nods gravely, and takes a VIDEOCASSETTE from a drawer.What is it?Yes -- listen, sir, can you set the clocks in the building ahead three hours? All of them?Sunlight kills these things. That's why they're still in here. But when it's sundown -- or when they think it is -- they'll all get together in one place, so they can go out. They'll all be in the lobby.So around four-twenty -- just before they try to leave -- that's when we can make our move.It's just an idea...you'll have to set it up. From outside the building, if you can get out there.There's some things I still have to take care of in here. Things and. .people.Yeah. It's going to be tricky. But if it works -- you could save the city.Kate...? .a WIND STORM comes out of the VENTS. PAPERS from nearby offices swirl into the corridor. As Billy bats the flying memos away and struggles against the wind, he hears a NOISE in a nearby office, and goes inside to investigate.Yeah. Mr. Futterman, what are you doing here?0 That's Gizmo, Mister Fu tprtt He's on our side. Mr. Futterman gives Gizmo a hand down from the display case.I guess they -- pushed him too far.Thank God you're okay.Well -- Gizmo got wet, and then the Mogwais ate after midnight, and then some of the Gremlins must have mutated, from the genetic material.And if these things get out of here now --How come?I don't think we have tli\u00ef\u00bf\u00bde Kate. Let's no. `\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdDon't worry. In a few seconds, Mister Clamp's going to drop that cloth out there. The sunlight will come in, and --I know -- 0065Mr. Futterman. Get that hose. Aim it into the lobby.Just do it. Do it fast...Kate, get a box, and put Gizmo in it...keep him dry... Down in the lobby, the happy Gremlins keep moving toward the doors...Kate, there's a call on hold in Mister Clamp's office. Can you transfer it down here without going up there?Hurry. Kate hurriedly hands Marla the box containing Gizmo.That's it'. On the screen of the video-phone, the ELECTRIC GREMLIN writhes in agony, trying to gel off Hold, as the plastic button BLINKS beneath the screen. Billy grabs the phone fr d Kew,. lifts the receiver and holds it out over the mezzanine rani He looks down at the happily showering Gremlins -- -- PUSHES the blinking button dow -- and sees the Electric Gremlin SHOOT OUT OF THE RECEIVER, swooping down into the lobby --It wasn't just me, sir. Everybody helped. Marla here, and -- Clamp looks at Marla.I'm sorry about the building, sir.Well, you kept the city safe.Let me see... Re rummages -- comes up with paper and pencil from his pockets and hands them to Clamp. But as Clamp unfolds the paper --You want to move there?Uh, that's --Dad!Dad -- o -- but the splash f ater hits Gizmo with no effect, and everyone -- includ i the stolid Mogwai --
