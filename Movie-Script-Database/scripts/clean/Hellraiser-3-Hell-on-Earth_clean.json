But tonight, as you see, it's like Death took a holiday. It's a mystery to me ... A mystery how those assholes at Assignments knew it. This is Joey Summerskill for W-QQY. Emergency Room. No story. Really, really pissed off.Ah, break it down, Doc. It's a bust.I know. I know. But it's just so ... neat, isn't it? The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me.Better hurry, Doc. A real story. With a real reporter.You'd lose the money-shots. No. I'll catch a bus. Or a cab. Don't worry about it. Go.That is the story of my life.What's going on?What happened to him?Wait! I'm a reporter! Tell me where he was ...Hold on. Hold on, please. I need talk to you.Where?Under the Underground? What's that? Where is ...What do you mean?Fuck you.Jesus Christ ...Yeah? Well, you just struck out. It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way. Not tight skirts. Tight stories.I know what I saw.There's a story out there.No. Not on station time. My story. My time.God. This better be birth, marriage, or death ...Uh-huh?Joey. Yeah, who is this?Right. Right!I want to talk to you. We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.Yeah. Sure. You mean ... tonight?No. No. It's fine. Come now. I was having bad dreams anyway.I put some decaf on. Er ... make yourself comfortable.What?Oh yeah ...... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything. It's ... well, I know what it is.Why are you so interested?No. No, it's OK. I ... It's my father.God, no! Nothing like that. No, he died before I was born. He died in Vietnam. I never knew him. Never met him. We don't even know the details. I dream of battlefields. Of searching. Of trying to find out.What?I know what you're saying but ... Never? You've never had a dream? No, you know, you do. You must. What you mean is you don't remember them.Uh ... yeah. Yeah, somewhere. Wait a minute.I'm trying to quit.Sorry. It was my father's. It's temperamental.Yes I do. Terri, something awful happened to that boy. I have to find out what it was.Did you know him?Taken what?Wait a minute. He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?Wait. Wait. The chains. Where did the chains come from?Oh my God ...Did I sleep through an earthquake?Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri. Can I ask? Is it always this ... exploratory?I'll boil some water.No! No, that's OK. I like to. I love boiling water. It's a specialty of mine. Why don't you go watch cartoons?The bank owns it. But I'm working on it.How have you ... ?No. I buy them to impress people. Of course I've read them.I don't think so. But it's a fascinating subject. Did you ...Actually, I'm pretty familiar with the view ...... but it is good. You know, over to the left, you can ...I don't know his name ... I saw the whole story. A wounded bird was on his roof. I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it. I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't. Its pain spoke directly to him. He picked it up. Nursed it. Fed it. And it got better. Everyday he'd watch the pigeon. Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away. Didn't look back. But he heard the sound of its wings.Every day.No. He knows it won't. It was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him doesn't yet.What? I wasn't talking about ... I ... Do you want to stay? You want to stay here for a while?OK. OK. It's a done deal. But look \u0096 you have to help me. I've got to solve this thing. I've got to know what's going on.Maybe not. But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?Woah. Wait a minute. Who? The kid?That you found. What do you mean you found it?Would you know this store again?It's Saturday morning. Let's go shopping.Jesus. Are you sure this is the street?What on earth were you doing down here?Terri?Oh, Terri ...Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...Yes. Thank you. We were wondering ... Terri, show her the box.No. No, you don't understand. We're not selling it. It came from here. We want ...No. We want ...Thank you. This came off a ... statue? A pillar. We wondered if you knew anything about the piece. About where it came from.Fine. Fine. But can you tell us anything about it?What else came with it? Anything still here?Can we see?I don't know. Maybe.Terri, check out the other folder.God knows. Anything. Contacts. Clues.Alright ...Help me pick 'em up, Terri. I think the lady just made a sale.Yeah ... yeah ... yeah ... No, it's important that I speak to ... What? No, don't ... Put. Me. On. Hold. You. Stupid. Bitch.Hi. Now listen. And listen good. I'm the Station Manager at W-QQY. For the last half-hour you've been dicking around with my assistant. Let me tell you something. With or without your co- operation we are making this expose. I assume you're smart enough to guess which version is going to make you look good. Now, if you can't put one hand on that cassette and the other on a FedEx man's butt within thirty seconds then you damn well better put me through to somebody who can.Dr. Fallon? How nice of you to take my call. I understand you're in charge of video archive from the Channard Institute ... ?Terri?In your dreams, pal.Shit. Why now? Why not last week? Oh ...Goodnight, Terri ...Alright ... Let's see what we got here.Hi. You've reached Joanne Summerskill. In spirit at least. Please leave a message. Thanks.Terri, we can't bunk up every night! People will ...... talk. ... Terri?Oh shit.Noooooooooo .......Nooooooooooo!Is somebody here? Is somebody here!? Terri ... ?What ... What's going on? What's happening?How .... ?Tell me ... Tell me ...

And now there's no way out. I've had dates like you before. I ...Thanks. I think.What's going on? Is this a dream?Wait ... wait. You ... you have to help me. I don't understand. Am I dreaming this?It's ... I don't know. First World War, right?Joey Summerskill.Captain Spenser. Elliott. I ... What the Hell is going on?And what is ... this frozen moment?And what did you discover?And why are you back? Why are we here?Kirsty Cotton. Yes. But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?What will he do? What does he want?What can we do?I don't know ...Then tell me what to do.So where is it?Wha .... ?Hello?Doc? ... Doc ...
