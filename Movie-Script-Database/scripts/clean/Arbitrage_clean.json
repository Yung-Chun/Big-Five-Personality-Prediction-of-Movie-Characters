{"Arbitrage": {"ROBERT": {"raw_line": "I'm a child of the 50's. My father welded steel for the Navy. And my mother worked at the VA.They lived through the Depression, Pearl Harbor, and the Bomb. And they didn't think bad things might happen; they knew they would happen.When I was a kid my favorite teacher was Mr. James. Mr. James said that world events always revolve around five things:This was fifth-grade econ. But this is something we've seen over and over again, time and time again, that competition for this-- limited amount of dollars out there, can make even the best of us manic. So it's not surprising that we see these asset bubbles, but when reality sets in of course, they burst.Quants? Derivatives structures? What was that about?That's what you said last week. Why'd we go down there?And did we sign?No. We did not. Instead I fly two thousand miles for a marketing meeting... And where was Mayfield? What was this \"emergency\"? What was that about?Why?Hi, guys! Goldenrod - 4.17.11 5.It's my job! It's my job. You guys turned out fine!(to Peter, as they hug andNo, no that's okay. Where's my drink, is this mine, here?Thank you, thank you, thank you all very much, it's such a surprise, I didn't even know it was my birthday!What did Mark Twain say about? He said-- old age... is clearly a case of mind over matter. If you don't mind, it doesn't matter. I've done a lot of things in my life, worked very hard, but being here, looking around-- at all these shining, radiant faces, I know that my best work is right here in this room, right now... I'm deeply proud of all of you. That's the best gift your mother and I could have hoped for, so, thank you...That, too, Peter, but- no business tonight-- no business!Although your one-track mind assures me you've got not only your mother's genes, but you've got mine, too!Now, I'm aware that may seem uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me sixty years to realize what's truly important -- and it's you guys so thank you all very much.Kids are wild.No, no no, you should have-- I want more \"you's\" around.Yeah, yeah yeah...What?Yeah, well... I just... wanted it to be about the family tonight.Yeah... Oy. You know how I feel about that. Trash can.Well, you gonna keep skirting around it?My darling, you are still in your 20's. I am 60. That's a big difference in point of view.It catches up alright. And maybe there's some other things I'd like to do. Maybe I would like to spend a little more time with you guys... outside the office.What?Office.Yeah I gotta finish up that thing.I'll be back as soon as I can.Yeah, Gavin, it's me, uhh... When you get this -- I want you to call Chris Vogler at Fremaut, tell him I need to see him right away, okay?Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late. I'm always late-- you know that-- and I'm sorry. And I'm always saying I'm sorry about being late. It doesn't mean I wouldn't rather be here with you.The show's gonna be beautiful.(slight beat, thenOh wow, that's great. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 11.You made this? This is amazing. One candle, thank you very...I'm here.Jeffrey, I told you, I'm...Jeffrey... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 12.What do you want me to say?I am solving the problem. I am getting you your money and your fee. You will have them very shortly.As soon as they sign the contract....Stop it! You don't have to talk to me like that!...You were a friend of mine!... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 13.(stands, heading to doorYou can't do that......I need the money there until they sign, Jeffrey. What if they check again?Not your fuckin problem...Let's go.What?Good. Very good.Is this too blue?Ay, yay yay. I look old.They haven't signed the papers.So did I, but for some reason they're stalling. I didn't get any sleep on the plane and...What plan is that?You sound like a fortune cookie.Then you married an idiot.There hasn't been time.I don't wanna be in the cemetery!I'm taking care of it.I've had to move some things around for the merger.Only two million?You remember-- Riccio's? Full meals... two bucks... all you can eat... three bucks...I don't know what you're talking about...Where the hell is Mayfield?I hope they didn't beat you up too much.I'd love to hear about that, but... I had thought Mr. Mayfield planned to join us tonight.I'm sorry, gentlemen, we've been here nearly two hours now. Where is Mr. Mayfield?Detained where?Alright, I think I can leave you with my family?Yeah, yeah yeah.No. What's up?What is it?BROOKE--What kind of entries?Alright, come by about eleven tomorrow and we'll look at it then. And Brooke?See if you can find out what happened to Mayfield.How're they doing?Yeah, but how are they doing?Where's Julie?Hey, Julie.Oh, really? Painter?Yeah, that's great. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 22.I like the size of the paintings, I wanna talk to you about them in a second.What? Why are you doing this?I will take those two. And the Rubik's cube on the back wall.Don't tell her it was me. I mean it.It's me.I'm here.I'm in your bedroom. Can you get those people out of here?Look down the hall. Do you see me? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 24.Okay, so I'm serious.I thought we should talk......I was working, do you understand? I'm under enormous pressure, I have obligations...I was there! I was there! I was late, but I was there. And I'm here now.I'm sorry.Because I liked them.Julie, you're not gonna fail. Why would you fail?You know, I'm not the kinda guy who wants to throw money away but if you wanna start a business, you have to project a certain image.Success.The market's a disaster right now; nobody's moving anything. That's why you gotta show sales. People look at you then and they say \"Whoah, how'd she do that?\" -- and that's what they remember. Always.Come away with me. Let's just take your car and go...There's a place upstate. Very beautiful, on the water. We can wake up there together- just you and me. I'd like that.Yes, I wanna make it collect...Lawrence Grant.Jimmy, it's me.I want you to listen to me very closely...Let's go.It's better you don't ask.That's correct.No, you're not. We're not here.We're both alseep right now. At home. Which is where you left your phone, right?Because if anyone checks...They're not, as long as we're not here. Anybody know you're here?Somebody knows you're here?But somebody knows-- you're not there.Oh, Jesus, Jimmy...What'd you say?Do you trust her?Do you trust her?Good. So you're at home, and I'm at home. My wife gets up at five am for Pilates -- I will be there next to her, where I've been all night. And you'll do the same with yours.Jimmy......what do you want, you want money? I will give you five thousand dollars! I will give you ten thousand dollars! I'll give you whatever you fuckin'...Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not myself. I need your help.No, I just... have to get home... I'll deal with it in a couple of hours.Then I don't make it.Better we don't talk for a while.I'm sorry, Jimmy. I really am. Just go home.I'm fine, Glen. Go back to bed.What?I just went to... eat some ice cream.Yes...Ellen...Do you still love me?And such a person...Fingerprints, DNA?What about cell phone records?Not from a cell phone, no.What would you advise such a person to do?Failing which?Yeah.I know.You tell me what happens if the Standard deal does not close, and I gotta tell my investors about our real losses?And what'd you say about the Justice Department? Depending on what they decide to arrest me on-- fraud conviction gets me twenty years?What choice do I really have?Of course I am aware. I gave testimony to the committee. You know this. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 37.No. Absolutely not. That's impossible.The audit's cleared?You're leaving?And why?Get out.What?What?What the fuck are you talking about?Oh... Oh, it was fine...He's here? Where?He called?You think we're dealing with a fucking idiot?That's being issued now.Never mind that, just find out why Mayfield hasn't called us. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 39.Do I have to do every Goddamn thing myself? JUST FIND OUT! WILL YOU PLEASE...? THANK YOU!Reconcile what?Of course I'm listening. Okay, those trades are in the special book. They don't get audited on the same balance sheet.That's ridiculous. That can't be right.Okay, I'll look into it. I promise you I'll look into it.Yeah.Give me two minutes, then send him in...Yes, my other meeting just got here early. We'll have to pick this up later.Brooke, we'll pick it up later, alright? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 41.Yeah, I'm sorry to keep you waiting. You can sit there. We just heard about it. Really terrible.Correct.Through... I think it was a charity function. My wife and I have a foundation.Last night, at the gallery.No, I think I left about ten.Home.Yeah.Yeah.Yes.See her with anyone-- what do you mean?Not that I noticed. No. No, no.The driver?This is awful. This is truly awful.Actually we didn't talk about personal matters.Well not an employee. I was an investor.Why did I invest?She had a great eye. She found me those Bryce Marden's there. They went up in value very quickly, and on the basis of that I agreed to fund some of the gallery.Why would I mind?Oh, right. Yeah. Of course. Sure, go ahead.Mmm-hmm? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 44.Actually I said that she wasn't an employee, but-- I think she'd just come over from Paris if I remember, and she needed a place to entertain buyers.It was through our holding company. You seem a little confused by all this...Alright.But you're going to be indelicate...Oh, okay, I get it, so why would I invest in her and help her find a place?It's very simple, detective. I invest in people I believe in. I thought she'd do well, so I backed her, she did. It's is simple as that. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 45.Sure.What?Oh, no, I just hit it on the medicine cabinet.This morning.Yeah. Me, too.No problem.Her Mom...? Service here?Well we should pick up the expenses for that. Whatever she wants. You'll take care of that personally, for me?You reach Mayfield?Thanks. Appreciate your concern.You're gonna sign him out?The basketball player?He's the best?You've gotta get Jimmy out of this.What would he be looking at?Come on, get in.Jimmy...It's gonna be okay.We've got you the best criminal lawyer--Cause he woulda fucked it up, okay?Your under suspicion.I am aware of that.I couldn't.Because I have responsibilities. And if I stayed there, a lot of people would've been hurt.Other people, Jimmy. I've got business troubles, you understand...? People rely on me.Listen... I want to talk to you a second. Come here. I wanna show you something.Now, you know, your father asked me to look after you.Yeah, I know I messed up, alright? I'm sorry. But I do want to help you, you know that. So I've been able to set up a situation for you.It's a trust. In your name, assets of $2 Million dollars. Take a look at that.What else is there?What are you gonna do? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 56.I don't know, Jimmy. I don't know. Are you?Wait, wait, wait. Sorry. Just-- read it. Just take it home and read it. It's not gonna hurt you.What?Yeah, put him through... Chris...What...?Chris...Chris? CHRIS! Goddamnit, Chris! Goldenrod - 4.17.11 57.Tell me what is going on.Tell me what's going on!Why not?!What do you mean it's not...?The audit passed? What do you mean the audit passed?Then... why did you tell me that it didn't? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 61.They? Who's they? Who is they?!Mayfield?They're negotiating. He wants a better price.Sherry Netherland...? Yes, James Mayfield, please... Mr. Mayfield... I think it's time we had a talk.Did we have a meeting?Sweetie, you okay? What's wrong?You wanna sit?I did.Because I hoped you wouldn't.I made a bad bet.That's a dangerous word, Brooke.Because we were going broke! Everything was finished. We'd have nothing.You remember Alexanderov? Well he came to see me one day last year. He said \"Robert, we've got a great opportunity- there's a copper mine, it's in Russia, it's under- exploited- there's billions under the ground, and to get it out, all we need is a couple hundred million, you put in a hundred, we'll put in a hundred- we'll triple it all in six months.\" So, I go check it out. And the geological survey's right, friendly government. And to lock it in, you hedge it, right? Sell the copper ahead on the commodities exchange and it all works, it's fine, and you're making a fortune. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 65.But then there's something I hadn't accounted for-- variation margin-- and that friendly Russian government all of a sudden not so friendly anymore and they're blocking the export of the copper so I gotta make it up, I gotta put the cash in to cover the hedge. But I'm not worried about it because it's still springing money, there's so much money coming out of the ground you can't believe. You can't stop it. And, yes, I'm the oracle, I've done housing, I've arb'd credit swaps, I have done it all, and yes, again, I know it's outside the charter, but it is FUCKING MINTING MONEY! IT'S A LICENSE TO PRINT MONEY! FOR EVERYBODY! FOREVER! IT IS GOD!...Until it's not... The money's trapped. You can't get it out. Probably never will. It's like a plane crash. It just happens.Not just happen, honey you are so naive sometimes. It HAPPENS. And like every father I pray that it doesn't HAPPEN to you, which, thanks to me, it probably won't happen to you...Nobody's getting arrested. That's why I borrowed the money from Jeffrey. Plug the hole, I put it there for a month, they see the books are fine, I transfer the company, I pay back Jeffrey-- with interest!-- make all of our investors whole, and what's left we keep. At least we get to keep the house. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 66.Yes.You don't have to lie. You didn't know about it.What did you want me to do? Did you want me to let our investors go bankrupt? Is that what you wanted? For people to get really hurt?Because it's my job!You are not my partner! You work for me! That's right. You work for me! Everybody works for me!Brooke. Brooke. Come here. Please? Please. Just, just come here. Just for a second and sit down.There's something I wanna tell you. And whatever you decide I won't blame you... I'm on my own path. It's up to you to move with it or against it. But I'm the patriarch; that's my role. And I have to play it.I'm sorry.You're certain?He's not like us.(laughs, plays with hisShe's good. Fine. Why?Yes...?The estate lawyer?Not to me.I am so, so sorry.No...It's just... not fair, is it?This shouldn't have happened.You keep sending people to my office to \"do business.\"With the intricacies of my operation so that you can... not buy it? Just coffee, please.Fuck you. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 80.FUCK - YOU. I'm the Oracle of Gracie Square. You came to me. I did not come to you.No, no, no. Forget it, forget it... Forget the deal. I don't even care about the deal. No, I run a comfortable -- excuse me -- I run a THRIVING business, that has returned year-to-date 15.4% percent to our investors, or approximately $583 Million dollars from a trading operation that you don't have and that we both know that you need, or else you never would've called me in the first place. You on the other hand, you've taken a salary of 18 Million? And what have you delivered? A falling stock price of negative 14 dollars? Is that what it is? You've also lost approximately... THREE AND A HALF BILLION FOR YOUR INVESTORS- TELL ME -- WHY - THE FUCK - DO I - NEED YOU?...so we issue a press release today, say there is no deal, never was a deal. You're not gonna be buying Old Hill, you're not gonna be buying Quantum- you're not gonna be buying anything; You? You're just a browser. Now, me? I'll continue to enjoy my earnings, and while I SOAR on princely wings, to my next winning enterprise, your stock drops another couple bucks on yet another - failed - acquisition - attempt. Bodes well for your tenure, doesn't it? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 81.You have a nice day, James.Five-fifty.Five twenty-five. That's it. Yes or no? And if it's no, send any further communication right to my trash can.One other thing -- six months and I'm gonna be gone. I'm outta here. My daughter's gonna take it over. You know her, you trust her.And you're gonna have to make my son a VP.No, no. He doesn't have to do anything, he just gets the salary, he gets the office. Both of `em on five-year employment contracts, and my lawyers draft them. Yes or no?I'm writing the deal.I'm serious. I'm very serious. Sign it.I'm fine... Before I go -- how much would you have paid...?Four seventy-five.Yeah.Actually, I lied. I would've taken four....Anyway I will be seeing most of you at the gala tomorrow night. But as the sale's official as of this afternoon, you are now free to talk about it. Any questions?Yes, everyone but you. Alright, it's a great day. Your hard work made it happenI met his price. I just took it out of your share.Yeah.Well, thank you. Now go get me that fucking hospital check.Yeah.Hello.What you got?You got any milk?I'll take a water.Where are you going?The boxes.I told you not to take the toll.I said \"Listen to what I have to tell you and follow my directions, listen to me closely, do the following just like I say.\"But you took the toll anyway.Come on, Jimmy, don't fucking lie to me...So where'd they get the photograph from?So, you're saying... it's a fake?Don't be such a wiseass...What plan?What business?What's an Applebee's?You bought an Applebee's in Virginia?It's not really that simple, Jimmy. I'm in a situation now.I told you... right now, if I were to speak, a lot of people would get hurt. Jobs, families. A lot of innocent people. Do you think you can understand that?It was an accident.Can you just hang tight? Just a little longer?Alright I hear you. I'll be back with you as soon as I can. Just hang with me a little bit.He says he didn't take the toll.Does Standard have clawback?Let's just say I decide to go in...No, just listen, listen to me. If I were to surrender, now, could they roll back the deal?Four years, you think?Call the DA, get it started.Yeah, Glen. Did Mrs. Miller say where she was going tonight...? Aha... No, I'm sure... I'll try her cell.Syd...? Yeah- Did you make that call to the DA yet...? Thank God. No, no, no. No. Listen to me, call Earl, tell him to get his car, tell him to meet us at my house in twenty minutes... And, Syd...? Bring a notary.Wait. Wait. Just wait.The Lexus- that's your car, your plate?You got Jimmy's?Son of a bitch.You didn't hurt anybody. You helped a lot of people. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 95.No, it makes it easier.No.Okay, we're even. But just for the record though, what you did... Was way beyond the money.Thanks a lot.Hey, sweetie. What time you wanna get there...? I don't wanna get there too soon...You okay? What is it?Did she tell you that?Yeah, I explained to Brooke that...Yes.What?Ellen I don't know what you think you know...What do you think you know?I did what was necessary.For my interests?Everything I do is for us, for this family, and now you're gonna tell me how to run my business.What you've tolerated? Wow!What about me? What about the complaints? The unhappiness? The drinking? The shopping? The trainers? Everything! But yes, the charities, the wonderful sainted charities, you know, all the wonderful works that you do. How do you think I've paid for them?It's cause you didn't want to give `em up!No, I kept her out.What is this?\"All ownership and voting rights transfer to the Miller Charitable Foundation, to be administered by Brooke Miller?\" Did you really expect me to sign this thing?Apparently not, no. No.Yeah, this leaves me with nothing.This is fuckin' crazy.You're out of your mind. I am not signing that. I will not sign that!That's fucking ridiculous! What... Are you trying to blackmail me?You're not gonna win that one. There's no fucking way.Fucking lawyer...Fuck the DNA! I'm sick of this!You won't do it. You won't do this. You won't do it to the kids.It's how it all works, Ellen. You know that.She'll be better for it. The world is cold.

fuck is this?Robert?You gonna tell me what this is?So all you're sayin' is, you need a ride somewhere. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 30.Because I want to be very clear about this: you called me to give you a ride. I'm giving you a ride.Oh, no? Then where the fuck are we?Right.Why is anyone gonna check?No.No!Well, my girl...Man, you call up two am, what the fuck you want? She asked me where I was going. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 31.I told her I had to run out a minute.Is this the kinda shit you used to do to my dad?Yes, I fucking trust her!This is some pretty fucked up shit.No, man, come on, I don't hear from you since the fuckin' funeral, you call me up out of the blue, using my father's name, ask me...You wanna talk to me like that you can get the fuck outta my car and you can walk! You want that?! You wanna fuckin' walk home?!You alright?Jesus, man! We gotta get you to a hospital.What if you don't make it a couple of hours?Call me, alright, and let me know it's okay.So what you get in a bind and just call up the only nigger you know? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 33.Yeah, alright, man. Take care of that.Yes?What's this about?Am I under arrest?Man, for what? My answers ain't gonna change.Right. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 51.Right.I don't think I wanna answer any more questions.I want to talk to my lawyer.Well if you got all that, what the fuck you need me for, officer?Lawyer.All you said was you wanted a fucking ride! You didn't tell me you killed that girl!I'm trying to put my life back together. Okay, I appreciate you helped us, but now you're pushing it too far.Like it was your ass sitting in there? Like you know a fucking thing about how it's gonna be?--Don't you got your own son for this? Why the hell you didn't call him?Well I'm sorry your son's a fuckin' idiot, but that ain't my fault.Oh, okay. So tell us then, Syd, what happens now?Under suspicion? Motherfucker, I'm Black!And what exactly would you like me to do about it?Why couldn't you have just stayed?Why not?Somebody was hurt. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 55.Yeah.What's that?Are you serious? You think money's gonna fix this?Yo, yo man, pull over.I look like a fucking snitch to you?Oh, man, what?Where? Back to the station?What if I say no?

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 29.They can't handle one drunk motorist kills herself?... So who kicked out the door?Detective Bryer. I was hoping to see Mr. Miller.Possibly.Okay, so you were an investor in her gallery?How'd you meet her?Uh-huh. When'd you last see her?Did you stay till the doors closed?Where'd you go? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 42.You go straight home?You stay home?Your wife home?Okay. Okay, so now, back to the gallery. Did you see her with anyone?You know like a boyfriend, someone she might've left with?Reason I ask, is, that we haven't located the driver.Yeah, someone else was driving. Sometimes, the driver, will go for help-- and he'll die tryin', you know... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 43.We're searching the area right now. So no boyfriend that you know of?She was just an employee, right?Why'd you invest?Yeah, why'd you invest?Would you mind if we searched her apartment?It's in your company's name.Now, Mr. Miller...Why would you lease an apartment for Ms. C\u00f4te? Is that something you normally do for your employees?So you leased her this apartment.I am. But I'll get there. Gimme time.Now, I don't mean to be indelicate...Well, from what I've been able to gather, she wasn't exactly an art star. I mean, she worked for a couple a dealers in Paris, but...Something like that, yeah.(nods, stands as RobertThanks.What happened to your head?That's a nasty cut; I've been looking at that for the last five minutes. Does it hurt you?Last night?Hate when that happens.Well, thanks for the chat.Mrs. Miller?Detective Bryer.Yeah, I was hoping to talk to you.Just take a couple a seconds. It's about your husband.Well, the wife blew me off-- which was interesting. And he didn't admit to the affair, but then he wouldn't, would he?He's a very rich man. What happened with the pay phones?And the one we care about?Who'd he call?(thinks, gets up andand you're a billionaire, right? You're a billionaire-- so whaddya do...? (Mills shrugs for theJust get in the car, Jimmy.You wanna be?So let's do this again.You were asleep.And your phone rings.And it's a wrong number.Why do you accept the charges on a collect call from a wrong number?And you stay on the phone a minute and a half on a wrong number? What the fuck do you talk about, area codes?I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation here, Jimmy. This is a homicide.This is not going to go away.Nah, they're all dead.Well, he had an excellent lawyer.We pulled his parents' tax returns. Guess where his father worked for twenty years?The warrant doesn't need to hold. It just needs to scare him into giving up Miller. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 62.This is about Judge Rittenband, isn't it? It's cause he's running again?I'm getting a piece of new evidence that'll seal it a hundred percent.I'll have it before you go in the jury room... Look, Ray. We like this kid. I don't wanna lose him. Think about it: if we flip him, you get Robert Miller. What's that worth to Rittenband, and to you for that matter...? Twenty years, Ray. Twenty fucking years, we watch these guys- they out-lawyer us, they out-buy us. I'm fucking sick of it. Where's the consequence? The guy did it. He does not get to walk just cause he's on CNBC.Yeah... I need a serious fuckin' favor... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 63.Jimmy, take a ride with me.No man, just get in the car.I'm not threatening you. I'm just asking you -- take a ride with me.Look, it's pretty fuckin' simple. I know you went to pick him up.And I know why.Take a look at this. I've got his phone calls, I got his text messages. I've got the relationship with the girl. And they were fucking, by the way. And then I've got you. I've got the time log from the pay phone. I've a got a fucking tollbooth photograph of you driving your car through the Triborough.Really?You lied to me. You lied to the police. You obstructed justice.Fuck Earl! You see this? (holds up the grand juryLook: I know you think Miller's your friend.I know about your father.I know Miller paid his bills while he was dying. I know he got Syd Felder to get you out of trouble on your gun charge. That doesn't add up to this.Okay, he's driving, he crashes- he runs away- who does he call? Calls you. Why do you think that is? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 70.`Cause you're disposable- you're the one person he could call that just doesn't fuckin' matter. You're a- you're a throwaway. You're just another part of his transaction.So what, what? You're his new nigger now?You didn't kill that girl. He did.He's using you. I know it - you know it. Do the right thing. Now get outta my fuckin' car.I can halt the decision.What about you, Jimmy? You need a minute?Cause if you do we could...So you wanna keep playing games? Or you ready to tell me something?We didn't lie. You lied.Sure it wasn't. And it was a telemarketer called you from the pay phone? He stopped at the Chevron to make a late night sale?Well, tell him. Go ahead, Jimmy. Tell him. See how the boss'll like this one.Last chance.Your honor...We don't know where it is.It's not in the evidence locker.We don't know.We lost it. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 93.I'm sorry?Oh, okay. So let me get this straight: What you're telling me is I'm supposed to sit around with my thumb up my ass and my fingers crossed hoping that one of these fucking days, somewhere down the line, one of these rich assholes is gonna say the wrong thing LOUD enough so that we can't choose to ignore it anymore?Yes, your honor.Well when do you expect her...? When do you expect her? Okay, well so I don't have to call a ninth time, will you take down what I'm sayin', word for word...? Okay, you got a pencil? You ready?
