I'm sure you have a hotter date than this tonight.Just when my self esteem was gettin' so healthy.You're giving Deke the gold shield.That gold shield was the first one in four years... Sir... I'm going to have to resign, and take that position overseas. TWB 6.Frank, I'm nearly forty. I can't be on the streets much longer. Not if I don't know there's something on the other end.Me too.I'm doing this for us. If I have a better job, I can give you guys more.Come here.Of course. It's been four years. Things are getting back to normal over there.I thought this was peanut butter but-- TWB 11.Hon, they're all yours.No. I'm the polite one.Sorry pal, I'm not for sale.Just once.You probably shouldn't have let her drink that much.Well I did. And now we're both leaving.Let's move. We're gonna be late.Feel free to sit wherever you like.Great, well... I just asked them to sit.Okay, I'm going to be talking about crime scene investigation today. If we could--Actually, you sign the attendance at the end of the session. It's a UN mandate--We sign later. TWB 16....Keeping the crime scene clean is number one.We have to go to the hospital together.We got here as quick as we could.What did he say?Isn't she filing a complaint?She has to file a complaint. A woman gets stabbed in the face and there are no repercussions?With no police reports?.. Maybe, if you go back to the hospital... You can pull the records for every one of her visits.Okay, now get the same thing from all the doctors who treated her. They will have to testify on Zlata's behalf.This is good. Let's cross reference each injury with other cases where felony assaults were ruled. Can you get something like that?... Because if stabbing someone in a bar is illegal then the same standard can be applied to a domestic assault.If an attorney presents this properly, referencing international standards, you might be able to get a conviction.Sorry, you wanted to see me?What? Why?Ms. Rees, I--Is this about Zlata Sehik? If I've overstepped protocol--Absolutely.I know hon, it's very exciting. If this works out. It's a real opportunity for the future, but it means I have to, I have to extend my contract for another six months... Hello?.....Erin?No I didn't. I'll look right now.You look beautiful...Mission Headquarters... UNMHQ.I know. I don't even know if I'm still IPTF.Oh... I, I thought I was reporting to Madeleine Rees' Office.It's fine. Thanks for the tour.It's not a date... No, seriously. It's not. I know you had a lot to do with my promotion, so I wanted to thank you.Listen to me. I'm not joking around. You're a nice guy. But I...You must be in heaven over here.You don't find that--I can't afford to mess this up.Ask my two ex-husbands.They're all widows?Except us.Thanks for taking me through this. Fill me in when you're done, and I'll send my report to Rick Jones.It's okay, it's--Call a medic!Who is she?Yeah. Good. I'll follow up at the bar.Where exactly is this bar?What's going on here?Hold on. Where are the IPTF monitoring this raid?Is that the owner? Are you taking him into custody? TWB 30.Is there a translator on the scene? Translator?... Wait.This is Kathy Bolkovac. I need an Interpreter. At the Florida Bar.Now.Hey. I'm from Gender Affairs. I--Is that the owner? I tried to get an interpreter but--Oh... Okay. But there's... We just had two girls come in to a Human Rights Office, saying they escaped from this place.Well, the girls in our field office seemed pretty scared. I should follow up with these ones.Thanks. I'll look out for your report.Jesus... TWB 32.Foreign objects?When will he know?But if there are so many victims.But these girls aren't prostitutes.Where can they get help?Where are the other girls from the Florida bar?The local police were bringing them here.I'll tell you about it over a drink. Could you just check something for me? I want to get a copy of the monitor's report from a raid on the Florida Bar yesterday.No. That's definitely it. There were six girls removed from the bar and I need to know where they were taken. TWB 36.I'm looking for Fred Murray?Is it okay for me to be here?I just wanted to follow up with you on the raid yesterday. Those girls didn't show up at the Shelter, and I wanted to locate them.Waitresses aren't kept under lock and key.Kathy. The new Head of Gender Affairs.What do you mean?They're critical... witnesses for a situation I'm... monitoring. I'll need to speak with them when they're ready.Will you be contacting their parents?The other girls from the raid were supposed to go to the Women's Medica Shelter, but they never showed up. Do you have any idea where else they might have been taken?Go home. TWB 40.How can you go up there, when you know what happens to these girls?They're thirteen, fourteen, fifteen--No... I'm not okay. These girls... What are these guys thinking?Can you tell me what you know? TWB 41.Fred Murray. There were other officers too. But the raid was not in the books. These girls were just sent back. They are clearly not waitresses. They are victims. I think IPTF were paid off to turn a blind eye.Raya and Irka could be key witnesses in a UN investigation. I thought we were all on the same team.Please, just let her stay two weeks. Then we can take it from there.Two weeks. If she's going to testify, she's not safe anywhere else.There is another option... I want to help you find your friends. But you need to help me do that.None of this is your fault. I want to go after the people who hurt you. But I need to know exactly what happens. As a witness in UN custody, you will be protected and will not be charged for any crimes.I have a daughter, just your age... I wouldn't stop until I found her.Do you know this man?I need to get evidence. How many girls do you have here?Do you have any more pictures?Erin. What are you doing? TWB 48.Yeah. I just was thinking about you.Yeah. Of course, I just... It's great to hear your voice.Busy. I followed up on the Florida Bar. It's worse than I thought. There was a protection racket. IPTF... Americans, Romanians, were taking pay-offs to make sure the place wasn't busted. That raid was a punishment bust, because the owner stopped paying. But he must've settled it because the girls are right back where they started. Locked up in the hills.I talked to thirty five girls at the Shelter. All this testimony can't be ignored. Our guys are patronizing the bars in large numbers. Rick, serious abuses are taking place. It's all in my reports.I've got two girls ready to testify about IPTF taking pay-offs--In court.I know. But there must be some channel, some exception--So the Americans aren't legally accountable for anything?To do what?You don't need to worry about me.So Fred Murray could just walk up to a man and shoot him in daylight and he'd never see the inside of a courtroom?I wanted these girls to testify in a trial against the IPTF officers. But--Okay, but if the girls testify in a Bosnian court against their trafficker... Tanjo... they'd have to mention what else goes on in the brothels.That is their testimony. Then it would be on record. Somebody would have to pay attention. Like...the State Department?...and the two girls have to go to the hospital to get immunized, or they can't stay in the country. I need an armored security vehicle.I'm looking for--Where's Irka?I'll be right behind you. Are you okay?So we get her one. Where is she?She is a witness for a UN investigation!You had no right to do that!Where did they take her?If you know anything, this is on you.I'm looking for a girl. She was dropped here a few hours ago.Can you check the border logs? She's about 15, the police brought her here but she didn't have a passport. Maybe--Irka!Let's go back to the Florida Bar--I don't care! I have nothing else to go on, do I?Fuck!She's fifteen. I'm begging you--If you know any of the other bars he owns, anything... I'm appealing to--Does he know that one of my witnesses was abducted? Where is he?Irka won't testify now. It's completely understandable. She's way too scared. I just... I don't know what to do with her. The GDA won't take her and her traffickers will find her if she's in this city.These girls are dragged into this country like cattle and then the system that's supposed to help them spits them right back out. It barely recognizes sex trafficking as a problem even though it's a fucking epidemic, and everyone knows it. Are we supposed to wait around for that to change?Really? You think it's okay?Is there a specific way of addressing the High Commissioner of the Mission?Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. Ah, I'll have a wine please.Oh I... I just needed some air.She's very vulnerable to re-trafficking. Internationals got her in this situation. We owe her the chance to get out.I also think the American embassy should be aware of some of the problems we're having with our officers.I've sent an APB out to all police stations and UN field offices... But I'm pushing ahead with the other girls in Milena's shelter. I'm creating a photo- line-up using the UN ID database, so they can identify all internationals involved. We've got to make them accountable.I have a favour to ask.You have access to all transport vehicle checkouts, right?Can you see how often Fred Murray has checked out raid vehicles?What? Why didn't anyone tell me. Is he being disciplined because of my--You've seen what they're doing.A bit.Excuse me?Are you suggesting I take time off. Or are you telling me?Consolidate my leave... A fucking vacation?Who are these people? And why does Dyncorp, a company that sends American peacekeepers, have it's corporate headquarters in England?Of course I want to see my kids, of course. But... not like this. Not by being sent home like some hysterical woman... My God, it wasn't that easy to up and leave them. If I go home like this... It's like coming here, this whole thing was a... mistake. TWB 70.Really? I'm losing witnesses, suspects... It's one step forward, two steps back...No, seriously. I'm just a cop from Nebraska. What do I know?Jesus.You've given every officer time to create an alibi.They are SLAVES. By any American or International law. TWB 74....you know they're not baseless.Rick publicly outed me, jeopardizing those girls. I have to go over his head. But I... I never thought I'd have to go into Internal Affairs. The guys back home would never understand this.Yeah? And how long do you plan on being around, because the last two guys who said that aren't here.It's just I waited so long you know. I want my kids to know I did something, to be proud.No. Your kids are proud. You go on this mission and you're a big hero. I go and I'm a bad mother... I can't believe I'm gonna disappoint them again.It's, I need to speak in-camera with a senior IA official. I don't have a name, but--I did a photo ID line-up with victims who testified to international patronizing of brothels, as well as complicity in trafficking itself.All the cases I filed to my superiors have come back, shut down. Some of them were marked as referred to IA.Really?Hello?... Sorry, who is this?... Just one second...Can I get your name? Hello? Hello?That was you today, in IA?What's this?I don't understand.Why?.. There has to be some sort of an international court or body that can turn this around--I don't want a scandal. I just want--Dyncorp's Headquarters are in England--This is... I can't believe your timing...I'm not even sure I'm staying.These guys... Jones is a sexual offender. Dyncorp hired him... These private militaries are a sham. There's no way around them.I have children, I have to think about them... TWB 82.How'd you--No. He'll walk. We have no proof they were trafficked. Let me talk to them. See what else they know.I have no options right now. The GDA is more secure than Milena's shelter... Can they stay before you do the paperwork?And you're saying these soldiers brought you into Bosnia. Through the border? You're sure?They had uniforms? Like mine?Then you have conspiracy to traffick. And I can take it to Bill Hynes. That's enough to do a raid that will stick.That's it. Conspiracy to traffick.We arrest the buyer first. The bar-owner. The border log corroborates the victims' testimony. Once he's in custody, we raid his place and get those girls out. TWB 89.The raid has to be small. No-one knows the bar till we're on our way.That's why I came straight to you. They were brought across the border by our guys. I need two back-up security vans for a raid, with well-trained--This is real evidence. And that's just a drop in the ocean. I have hundreds of files. Photos, corroborated statements. We can build this case and get the perpetrators out of the mission--These girls--You know as well as I do, those girls aren't a product of the war. TWB 90.They're a product of the peace. For the peace-keepers.Try and get him outside first, then arrest him. Once you've got him outta there we'll go in. I want the girls to know they're safe.You do not have to be afraid of Ivan Bladzic. He cannot hurt you now. TWB 92.We want to get you out of here safely. That is my absolute priority.Get those blankets out of the vans. Let's get these girls out.You just have to tell me you want to go. That you do not work here voluntarily. And we will get you to safety.You can leave with me this second. All of you can. But I need you to say it.You know me.You can all leave with me! Let's go.Who the fuck are you? What have you done? What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? You fuck!They're supposed to TRUST US!I know this girl. I know her. We can't leave them here. We're supposed to--Erin?... No... Nothing's wrong. I just needed to... I needed to say I'm sorry... I'm sorry if you ever felt I wasn't there for you, but... I love you.I am a police officer obligated to report crimes. I have taken statements from women describing their physical, psychological, and emotional torture......On arriving in Bosnia these women are sold, and forced to provide sexual services......Their clientele consists of SFOR, IPTF, local police, and International employees. Worse, they have become involved in the trade itself....It is time each and every one of you realize this is a serious organized crime, with enormous profits.You are peace keepers who came to protect the innocent but now prey upon them in the worst ways possible...It is time to face the truth of what is happening. We can right our wrongs, and move forward, ashamed, but accountable and transparent...We may be accused of thinking with our hearts instead of our heads, but we will have our integrity.An email I wrote.You can't--No.He's powdering my car.So you know how we talked about living together..? It may be a bit sooner than we planned.They tell me... people disappear. They bug my house. I mean, I'm sitting here, worried there's a bomb in my car--This isn't just my career, it's my life. I don't know if I'm ready to be a scapegoat.Whose?What do I do? TWB 105.If you could just go into my office, I'll give you a key to the cabinets...You don't have anything smaller? TWB 106.Yes, this is Kathy Bolkovac and--OK. CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?THIS IS KATHRYN BOLKOVAC. I WANTED TO DISCUSS MY TERMINATION--OK. IT'S JUST THAT I WAS TOLD YOU MET WITH MR. HYNES ABOUT ME.Timesheet Violations? They are firing me for time sheet violations!!!I'm not going anywhere. Not without an investigation. Madeleine Rees is--Can you repeat that?So you're saying the State Department is instructing Dyncorp to fire me.Please... can I just go in for one minute, get my personal belongings.I have everything you need. When I arrive in Amsterdam safely, I will go on record.I think that Mr. Hynes knows this is a false statement.I watched that... Yes.Yes I would. No doubt about it... I would definitely do it again.

I think she has Olympic ambitions.The immunity problem.It could work. If you make certain that in their testimony they mention every sordid detail of IPTF involvement--They're gonna answer for this.It's not your fault.Maybe it's time for a little diplomacy... Do you have a nice frock?I call him Bill.Mrs. Ambassador! How do we do?I hope you don't mind, I've brought along a friend. This is Kathy Bolkovac.Actually, I had a different one in mind.Behind every good man...We want to repatriate Irka to the United States and find her a foster family. I was hoping you could use your influence--Your help with Irka's case can really raise awareness in the Mission around the issue of trafficking.The young woman, who shall remain anonymous, arrived in Bosnia as a victim of sex trafficking and has survived horrific abuse. TWB 66.Ordinarily she would be repatriated to her country of origin. But because she is an orphan, she finds herself without a home. I'm pleased to announce that we have found a foster family in the United States. I want to thank Janet Wells for her assistance in making this happen. I believe this can stand as a signal that the International community in Bosnia and beyond is finally ready to recognize the growing epidemic of sex trafficking, a human rights abuse as abhorrent as the war crimes that drew the International Community to intervene in Bosnia in the first place. Thank you.Nothing on Raya?What's this I hear about you leaving?The Dutch Officer rang before he left. C'mon, I want to show you something.After we got Irka repatriated, I had some calls from other private parties that were interested in helping. We've gathered $40,000 so far. I've applied for matching funds, so that... we can completely rebuild this shelter.Things are changing Kathy.The State Department money monster. Ironic, isn't it? That the very people whose money we need to fund a shelter to protect these girls, are the exact people they need protecting from.Right. It is a core function of the Gender Office.About the memo--Bullshit. You can't just fire her without cause. You need a reason that would stand up in court!She is not burned out, she's being burned! TWB 101.Then start running it with some integrity! It's your people perpetrating crimes against humanity!This is coming from Washington?It's bollocks. Absolute and total. You have signed a contract with Dyncorp Aerospace Operations U.K... And there is no provision under English law for summary dismissal without due process or an investigation.But there was something else Bill said... If this is coming from above... Kathy,you need to prove that they are dismissing you because you were uncovering wide- spread corruption within this mission. If you can prove that this is indeed coming from Washington, that the State Department is instructing Dyncorp to fire you. Then we're talking about a conspiracy.We can fight this.That's exactly what you are.I don't know what to say to that. Think about this. Let me know what you want to do. I'll support you either way.Hand in an appeal. Keep reporting to work. Watch how they respond. Build your case... And catch them in their lies.Try me...
