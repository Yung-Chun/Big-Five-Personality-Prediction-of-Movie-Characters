{"Robin-Hood-Prince-of-Thieves": {"ROBIN": {"raw_line": "No!... I took the bread.They're not interested in truth. You are too weak, Peter. You would not live through it. The Interrogator stares into Robin's eyes.And this is English courage. He hurls his holders aside. Swings upward, driving his fast into the executioner's throat. Grabs the sword. Slash. His thongs melt like butter. A jailer leaps at him. Steaming, the scimitar slices into the man's chest. Despite his bindings, Peter wrestles the Interrogator. Knife pressed to his throat, Peter is forced against the furnace. At the last second, he flips the man into the fire. Screaming.You speak English?What I would give for an English sword. This is a pruning hook. A guard swings at him with a giant axe. Robin slashes... shears the axe handle in two.Hmm! Not bad. He runs the man through. Peter loses his sword. His opponent moves in for the kill... Peter grabs tongs from the fire and smolders his opponent with a backhand. Commotion outside. RAISED VOICES and RUNNING FEET.Why should we trust you?He makes a point. The door bursts open. More guards rush in.A good point. He slashes the man free.Whatever blood is in his veins, he does not deserve to die here.Five years I've waited for the smell of free air. That makes a man fast. Guards drop down from above, carrying torches. Blocking the way.Amen, brother. A bloodcurdling scream. A pursuing guard tumbles down the sewer chute. The three men press themselves against the wall. The man hurtles by... is impaled on the spikes. A draft of fresh air from the roof of the tunnel. Using the spiked guard as a ladder, Robin climbs. Removes a grating.God willing, we may now be safe.Come, Peter. We must hurry. Raising his sword, Peter faces the oncoming soldiers.Hold on to my shoulder.I swear it. Summoning hidden resources of strength, Peter charges at the oncoming soldiers, brandishing his sword.Farewell, friend. God speed you on your way.I go to England.England? Why?Go your own way. I relieve you of your obligation.And if I don't want you?Robin of Locksley. You know a short route to England, Aslan? CUT TO:Home. Thank you, Lord. Aslan steps from the boat, sniffing the air. The French sailors keep their distance from him. Robin takes his hand.My friend, you have escorted me home. I beg you to free yourself of your vow. Return with the boat. I know how heavy your heart must be, this far from your family and native land...I thought you'd say that. He nods to the sailor, who swings the club down. The Saracen sidesteps, grabs the man's arm and flips him into the surf. He turns a cold stare on Robin.Come, Aslan. By nightfall we will celebrate your honor when we dine with my father.Why must you walk in back of me?Our races have fought for a hundred years to prove that point.For an 'infidel' you have uncommon clarity of thinking. Yet you refuse to tell me about your home and family.You speak my language. You have the diplomacy and honor code of a nobleman. I ask again, why were you to be executed? The Saracen maintains a moody silence.So, I must continue with my guesswork. You are highborn? Probably... You fell from favor... Clearly... Why? You broke the law? You were a rival for power? ... A woman?By the Lord, that's it! Aslan is silent, but Robin knows he's right.They say there are Arab women of such beauty that they can possess a man's mind, that he would be willing to die for them. Is that not so? Ignoring him, the Saracen stops. Examines the darkening sky.Your people must marry women chosen for them by others, right? No reply. Aslan unfolds a prayer rug.Who is she? The Mullah's daughter? ... Another man's wife?... That's it!You dog! You painted old dog! What is her name?Her name?Her name?Ah, Jasmina! Is she beautiful?That way. Aslan throws his rug on the ground. Kneels.I would know blindfolded. I'm five miles from home... Was she worth it?Hold!... I am curious as to what manner of creature is so fearsome that it takes six men to attack it. Shrouded in his pilgrim's hooded cloak, he approaches them.Have we treed the devil himself? Let me see... Ah ha! A small boy. A truly dangerous animal.Wrong. This is my land, and my tree. Therefore, whatever is in it also belongs to me.The man who strikes that tree dies. He glances nervously at Aslan, who's still at his prayers. The men stop in mid-swing. More surprised than scared. Gisborne gestures to the largest of them.Perhaps we could discuss this.Aslan! It's time to redeem that vow.Aslan, get off your damn knees! I have four of them cornered. The Saracen remains head down. Or did we see him steal a glance? Gisborne signals his men to attack. A wave of flashing steel.I hope there's enough of me to satisfy you all. Backed up to a tree, he grabs a branch and kicks out. Two men fly back. He lunges at a third. His sword strikes flesh. Robin sidesteps and hurls the fourth onto a sharp tree stump. Gisborne thrusts. Robin reacts too slowly. Blood flows from his arm. His sword falls.Aslan!! Gisborne is on him, sword pressed to his back. Robin freezes.On your knees, Gisborne. Pray. He obeys. Robin raises his sword.Now get off my land. And tell your cousin the Sheriff what happens to his scum when they pick on my people. Gisborne takes off, colliding with Aslan as he folds his rug. Reacts in shock at the sight of the strange Arab. Keeps running.You worthless savage! You travel ten thousand miles to save my life, then leave me to be butchered.Which does not include prayer times, meal times, or any time I'm outnumbered six to one!!Barely. Aslan examines Robin's wound. Dismissive.After six years of the stench of death, I have no stomach for needless blood on my hands. Wulf climbs cautiously from the tree.Have no fear, boy. The boy nervously eyes Robin and the Saracen, fingering a crucifix around his neck. Runs off into the woods.Ha! It was you he was scared of. Aslan's humor is infectious. Robin's anger relents.Come, my strange friend. Beyond that hill lies the prettiest little castle in all Christendom. Warm hearths, hot food, real beds.With feather pillows. Warm and soft like Jasmina's embrace.Father! Hello! His VOICE ECHOES around the fallen battlements. Aslan places a hand on his shoulder and points... Suspended high on a tower wall is a decaying human corpse.Noooooo! A paroxysm of rage and grief. He smashes furniture. Slams his fists relentlessly into the wall. Pained, Aslan looks on.I should have been here. Spent, he leans against the wall. In the silence, they hear an eerie TAPPING. Robin draws his sword... A hunched, old man emerges, walking with the aid of a staff ... Duncan.Damn you, Duncan. Why didn't you cut him down?You left my father to hang like a common thief, carrion for the crows.What has happened?Did they have witnesses?Did you believe the charges?Who did this to you, Duncan?Our last words in this world were spoken in anger. He called the Crusades a foolish quest, said it was vanity to force other men to our religion. He was right. Please forgive me, Father.I failed him. I should have been here at his side.Leave me.Leave me.I swear by my own blood. I will not rest until I have restored my father's name. ... Or until I am dead.We make a fine army, do we not, Duncan? A blind man, an Arab, and a fool.This is summer.Why, pray?You despair too soon, Aslan. We shall find food and shelter here among friends.Peter's home. It is nearly seven years since we left here together.Open up!Tell the mistress of the house that Robin of Locksley is at her door.Aagh! He shouts through the hatch, over his bruised fingers.Is the child Marian at home?I am Robin of Locksley.I may meet my maker soon from lack of sustenance. But for now I am real enough.By heaven, am I to dance next? Who are you?Then show yourself, child. For we knew each other well.You know I am not one of them. Besides, I am sworn to protect you.Allow that years of war and prison may change a man. Step forward, Marian, so I may see how you have changed.Er... the years have been kind.Wait, Marian! ...ouch!You are truly courageous against an unarmed man. The figure gestures towards the door. Robin sidesteps. Slams an elbow. The sword drops. Slides across the floor. Robin moves for it, but the man intercepts, drawing a dagger. Robin darts to the wall. Rips off an antlered deer head. Defends himself as the attacker slashes at the horns.Marian. CUT TO:We were together five terrible years in a Saracen prison.Marian, I'm sorry.On my return, I found my father dead. The Sheriff denounced him as a Druid and took our lands.Why do you not join your mother in London? You would be safer there.The you must allow me to be your guardian.Marian, I don't want to replace him.I killed some of the Sheriff's men. I fear I have placed you in danger.I'm not leaving. Marian ices him with a glare. Aslan reappears, with two bareback horses. Soldiers appear on the crest, led by Gisborne... With a mischievous grin, Marian runs to the soldiers.Damn the girl! Aslan, can you ride? In answer, Aslan grins. Leaps onto a horse. With a single swift move he hoists Duncan up behind him and digs in his heels. The mare leaps forward, and over the estate wall.He can ride. He heads his horse at the wall. It stumbles. Barely clears it. Stones fly. Robin struggles to hold on. Marian stands directly in Gisborne's path.Damn you, animal! Aslan shouts from the far bank.Of course I've had a woman! Come on, pretty one. He pats the horse soothingly. The animal edges forward.I know! I know! The soldiers reload. Robin urges the horse at the steep drop.Easy, easy. Another wave of crossbow bolts. Robin launches the frightened animal into space. Hooves flail... touch down. Scramble up the other bank. Robin enthusiastically pats the horse's neck.I love you! The first two pursuers misjudge their leaps. Their mounts land sprawling in the riverbed.What is your pleasure, Gisborne?You survived one meeting. Our next will be your last.That's a lie!We have lost them. I'll lame this mare if I ask her to go any farther. He gently extracts the shaft from his horse. Aslan opens his pouch. Pulls out two shiny clear pebbles and a square leather hide. Rolls the pebbles into the tube and holds it to his eye. A primitive telescope. Robin watches, curious.Is this Arab magic?God knows!We can lose them in the forest.Either we take our chances with the ghosts, or become ghosts ourselves. He remounts. They race into the trees. Gisborne's men thunder up,... slowing as they enter the forest. Peering around them in trepidation, they slowly rein in. Robin looks back.They're not following.Be quiet! Listen. WIND GUSTS the trees in angry waves. Emits deathly SHRIEKS. The HORSES WHINNEY. Unnerved, Aslan smites around him with his scimitar. Wheels at the sounds, striking only air.Behind you! Aslan slashes out, futilely.No, there! And there! Aslan flails. Robin cracks up.Here are your ghosts, Duncan. A child's toy put to good use. You scare easily, my painted Saladin. His laughter is broken by a piercing YELL. A red- jacketed figure swings down out of a tree on a rope. Catapults him to the ground. The bushes are instantly alive. Shaggy, wild-eyed men, armed with cudgels, scythes and hayforks. Twelfth- century Hell's Angels. The red-jacketed young turk, WILL SCARLET, leaps around Robin.Aslan! Aslan makes no move to intervene.I beg of no man. Which of you scum has guts enough to face me man to man?Er... Robin... He pauses, checking the faces of the angry peasants....Hood. Robin Hood. Who are you?Bestman? You lead this rabble?Tax? For what?I will pay no tax. Besides, I have nothing but my cloak and my sword.That is sacred to me.You will have to fight me for it.This man is your father? Tell him how I saved your hide from the Sheriff's soldiers. That deserves some gratitude, I believe. He reaches for the medallion. John pulls it away.Aslan!Son of an Arab whore! Once again your assistance was invaluable.That rabble?They have a leader. A very large one.Allah has taken your brains.You, too? You expect me to fight that behemoth?This is my bridge. No one crosses without paying tax.If you wish to cross, it will cost you a gold medallion.You don't have the courage to face me again, John Little? Or should I call you 'Little John'? John grabs a hefty, gnarled staff. Strides to the bridge.Do you yield?Do you yield?Good. Now put your feet down. John struggles, then his feet hit bottom... The water only reaches his chest.Pay me the tax. A tense pause while all wait for Little's reaction.A fine brew, Little John. He spits black objects from his mouth. Dead bees. John grins.You owe me nothing, Wulf. I am glad I chanced by in time to help.Tell me about your men, John. John points to a short fellow with the build of a tree trunk.How do you come by the name, Bull?Because you are short?No, Bull. Save it for the ladies. Drunken laughter. Robin turns to the next man at the fireside.Your name, friend? The man's bald pate blushes scarlet as he tries to respond, but he stutters too badly to get out a comprehensible word.Hold! Hal, you have the face and hands of a farmer. I wager you are a strong and honest man, and I'd be glad to have you at my side in a fight. The next man who makes light of you will have to answer to me. There is murmuring around the group, but no one elects to try it.How is it there are so many of you in hiding?How do you fare?While the Sheriff steals your land and your families starve?Your ghosts will only keep his men at bay so long, my friend. Soon the Sheriff will hunt you down and hang you. You must fight back.We must organize. Win by guile.No. To lead you.There are many here who knew my father to be a kind and generous man. I doubt that in their hearts they believe him capable of such a horror. Murmurs of agreement from around the fire. Robin turns to Will.What is your name, friend?He is right to distrust me. I am a rich man's son. I have done no honest labor. But today I am as poor as any of you. Nottingham has stolen all that I own. And when I killed Gisborne's men, I, too, became an outlaw.We can win. And I believe we will.English dogs. They can learn.Too much mead, old friend. What day is it?Good. Do they still give alms to the poor at the mass?Then I must ask you a favor. EXT. ROAD TO NOTTINGHAM - DAYPardon my blindness, sir. I'm always falling down.Alms for a blind man. For one who cannot see your beauty.So you care for my safety?Under the Sheriff's law, that's a badge of pride.How much?Is that all? I have not annoyed him enough. Soon he will offer ten thousand.How do you know?What is he planning?If you need me, I will be with the woodsmen. Send for me as 'Robin Hood.'What?Care to join me? With a grin, he slips into the crowd as Nottingham arrives.A hundred crowns, Sheriff? You insult me. Nottingham starts to struggle. Robin draws blood.Remember young Robin of Locksley, Sheriff? Meet Robin Hood. Your nemesis. Your avenging angel.If I kill you, I will hang happy.I want to give you a chance. A chance you do not deserve. A chance to right your wrongs.From this day forward you will cease to tax my people. You will renounce the charges against my father, and you will return his lands to me.Because for every harm you do, I swear by God I shall visit on you threefold in return.I am here with a blade at your throat. As long as I live, you will always know that I could be here again. A YELL from across the church. Gisborne has spotted them. Robin digs the knife a little deeper.Your answer?Then it will begin.. Gisborne yells orders. Robin hurls Nottingham against the wall.A personal loan from the Sheriff.How so? You have not raised a finger to protect me.It was my choice to do this alone.Aslan, if I didn't know better, I would swear you were worried about me.Then we shall take from him and his rich friends.Will, do you think the Sheriff will give everything back after I am gone?Alright, Will. You can take me in on one condition. You must fight me. You may use the Sheriff's horse and arm yourself as you please. I will fight on foot. Unarmed.If you lose, you will accept me as your leader. If you win, you may take me in. Dead or alive.I am grateful for your concern, friends, but I have to prove to them it is possible to overcome unequal odds. I am ready, Will. Will bends, as if checking the horse's legs. Secretly grabs a handful of sand. Swings into the saddle and digs in his heels. Closing in, Will flings the sand in Robin's eyes. Robin clutches his hands to his face, blinded. Will spins back to the attack. His sword slashes. Reacting to the sound, Robin rolls aside. The men cheer like a big fight crowd.Come on, you little piss pot. Do your worst! Will grabs a spear from a bystander. Robin stands his ground. Will lunges, Robin sidesteps.The horse is smarter than you are, Will. Some of the men laugh. Will is incensed. Robin ducks and weaves, easily evading Will's repeated charges. Robin ducks right under the horse's belly.Here, Will! You aim like a girl, Will! Will stabs wildly, more and more frustrated. Laughter spreads, as Robin plays hide and seek around the horse's legs. Grabbing the end of the spear, he clowns a tug of war. Enraged, Will strains and tries to kick Robin away. Suddenly, Robin lets go. Unbalanced, Will flies back- wards off his mount. Robin snatches the spear and raises it over his fallen adversary. The crowd falls silent. Robin strikes. The point quivers in the ground below Will's crotch. Will wriggles in terror. Impaled, his pants rip open.Thank the Lord you are not endowed like Bull.Nottingham has taken from us everything we own. Now we are going to start taking from him.We are going to tax him. DISSOLVE TO:How many?Twenty? They usually have five. He grabs the telescope.Er, about ten. Why scare them? They can't count anyway.Let's go. Together they run down the hill, keeping low. Gisborne eyes the forest. The beer cart is steered by a fat red-faced FRIAR, raucously singing hymns and quaffing from a jug, which he repeatedly dips into one of the barrels. ARROWS WHISTLE in. The Friar yells and drops his jug. A soldier is hit. At the forest edge, four woodsmen reload their longbows. Dressed in green, their faces camouflaged. The mounted soldiers charge them. The woodsmen run into the trees. As the horsemen close in, the runners leap into a trench. Lift up matted screens of brush and grass. It's as if they disappeared. The soldiers slash wildly at the thick screens. More arrows fly. More soldiers fall. The others spin in confusion, trying to discern the enemy. More woods- men break from cover. Run down a narrow path. Gisborne urges his men to pursue. They ride in single file, beating their way through the tangled branches.Surrender your weapons. I give you my word you shall go free. In answer, a swordblade jabs up through the roof, near his feet.Ah, I feared as much. He signals to Aslan, who steers the tax wagon into the river. Water floods in through the slits. Inside, panic. Drowning rats. The bowmen scramble out. What they see stops them dead. Both banks are men in green, longbows aimed directly at them. CUT TO:This treasure had a purpose. We must find out what. He turns at the sound of a brawl from the Friar's cart. The Friar is at the bottom of a struggling heap of bodies.Get off him. He's a man of the cloth. Robin drags the men off. The Friar clambers to his feet. Around him are strewn battered and winded woodsmen.It appears to me, Reverend Friar, that many of the libations have found their way into your own esteemed person. Ignoring him, the Friar mounts the cart.A moment, my reverend friend. You travel with poor company when you travel with Nottingham's soldiers.My men are thirsty and have much to celebrate.Surely the Lord has the charity to spare a few barrels to good Christian men. The Friar relents, loosening his grip on the reins.You leave when I say. Scrambling to his feet, the Friar glances skyward.Never! Whoomf!Yield yourself! He dives onto the Friar and hammers his head into the ground.Yield to Robin Hood. Tuck holds up a hand in surrender. Robin eases off.Well, Friar Tuck. We have need of an honest man of God, to minister to these men and their families. What do you say?Giddyup, Friar.What do you say now, Tuck? Here are the meek of the earth. Tuck surveys the hopeful, hungry faces. The little hamlet of half-built huts. He folds his hands in a moment of prayer.You will not regret it.Buy yourself a new son, Stephen.I believe you. But this Arab here, he's got it into his barbarian brain that you know a whole lot more than nothing.And when he gets like this, he's very hard to reason with. With a hair-raising war cry, Aslan leaps INTO VIEW. Stripped to the waist, brandishing his scimitar. The Captain tries to back away. Robin tries to restrain Aslan, is hurled aside. Snarling, drooling at the mouth, Aslan explores the Captain's body with his hands. A butcher checking meat.I strongly advise you to talk. He hasn't eaten in weeks.You.No, Aslan... not this one, Aslan. ... How about this other one?... Fatter, yes... more meat. The other soldier, who definitely has more flesh on the bone, is struck dumb with horror, as Aslan turns his attention to him. With one swing of his sword, Aslan slices through the man's ropes. Drags him to his feet. Little John runs over.I cannot stop him, John. Besides, if they will not tell what they know, then they must pay the price.Well, roughly, he says that he doesn't care for the way your friend tastes, and he wants you.Thanks to our cannibal friend. Aslan repeats his wildman act, munching on a chunk of venison.To hire mercenaries. The Celts are savage tribesmen, trained to kill from birth.Since he also has every Smith in the country working in his castle, we can assume he is planning a little war.Good morning, Lady Marian. In response, she starts pelting him with stones.Ah well... er, let me finish this bath you wished me to take. Then I'll explain.If you will be patient, I could spare your propriety by...As you wish.Nottingham robs the poor. We rob Nottingham and give back to the poor.Somebody has to take a stand.Nottingham was sending this gold to buy reinforcements from the Celtic tribesmen. We need to warn King Richard.The King is not in England to be challenged, is he? While he is away, he may lose his country. You are Richard's cousin. You can get word to him. He would believe you.I am sending Duncan with you. Give him some warm food and a real bed. I grow tired of his bellyaching.Don't tell him I told you, but he may be useful to you. There is no one to whom I would rather entrust your safety.Will you send word to the King?We have to be ready to move camp at any time. The only way we can be attacked is from the Nottingham Road. We hide lookouts in the trees, here and here. If they see soldiers, they shoot warning arrows. Whistles by day, fire by night. Wulf runs up to Little John in panic.The good Friar has done all he can. I suggest you let the Arab try. If I am wrong, and they die, then you may take my life.What are you going to do?The knife?Horses? By the Lord, what are her chances?Now you tell me! Wulf runs back in. Aslan holds up a piece of wood.Is she gone?What did you say? Aslan holds up a bloody struggling infant.The dancing demon! Good morning.They need help.Are you sure it was a Druid mask? Damn them to hell! They must have Marian. Do you know where they meet?No! You stay here, dammit! I will go alone.Then be my friend. There are women and children here in greater need of your courage.Marian!Why, Marian?I love you.Where is Marian?Marian? Aslan runs to the back of the cave, searching. Wulf is crouched beside Bull, who murmurs his dying words.You have fulfilled your vow. Now you can leave.You ignored my request.Because of you, another good man is dead.To hell with your damn vow.The forest! Ride!Wulf, stay here. I need your horse. He climbs onto Wulf's horse, steers it right at the heart of the enemy... Aslan blocks his way, grabbing his reins.What are you doing? Out of my way!Out of my way, damn you!You were an honor to your countrymen today, Aslan. You fought better than twenty English knights.Well, the war is over. He stares across the desolate clearing.There is too much blood on my hands.My pride brought us to this.I gave them nothing but false hope. Tomorrow we will disperse. These people can move south and start over. You must go home and win your Jasmina.I am no longer your responsibility.Damn you, Arab. I want you out of my life. Can't you understand that? Go home. Go back to your own kind. Aslan stares at him, then turns away. Not the time for argument. Robin fingers his father's medallion... rips it from his neck.Damn you, too, Father. You reared a coward and a fool. He hurls the medallion... it catches on a low-hanging branch. CUT TO:Will! I thought you were taken.How did you escape?And will you? Before Will can answer, Little John runs up. Grabs Will's throat.John, wait. Let us hear what he has to say.A traitor sneaks in and out under cover of darkness. Will walked in and announced himself.Let him speak.You were to use this news to get close to me, and then kill me? Right, Will?What is your intention, Will?How so?You present quite a choice. What would you have me do, Will?And if I stay, will you all stay with me? Robin checks the other faces.There's your answer, Will. We finish it.Will it work? Aslan throws a handful of powder into the firel A fire- ball rips ten feet in the air... Tuck falls on his ass in terror.You are truly a wizard.We have no armored knights, no glorious banners. But I am honored to be going to battle in this company. Today we fight not just for the lives of our friends, but to save all England. A moment of tension before Will takes the proferred hand.We may be only six men, but...Fanny, show me the exact location of the scaffold. Little John double-takes.Friends! We must raise the gate.Light all the barrels, Tuck.Jump! Tuck jumps. Robin steers the wagon at the gate. At the last second, he slashes the reins and leaps onto the horse's back... The BARRELS EXPLODE! The portcullis is blown to kingdom come. Out of the smoke, Robin rides the old nag like a charger. Leads his cheering, ragged fighters through the open gate.Where is she? Where is Lady Marian?Ah! There is my answer. He hurls the man aside... The armed guards charge him.Marian, run! It's me, Robin. Run! Marian remains immobile. Mortianna moves to her side. Robin is struck in the thigh. Like a vulture, the Sheriff waits. Tiring, blood pouring from his leg, Robin prepares to fight him.I warned you, I would find you no matter what.Watch out! Aslan spins... too late. Screeching, Mortianna drives the spear into Aslan's side. He cries out and slides to the floor. Nottingham uses Robin's distraction to regain his sword. Back on the defensive, Robin tries to evade the blows. Mortianna drags Marian out onto a balcony. Robin cannot pursue. In acute pain, Aslan struggles to his feet. Grasping the spear where it enters his side, he pulls with all his strength. The Bishop, concealed dagger in hand, approaches Tuck.This is for my father.I'm your sworn protector. Any way I see fit.I think she's feeling better. Marian looks about her... the chaotic aftermath of battle. Reality gradually sinks in. She folds against Robin's chest. Little John arrives, his huge arms enfolding Wulf and Fanny.It will mend. He spots a group kneeling beside the fallen body of Aslan. His smile fades. He runs over. Cradles Aslan's head.Aslan, my friend.Here, Tuck. Look after him. You deserve each other. Robin stands, Marian joins him. Around them cheering grows, till the whole crowd is in unison.Who would dare refuse his king's request?We are deeply honored by Your Majesty's presence.", "clean_line": "took bread interested truth

Locksley is surrounded. One by one the men reveal their faces. Locksley backs up in shock, recognizing them.One day all England will worship with us.Who bade you cover up? He smashes his fist into his chair. She timidly uncovers.Cousin, I trust you justify your intrusion with news of profound value. His attention is riveted on a dark niche in the corner of the courtyard. UNEARTHLY SOUNDS emanate from the black- ness.His name?Ha! The prodigal son returns. He is a whelp. This girl could best him.Your men were probably drunk. Yet you survived, cousin? Heavy scorn. The sheriff pats Gisborne's hand like a child's. The voice from the darkness becomes a loud CHANT. A wrinkled, monkey-like figure dances INTO VIEW, wearing a necklace of human fingers. You might think she was a hundred years old, if not for her incredible agility. MORTIANNA.Quiet! The crone's fingers dart into a bag. Emerge with a writhing, SQUEALING mass... a PIGLET. A knife flashes. Blood spurts into an ornate, sacred platter. The girl flinches in horror. Mortianna shakes the con- tents of a pouch across the bloody dish. Carved bone dice -- Runes. She rattles the platter. The rune symbols dance in trails of blood. Eyes vacant, mouth frothing, she hisses out her incoherent visions. Nottingham follows her every move. A connoisseur.What do you see?London?Move the capitol to Nottingham? Excellent. How?Put someone on the throne and rule through him? Who?Ally with royal blood. What else do you see?Whose?And victory?Whose?What is wrong?Cousin. Prove to Locksley that your survival was his last mistake.Kill them both. He continues to stroke her. Her trembling subsides.You have done well, Mortianna. Exceedingly well. No one shall harm you, I swear it. Mortianna reaches out bloodied fingers towards the young girl, who shrinks away. Nottingham gently takes the girl's hand.Now, my child, Mortianna's kisses will seem soft, like an angel's. Take her. You have earned her. Mortianna grabs the terrified girl's wrist. Drags her away.Fear not for my sanity, Guy. For in madness, there is great power.You shine like the sun, my lady. He raises her hand, as he did the girl's in the castle. Kisses it.You have been meeting with young Robin of Locksley. My cousin tells me the knave deprived you of some horses.I deeply regret it, and I promise you he will be brought to justice. For subjecting you to such treatment, I will hang him from the walls with his own entrails. That gleam of insanity. Robin watches from a distance.My dear, a woman of your refinement is not safe living alone. If you would consent to bring your household within the city walls, I could give your needs my most personal attention.Alas, the King has many enemies both abroad and at home. I fear for his safe return.If you kill me, you will hang.What do you want?I'm listening.Why should I?Empty words.Never, fool.Starve them out. Slaughter their livestock. I want to see Locksley's own people fighting each other to bring him to us.Spanish steel, cousin. So much stronger than our native blades. Any losses?Yet again you are the sole survivor, cousin? Interesting. And the gold?Robin Hood?Robin Hood. He places a hand reassuringly on his cousin's shoulder.Cousin, we must be strong. We cannot allow this outlaw to make fools of us. Without warning, he drives the blade into Gisborne's belly.And I cannot allow a lieutenant to fail me. It is indeed fine steel.How can we control all England if we cannot control our own county? The people are turning him into a hero.Then we will be more cunning. I must be rid of him. We may not be able to intercept his next warning to the King. Sounds of COMMOTION outside. The door swings open. Framed in the doorway is a colossus in black armor. His helmet is the head of a dragon. He slowly raises the visor. Deep tribal scars on his cheeks. Implacable ferocity in his eyes.Welcome, sir. We were discussing how to rid ourselves of those very men. The outlaws who band with Robin Hood.This rat Hood has hidden out in the forest. He resists all our assaults with traps and devices, while he robs us blind. We must bring him out and destroy him. The rat has scurried into the shelter of the model trees. The Chieftain watches impassively, then calmly touches the log to the model. The trees ignite... the RAT SQUEALS in terror and runs. The Chieftain cuts off its escape, setting fire to more trees... again... and again. The Sheriff watches the flames, fascinated. DISSOLVE TO:I want prisoners. The Chieftain does not turn his head.Nevertheless, I need prisoners. With only a short flick of his head, the Chieftain spits. Nottingham waves his arm, signalling his own foot sol- diers to advance. The Chieftain raises his sword. Instantly a tumultuous chilling roar from his warriors. They charge forward.Would you prefer pain or death?Torture him. The man is dragged away by guards. The next PRISONER --And you? Pain or death?Torture him... you see, it makes no difference.You will all be tortured. You will all tell me all you know about Robin Hood, and then you will all be hanged. Then we will catch your beloved Robin Hood and do the same to him.Why would I need you?And you can succeed?If you fail, I will personally cut out your lying tongue. He withdraws the blade. Will tries to smile.His friends will.. ... torture him! He turns back to Will. A smile of mock apology.It will look better.How is my bride? Marian smiles as he leans toward her... and spits in his face.Ah... You are overwhelmed with happiness. He slowly wipes off the spittle... and slaps her hard.When we are married, thirty of the northern barons will pledge me their support as king. As you predicted. Mortianna squats on the floor besides a platter of blood. Clasps the dice-like runes.What do you see in the portents? Mortianna rocks on her heels, clutching her taloned hands to her sides. She chants, fingering the bloody stones.Di not give me riddles, woman. We are to be married within hours. How can we be in danger?Tell me how it will result.Confound you, crone. Without my protection, the people would hunt you down, rip out your black heart and burn it.Ah, the turncoat. Did you succeed?Stretch his neck with the others. Hands yank Will to his feet. Dazed, he tries to speak. Disinterested, Nottingham turns away, until he catches...Locksley, here? Where ? Will struggles to get free of his holders.Release him!... Now, where is he?We will find him.Put Hood in my hands, you go free.Damn your worthless hide! Just tell me where he is.You'll get your reward. Where is he? CUT TO:Step down, friar.This man claims you have outlaws concealed in these barrels. Among them the cursed Robin Hood. Tuck glares at Will with unconcealed hatred.Break one open!Here's another message to Robin Hood, written in your blood. He drives his sword repeatedly, insanely, into Will's belly.Lower the portcullis! Now! A guard winds down the giant gate. Nottingham hurls him aside.Too slow, fool! He hacks at the ropes. The gate slices down like a guillotine, pinning soldiers and peasants alike.Seal the entrance. Guard it with your lives. ... Bring the bishop to my chapel.Come! It is time for the union. The guards roughly haul Marian to her feet. She is oblivious.Marry us. When I am declared king, that rabble will not dare go against us.No companions? No army? You rush to your death for the sake of a woman. Lust has turned you into a fool... Recognize this, Locksley? He raises his sword to reveal its handle. A crucifix sculpted into the hilt... Robin's father's sword.Appropriate I should use it to kill you with, don't you think? He lunges. A savage, accomplished swordsman, with fire in his eyes. Exhausted, Robin is driven back, parrying desperately.You should have stayed away, Locksley. Fools like you never learn. A blow slices Robin's arm. His sword flies from his grasp. Nottingham gloats. Two of his men scramble back to their feet. Robin is beat... a war cry! Aslan, followed by Tuck.What can your puny God do for you now? The blade comes whirring down... clang! It's blocked. Robin has the altar's crucifix in his hand. He swings it again, slamming Nottingham across the temple. The Sheriff hits the floor. Robin grabs his father's sword. Raises it two-fisted. Nottingham tries to squirm away.", "clean_line": "unwelcome surprise locksley think locksley surrounded men reveal faces locksley backs shock recognizing day england worship bade cover smashes fist chair timidly uncovers cousin trust justify intrusion news profound value attention riveted dark niche corner courtyard unearthly sounds emanate black ness ha prodigal son returns whelp girl best men probably drunk survived cousin heavy scorn sheriff pats gisborne hand like child voice darkness loud chant wrinkled monkey like figure dances view wearing necklace human fingers think years old incredible agility mortianna quiet crone fingers dart bag emerge writhing squealing mass piglet knife flashes blood spurts ornate sacred platter girl flinches horror mortianna shakes tents pouch bloody dish carved bone dice runes rattles platter rune symbols dance trails blood eyes vacant mouth frothing hisses incoherent visions nottingham follows connoisseur london capitol nottingham excellent throne rule ally royal blood victory wrong cousin prove locksley survival mistake kill continues stroke trembling subsides mortianna exceedingly shall harm swear mortianna reaches bloodied fingers young girl shrinks away nottingham gently takes girl hand child mortianna kisses soft like angel earned mortianna grabs terrified girl wrist drags away fear sanity guy madness great power shine like sun lady raises hand girl castle kisses meeting young robin locksley cousin tells knave deprived horses deeply regret promise brought justice subjecting treatment hang walls entrails gleam insanity robin watches distance dear woman refinement safe living consent bring household city walls needs personal attention alas king enemies abroad home fear safe return kill hang want listening words fool starve slaughter livestock want locksley people fighting bring spanish steel cousin stronger native blades losses sole survivor cousin interesting gold robin hood robin hood places hand reassuringly cousin shoulder cousin strong allow outlaw fools warning drives blade gisborne belly allow lieutenant fail fine steel control england control county people turning hero cunning rid able intercept warning king sounds commotion outside door swings open framed doorway colossus black armor helmet head dragon slowly raises visor deep tribal scars cheeks implacable ferocity eyes welcome sir discussing rid men outlaws band robin hood rat hood hidden forest resists assaults traps devices robs blind bring destroy rat scurried shelter model trees chieftain watches impassively calmly touches log model trees ignite rat squeals terror runs chieftain cuts escape setting trees sheriff watches flames fascinated dissolve want prisoners chieftain turn head need prisoners short flick head chieftain spits nottingham waves arm signalling foot sol diers advance chieftain raises sword instantly tumultuous chilling roar warriors charge forward prefer pain death torture man dragged away guards prisoner pain death torture makes difference tortured tell know robin hood hanged catch beloved robin hood need succeed fail personally cut lying tongue withdraws blade tries smile friends torture turns smile mock apology look better bride marian smiles leans spits face ah overwhelmed happiness slowly wipes spittle slaps hard married thirty northern barons pledge support king predicted mortianna squats floor platter blood clasps dice like runes portents mortianna rocks heels clutching taloned hands sides chants fingering bloody stones di riddles woman married hours danger tell result confound crone protection people hunt rip black heart burn ah turncoat succeed stretch neck hands yank feet dazed tries speak disinterested nottingham turns away catches locksley struggles free holders release hood hands free damn worthless hide tell ll reward cut step friar man claims outlaws concealed barrels cursed robin hood tuck glares unconcealed hatred break open message robin hood written blood drives sword repeatedly insanely belly lower portcullis guard winds giant gate nottingham hurls aside slow fool hacks ropes gate slices like guillotine pinning soldiers peasants alike seal entrance guard lives bring bishop chapel come time union guards roughly haul marian feet oblivious marry declared king rabble dare companions army rush death sake woman lust turned fool recognize locksley raises sword reveal handle crucifix sculpted hilt robin father sword appropriate use kill think lunges savage accomplished swordsman eyes exhausted robin driven parrying desperately stayed away locksley fools like learn blow slices robin arm sword flies grasp nottingham gloats men scramble feet robin beat war aslan followed tuck puny god blade comes whirring clang blocked robin altar crucifix hand swings slamming nottingham temple sheriff hits floor robin grabs father sword raises fisted nottingham tries squirm away"}, "ASLAN": {"raw_line": "Because I love them so dearly, I cannot dishonor them. A sailor creeps up behind Aslan, club in hand.No man controls my destiny. Especially not one who attacks downwind and stinks of garlic. Robin laughs. The Saracen remains intense.If our positions were reversed, I would have done the same. Only I would have succeeded. He smiles broadly. Robin claps him on the shoulder.In your land am I not the infidel? The unbeliever, the instrument of evil?Then I trust it is safer to appear as your slave than as your equal.Those are my burdens.It is close to sunset.Endless clouds. Is there no sun in your cursed country?Which way is East?East?East?!!! Robin folds his arms. A standoff.Damn you!... Jasmina.Which way is East?Are you sure?Worth dying for. Robin stands smiling over him as Aslan begins his prayers... BAYING of HUNTING DOGS... In the distance, the boy Wulf runs toward them, ducks behind a tree and clubs the leading dog with a branch. The other hounds close in... panting with exhaustion, Wulf swings into the branches. A hound savages his leg. The soldiers surround the tree. The boy clambers precariously onto the highest branch... Robin surrep- titiously steals a crossbow from one of the soldiers' horses.I will fulfill my vow when I choose.You whine like a mule. You are still alive.A flesh wound. Why did you let their leader go?The conquering hero returns.With feather pillows?Easy... Look at him. Duncan steps into the moonlight. His face crudely- scarred.Come, friend. He leads the old man away. CUT TO:Like a rock. Duncan offers half the bread to the Saracen.It surprises me that one who curses others so readily has lived so long.Er... no.A fine Saracen name.Lord, yes. But eat in peace. I take no offense. By the prophet! What is the man doing? Robin raises his dagger over his wrist. Aslan runs to him.Wait! Too late. Robin slashes the dagger across his palm. Rain and blood mingle. Streaming onto the grave.A fine, wet army. I have never witnessed a storm of such duration. When does summer come to this land?Then Allah truly is great.No food, no shelter, and weather that would curse the end of the earth. We will all quickly be dead, and I shall be rid of my vow. They approach a stone wall, surrounding a thatched mansion.What is this place?The hospitality here is as warm as the weather.Robin! The old man hears horses. Approaching fast. He runs to a bluff... a column of soldiers snakes up the hillside.Twenty or more. In battle armor.Treat it like a woman. Robin continues to hit his horse and hurl abuse. Closing in, the soldiers unfurl their crossbows. A flight of BOLTS WHISTLES ominously close to Robin. He must jump or die.Have you never had a woman? Gently, man. Soothe it!Softly. With your knees.Come, Robin! He is trying to anger you into a trap. A shaft pierces the flank of Robin's horse. It rears in fright. Robin clings on. Six soldiers, the men Gisborne split off, are climbing the embankment towards him. Robin regains control. Rides right at them. Scatters them, and takes off again. Gisborne yells at his men to follow.No. Arab science. He replaces the tube in his pouch.How did your uneducated kind ever take Jerusalem?Allah protect us from the evil spirits. Duncan clings to his back. Robin points.Cease your mad laughing. I can feel them. Robin reaches into the branches. Pulls out a string of hollowed wooden tubes -- WINDCHIMES. Dozens of such strings on all the trees. He blows over the hollow end. A low chilling MOAN.You seemed more in danger of losing your pride than your life.Your avenging army, my friend.All they need is a leader.Defeat him and they will follow you.With regrets, I decline.On the contrary. I thank you, but my faith prevents me from partaking in such enjoyments.I have led you wrong. This is no army. These men live like dogs.Learn what? To build kennels? He sullenly stalks away. Robin shakes his head. Aslan is right. He rouses Duncan, who is asleep at his side. The old man groans awake, holding his head. Seriously hung-over.You should not have left without me, Englishman.Before I had a choice.A foolish risk. If you had been killed, I would be cursed for eternity for failing to fulfil my pledge.This man has true purpose. He means to kill you.Here they come.Two wagons. Twenty escort.And they call me the barbarian.Perhaps it is time for some heathen persuasion. CUT TO:England.By Allah, leeches! He starts to pull the parasites off. Tuck jumps at him.Blood is like air. If she loses blood, she and the child will die. John is paralyzed with confusion. Tuck appeals to Robin.Fool, both the Bible and the Koran instruct us to preserve life. Tuck raises an arm to strike Aslan. Robin blocks the blow. Aslan gently touches the mother's stomach.Your baby has not turned. It cannot be born without help.If you will allow me, I can help her. It will not be without danger.If you do not listen to me, she will certainly die. And the child, too. Fanny cries out. John looks to Robin, pleading for advice.Bring me a needle, thread, water, a skinning knife, and burning ashes. Wulf runs to obey. John looks horrified. Robin eases him outside, then returns to Aslan's side. They whisper.The child must be taken out by the knife.I have seen it many times with horses.After wasting so much blood... not good.Are you ready?... Bite down on this... Robin, hold her steady. He lifts the red-hot knife from the ashes.It is a boy. The mother revives. Aslan places the child on her breast.Your son, my lady... Robin, hold her skin together while I sew her up. He picks up the needle and thread. Robin's eyes turn to the woman's abdomen... He faints. CUT TO:Alas, I am not permitted...This must be a truly evil potion, to make the soul feel this good. He downs the entire jug in one long draught. Refills it.Come, holy man. A toast to all of Allah's children. The true believers and the fat infidels. Tuck laughs and drinks. Aslan sways and topples at the Friar's feet. Heaves up all over the holy sandals. Tuck looks at Robin.If it was Jehovah who created this brew, he is truly wise. He built the punishment into the crime. An ARROW WHISTLES into a tree. Robin reacts.We will go there.You forget yourself. I am not your servant.Take my eyes, then. He hands Robin his telescope. CUT TO:Behind you! Too late. A sword is driven through Bull's gut. Aslan grabs the attacker by the neck and pile-drives him into the cave wall. The man's SKULL CRACKS against the rocks. Aslan runs to Robin's side, as Wulf hurries to Bull's. Robin is slumped against a rock.They have poisoned you. There are herbs that can alter a man's brain. I know of only one cure. He drops to one knee, slams Robin violently across the other. Slaps him on the back and forces his fingers down his throat.It worked for me this very morning. You will thank me for this later.Your gratitude warms my heart.It is fortunate that I did.He urged me to bring him. He was a brave man and I grieve for him. Praise be to Allah that I do not grieve for you also. Or for my broken vow.I am glad you are feeling better. Ahead of them, Wulf shouts and reins in. He points into the distance. A huge cloud of smoke is darkening the sky.I saved your life. I will not let you give it away for no purpose.Does the witch still have possession of your senses? If we meet up with the survivors we may yet give them some help. And do some damage to the enemy.It was a fiendish mind that planned this campaign.This war is the God of Abraham against the forces of evil.No, friend. It was you who gave these men pride.And you?That is for me to decide.To the end, friend.I have prayed for you, often, my brother. But, let us put prayer aside and help our gods in a more practical manner. I must reveal to you the mysteries of the black powder. Tuck takes a bowl of the powder close to the fire to examine it. Aslan snatches it back... Before Tuck can react, Robin walks up.There is no such thing. But if there was... ... I would surely be one. Robin reaches out and shakes Aslan's hand. A moment of bonding. He moves on to the others, clasping each man's hand as he speaks.You talk too much! He leaps... rams the arrow through the Chieftain's mouthpiece... out the back of his neck. The Chieftain grabs his helmet, trying to rip it off. He topples, his life's blood gushing from both sides of his neck. Aslan plants a foot on the slain warrior.Englishmen! I am not one of you, yet I fight for you. Against a tyrant. Join me now. Join Robin Hood. The onlookers are inspired. Grabbing weapons from fallen soldiers, many join the fray.For Allah!... For Jehovah! For brotherhood!... For justice!Ali akbar!What you fear is not below. He charges at her with the bloody spear. She screams hideously as he thrusts it right through her chest. Her madness is superhuman. With strength beyond all reason, she crawls up the spear's shaft, forcing it further through her body in her effort to get at him. Clutching, screeching, hissing. Her talons groping at his face, Aslan strains to the last ounce of his will and heaves her over the battle- ments. With an ear-splitting shriek, she plummets to the ground.I'm going home the easy way, Robin.I have no strength, Brother Tuck.Please! It hurts when I laugh.My friend, a word of advice... Ride her better than your horse.

Oblivious, he hands the contaminated jug to Aslan.An Englishman's mead not bleedin' good enough for ya?Your bloody loss, mate. He swigs. Passes the jug on to Duncan, who drinks heartily. Wulf cautiously approaches Robin.What is it, boy? Speak up!C'mon, lad, drink! 'Twill put hair on your bloomin' chest. Wulf tries the brew. The impact is instant. He turns green and runs. His father cracks up.This stumpy one 'ere's David o' Doncaster. We calls 'im Bull.That be Hal Brownwell, but the lads call i'm Hal Hiccup. The others make hiccup and belching sounds, and crack up at Hal's embarrassment. Hal strikes out angrily at his tormentors.We're outlaws. Got prices on our 'eads, every man jack. Blasted Sheriff says we owes 'im taxes.We get by, I reckon.What in bloody blazes'd ya have us do?We show as much as a toe outside the forest, they'll slaughter us like bleedin' sheep.'We'? Ya lookin' to join us, matie?Stuff a flippin' cork in it, Will. The man's our guest. Will gets up. Angrily pushes his way out of the group.That there's Will Scarlet. Pay 'im no 'eed. 'E's full o' piss and wind.Ya're full o'bloody wind an' all, mate. This 'ere load o' rubbish agin the Sheriff's bloomin' army? Ya must be bloody jokin'.Ya're a daft bugger, Robin Hood, but ya're a brave 'un, I'll give ya that. Drink up, laddie, cuz tomorrow ya mayn't be so lucky! Tomorrow I shall best ya an' crack that blasted noble head in two. Laughing loudly, he throws back his head for a long draught of mead.Sheriff hasn't left us a bloody pot to piss in.Bollocks, Will. Jus' bugger off, eh? Overpowered, Will relents. With a defiant glance, he skulks away.Ya got us by the short and curlies, Robin Hood. Now let's hear what ya got to bleedin' say.'Ow in bloody blazes are we gonna do that?I'll be buggered.Cain't get a bleedin' squeak outa 'em, Rob.Reckon the Cap'n knows summat, Rob, but stubborn ol' cocker 'e is.No, Robin, no! They be God-fearin' men.Kill 'em aye, but not like this. 'Tain't Christian. Blood-curdling SCREAMS from behind the wagon where Aslan has dragged his victim. The Captain's face pales. Then silence.Sure changed the color of 'is britches, didn't 'e?Gonna laugh my bloody balls off.Aye, the Romans built a bleedin' great wall to keep 'em out.Agin' who?Right m'lad. Let's see how close you can git to that bugger. Wulf takes aim. His arrow slices clear through his father's arrow, splitting it in two. Little John slaps Wulf on the back and beckons everyone over.Take a gander at this 'un, mates. Never seen nuthin' like it in my bloomin' life.Hush, m'lass. Ya'll be fine.Ya're sittin' thar like a fat sow. Help her, man, help her!So be it.marches among the cheering families, holding his newborn child high for all to see. Tuck sits miserably to one side. Bloody and exhausted, Aslan appears at the hut door. Tuck jumps to his feet, drawing his knife. Heads turn. Tense silence. Robin appears, unsteadily, behind Aslan. Watches, ready to intervene. Tuck stares at Aslan. Raises his blade... and slices down across his own wrist.Ya'll be jus' fine. Lil' smoke ain't gonna kill ya. Scared and injured woodsmen careen out of the trees. Full retreat.'Ere, lads... Over 'ere! We must make a stand. Most of them keep on running.Damn y'all! Ya're no more use than a load o' wet farts.Bollocks, Will. Quit yer bloody bellyachin'. Hal runs to join them, stuttering.C... ccc? What the bloody hell ya sayin'? Cows?... Cowards?...Stop 'ere and flippin' well fight 'em, that's what. Whadya say, lads? Half-hearted support from about a dozen men, including Tack.Nay, reveren'. Ya best be goin' wi' the wenches.Let's give 'em a bloody good wallopin' an' all, lads.'Bout bleedin' time, mush. Tuck is driven to the ground... his assailant is deliver- ing the lethal blow, when Aslan cuts him down. Tuck glances heavenwards.Git the bleedin' 'ell outa there, ya li'l bugger. Distracted, he doesn't see a Celt swing at his back... but Wulf's arrow pierces the man's adam's apple. He freezes in mid-air, before toppling at John's feet. When John turns back, Wulf is being dragged away by three of the Sherrif's men. He attempts to pursue, but is intercepted by two more Celts... and struck down. Aslan charges between the two Celts. Slashes down with both swords. Both men topple to the ground simultaneously. Suddenly all is quiet. The smoking clearing is a mass of fallen bodies. Only four men seem to be alive. Robin, Aslan, Tuck, who is slouched against a tree gasping for breath, and Hal, who kneels clutching his wounded shoulder. Robin dismounts and runs to Little John. Overwhelmed and exhausted, he slumps over the giant's unmoving form.Don't 'ee start bleedin' blubberin', or ya'll make me bloody vomit.I'll wring yer scrawny neck, Will Scarlet. I'd be doin' yer a bloody favor an' all. Quickly, others arrive. Aslan, Tuck, Hal, Fanny, with kids clinging to her skirts.Git us a rope, Hal, and we'll put the bleedin' weasel outa 'is misery.No bugger 'scapes the Sheriff, 'nless 'e's linin' 'is bloomin' pockets.Aye. 'E always did 'ave balls o' brass.Search 'im, Hal. 'E'll 'ave a bloody blade on 'im somewheres. Will eyes the accusing faces. Hal searches, lifts Will's shirt. His whole skin is lacerated with deep gashes and fresh burns.Bugger me. He steps back. Ready to listen.Marriage, eh? What lucky wench gits to play with the Sheriff's codpiece? Will turns his gaze directly on Robin.Aye, and then with King Richard gone, he takes the bloody throne. Everyone reacts with shock. Only Robin appears unsur- prised.'E's in. We're all bloody in. Daft buggers.What in blazes ya doin', woman? Where's the little 'uns?Ya gone bleedin' cracked, girl?Ya should be bloody well mindin' the other seven. Tell 'er, Rob. Robin starts to draw a diagram on the ground with a stick.Fight fair......Or don't fight at all.Come on, ya ckicken-'earted buggers. Ya milksops, ya bleedin' pansies. He can't shoot fast enough. As they descend on him, he leaps from the battlements onto a soldier's back. Grabs his sword.Excuse me, m 'old cock. Ya mind if I borrow this? He's backed up against a battlement, outnumbered five to one.Ya gutless bloody sissies. Someone attacks his assailants from the rear. The tide turns.Wulf! I told ya to keep outa the fightin'.Well, ya'll get a bloody good wallopin' if we get 'ome... For now, let's see how well I taught ya. Wulf sends an attacker plummeting off the parapet.We done it, mate. We clobbered the buggers.", "clean_line": "mead self real honey takes jug sneezes royally spewing brew oblivious hands contaminated jug aslan englishman mead bleedin good ya bloody loss mate swigs passes jug duncan drinks heartily wulf cautiously approaches robin boy speak mon lad drink twill hair bloomin chest wulf tries brew impact instant turns green runs father cracks stumpy ere david doncaster calls im bull hal brownwell lads hal hiccup hiccup belching sounds crack hal embarrassment hal strikes angrily tormentors outlaws got prices eads man jack blasted sheriff says owes im taxes reckon bloody blazes ya toe outside forest ll slaughter like bleedin sheep ya lookin join matie stuff flippin cork man guest gets angrily pushes way group scarlet pay im eed piss wind ya bloody wind mate ere load rubbish agin sheriff bloomin army ya bloody jokin ya daft bugger robin hood ya brave ll ya drink laddie cuz tomorrow ya mayn lucky tomorrow shall best ya crack blasted noble head laughing loudly throws head long draught mead sheriff hasn left bloody pot piss bollocks jus bugger eh overpowered relents defiant glance skulks away ya got short curlies robin hood let hear ya got bleedin ow bloody blazes gonna ll buggered cain bleedin squeak outa em rob reckon cap knows summat rob stubborn ol cocker robin god fearin men kill em aye like tain christian blood curdling screams wagon aslan dragged victim captain face pales silence sure changed color britches gonna laugh bloody balls aye romans built bleedin great wall em agin right lad let close git bugger wulf takes aim arrow slices clear father arrow splitting little john slaps wulf beckons gander mates seen nuthin like bloomin life hush lass ya ll fine ya sittin thar like fat sow help man help marches cheering families holding newborn child high tuck sits miserably bloody exhausted aslan appears hut door tuck jumps feet drawing knife heads turn tense silence robin appears unsteadily aslan watches ready intervene tuck stares aslan raises blade slices wrist ya ll jus fine lil smoke ain gonna kill ya scared injured woodsmen careen trees retreat ere lads ere stand running damn ya use load wet farts bollocks quit yer bloody bellyachin hal runs join stuttering ccc bloody hell ya sayin cows cowards stop ere flippin fight em whadya lads half hearted support dozen men including tack nay reveren ya best goin wi wenches let em bloody good wallopin lads bout bleedin time mush tuck driven ground assailant deliver ing lethal blow aslan cuts tuck glances heavenwards git bleedin ell outa ya li bugger distracted celt swing wulf arrow pierces man adam apple freezes mid air toppling john feet john turns wulf dragged away sherrif men attempts pursue intercepted celts struck aslan charges celts slashes swords men topple ground simultaneously suddenly quiet smoking clearing mass fallen bodies men alive robin aslan tuck slouched tree gasping breath hal kneels clutching wounded shoulder robin dismounts runs little john overwhelmed exhausted slumps giant unmoving form ee start bleedin blubberin ya ll bloody vomit ll wring yer scrawny neck scarlet doin yer bloody favor quickly arrive aslan tuck hal fanny kids clinging skirts git rope hal ll bleedin weasel outa misery bugger scapes sheriff nless linin bloomin pockets aye ave balls brass search im hal ll ave bloody blade im somewheres eyes accusing faces hal searches lifts shirt skin lacerated deep gashes fresh burns bugger steps ready listen marriage eh lucky wench gits play sheriff codpiece turns gaze directly robin aye king richard gone takes bloody throne reacts shock robin appears unsur prised bloody daft buggers blazes ya doin woman little uns ya gone bleedin cracked girl ya bloody mindin seven tell er rob robin starts draw diagram ground stick fight fair fight come ya ckicken earted buggers ya milksops ya bleedin pansies shoot fast descend leaps battlements soldier grabs sword excuse old cock ya mind borrow backed battlement outnumbered ya gutless bloody sissies attacks assailants rear tide turns wulf told ya outa fightin ya ll bloody good wallopin ome let taught ya wulf sends attacker plummeting parapet mate clobbered buggers"}}}
