What are you doing?You have to charm Mr. Herman. Did you charm him? You have to eat, Con. We just want you keep on getting stronger.Are you okay?Oh. Is he? Great!Well. I don't see the old gang much anymore. I miss them. Bring them around... Phil, Don, and Dick Van Buren. We'll play some touch football on the lawn.Con!Well. Regionally.I mean.. it's tragic. Really. Look at him now. He's lost everything.It's not too dry.What happened to little Harry?That girl from the hospital, the one you painted with, she was from Skokie, wasn't she?What was her name?Sharon?Karen.Good god, not the Murrays...I saw Mort Swain. His sister died.The one with the restaurant.I guess so. Why?I don't know. Maybe she died in Idaho. Maybe Kansas City.Berger?Did you?Good! You didn't say anything. Good!When?How did it go?Don't worry about the money, it's okay.Ah, it's okay. And it is necessary. What did you talk about?What about your schedule? Will that be all right?Mmm?Maybe we shouldn't plan to go away right now.Yeah. I know we talked about it, but the more I talk about it, the more the timing doesn't seem right.I know.He's just started with this doctor.No. If he doesn't go through with this now, he might change his mind.You talked to him about it? Does he want to go to London?Who's gonna be there?Why don't we just go to the movies instead?That's not negative. That's unpredictable. Come on. Let's really go to the movies.Really?Beth wanted to go to the movies?Hey. Partner. How are you?Why?Where is he going?Jesus.Hi. Annie. What's your boy up to these days?He's great. Just great.Oh!Oh, no, no. Nothing like that. No, no, just somebody to talk to... that's all. Kind of polish off the rough edges, that's all.Mr. Great. That's me!Hey?I'm not drunk.I dunno. Why not?Come on, for most people, it's a status symbol, right up there with going to Europe.I did not think it was that...Whose privacy?Oh, I'm sorry. That's my fault. I just can never seem to tell anybody that they're not making it.What?Oh, I'm sorry.Huh?Connie's all right. He is. He's okay.I'm not on the rack about him.I can't argue with \"Who knows.\"Thanks.Hang on!Wait, hang on! Whose sweater is it?That's fair!Conrad! Conrad!That's good.Connie. I want one of Connie and his mother.Connie, move in a little closer to your mother. Okay... prize winner...Portrait...Page one, Lake Forrester...Hold it. Connie, smile!Just a second, smile!No, I didn't get it yet , Beth.I want a really good picture of the two of you, OK?Not until I get a picture of the two of you.I didn't see you there. What do you think?Rawlins used to have such great Scotch pines. And they all look like skeletons this year.What's wrong?Hear what?What?Quit? When? Where have you been every night?Why didn't you tell us, Connie?What do you mean? Why wouldn't it matter? Of course it matters. And...What was meant for you?Connie! Now, Connie! Connie!...Connie!...Just stop it, Connie! ...How do you know she never came? You know she came but she had the flu and couldn't come inside, but she came.That's enough! That is enough!What in hell has happened?I am not going to apologize...I am not apologizing. I'm trying to goddamn understand him!Beth. Let's not fight. Okay? No fighting. Okay? Please. Let's go upstairs.I want to talk to you.In a minute...I'm not mad ! I'm just trying to figure out what happened down there.Why don't you tell her?Why not?She was upset, Conrad. Your mother was hurt because you quit the swim team. I don't understand it myself.What then? Explain it to me.What things?Your mother doesn't hate you, Conrad?What about this Dr. Berger? Do you think he's helping you?I'll be downstairs if you need me.OK.See you later.I want to be clear.In the car, I was thinking: \"be clear.\". I suppose that's what psychiatry's about. Being precise and clear. And honest, of course. I'll level with you. I'm not a great believer in psychiatry.I know what happens here is only between you and him, and...I like that, I respect that. And...he's better, I can see that. I am not trying to put you down, I just don't believe in psychiatry as a panacea for everybody.I wish I knew what the hell I was doing here.I don't know actually, I'm not sure, I think I meant in terms of Conrad. You see, I knew something was wrong even before he tried to... to kill himself. But I thought that... It's clear that he's very smart. He's been an \"A\" student ever since he started school, and naturally I thought that ...intelligent people could work out their own problems.Yeah, sure I do. It's hard not to. It was luck. It was just luck that I happened to be there when he tried it. I could have been at a meeting. We both could've been away. It was luck!No! No. No. I used to. I used to think... that I was a lucky person... before... the \"accident\". Mmm, I guess the whole of life is nothing but an accident, is it? What happens to you. I should do with it.Yeah. Maybe, maybe I am drifting a little. I can see myself, ...and I can see the two of them drifting away from me, and I just stand there watching.Something. I gotta do something about it. I don't know what.Yeah... No. I don't know. I see her not being able to forgive him.Oh, I don't know exactly. Being too much like her. People always think that she and Buck are... were ...were alike. But it's really she and Conrad. They were the only two that didn't cry at the funeral, you know? It's not easy for me to admit this but, uh... she didn't... His mother doesn't show him a great deal of affection. I'm not trying to put her down in any way at all. She is a wonderful woman, huh...Oh, god, yes, she loved Buck! Bucky got so much... I think what she felt for him was special. You know, he was her first-born. That's not unusual, is it?Me? I loved Buck.For me you mean?Mmm. She's very... No. There's no problem with her for me. We've been... We've been married nearly twenty one years. Everybody loves Beth. But, huh... for Conrad, - it's been difficult. He didn't talk about that? We don't know what happens here. It doesn't come up. I guess that's what it is. It's private here. Isn't it?I think I know why I came here. I think I came here to talk about myself.This will sound strange.Could we talk about Buck's funeral?I know it'll seem trivial, but it's on my mind, or has been, and I'd just like to talk about it.When I was getting dressed for Buck's funeral, I was...Just let me get it off my chest,OK?I was wearing a blue shirt. And you said: - Wear a white shirt and the other shoes! It was nothing at the time. But it's always seemed to stay with me. And I, for some reason, been thinking about it and it suddenly occured to me what difference did it make what I wore at Buck's funeral?Just hear me out, Beth! It won't hurt you to listen!I just want to talk about something I always remembered.Because I've always wondered, in some needling way, what it mattered what I wore. I was crazy that day. We were going to our son's funeral. And you were worried about what I wore on my feet. I'm sure it sounds like nothing to you, but it sticks with me and I just wanted to ...tell you about it.I don't think so. I think we should go see him, Beth. - Dr. Berger.I think we could all go and see him together.He thinks it's a good idea.Exactly. That's the point. Wouldn't it be easier if we all talked about it? In the open.Darling, that is what this is for. Maybe you'll get a surprise.I am not asking you to be perfect, you're missing the point.Huh, no... Could you give me a couple of minutes, please?I do too. I want all of them to be nice ChristmasesOkay. Okay.I love you, too.Seven.I'll never get over how flat it is here. I'll never get over...Airplane scotch.Boy, oh, boy.Oh, these holes sure do love you. Oh boy, oh boy.Pinehurst would be nice. I think Connie would like Pinehurst.Well, you said \"vacation\", so I just assumed you meant him too.I was gonna call him tonight.Six. Let's finish this.What you started.What you started.I think there is a point.He isn't the problem.No, he isn't. Let's talk about what's really bothering you.Jesus, what have I done to make you so angry with me?Can't you see anything except in terms of how it affects you?Well, stop being so godamn honest, and start being a little generous! And start thinking about him for a while!Well, I'll tell you what he expects!All he wants... All he wants is to know you don't hate him. That's it.I just try to keep this family together...It's pretty early. You tired?I hope your grandmother wasn't too tough on you?I don't...You are beautiful. And you are unpredictable. But you're so cautious. You're determined, Beth. But you know something? You're not strong. And I don't know if you're really giving. Beth is looking at him not knowing what this is about.We would've been all right, if there hadn't been any ...mess. But you can't handle mess. You need everything neat and ...easy. I don't know. Maybe you can't love anybody. It was so much Buck. And Buck died, it was as if you buried all your love with him, and I don't understand that. I just don't know.The yard looks smaller without leaves.Your mother's going away for a while.Back to Houston. Then I... I don't know.No.Don't do that! Don't do that to yourself! It's nobody's fault! Things happen in this world, people don't always have answers for them, you know.Oh, yeah?Oh, he needed it. You didn't. You were always so hard on yourself, I never had the heart.No, it's the truth. I... I never worried about you. I just wasn't listening.No, no, no, I should ...I should've got a handle on it somehow.Well, don't admire people too much.

How it used to get on top of your car, and he take off when you pulled out of the driveway.Yeah. That was the closest we ever came to having a pet. You remember Buck asked you, he tried to talk you into... getting a dog. Do you remember that? He said. \"How about it, if it's the size of a little football?\"Pippin. Pippin. Pippin!Arf! Arf!

John Boy?My father came into my room and he didn't know what to say. This is right after Buck died. And he came over and sat on the bed next to me, put his arm around my shoulder. We just sat there. I remember I was watching his shoe. And thinking... Cos his shoe was turned over on its side. I was thinking: \"He's so uptight, it's gonna crack off.\"I dunno. I kept thinking that John Boy would've said something...about the way he felt, you know. Something.I don't know.Come on what?I'm not asking you for anything.Nothing.I don't think that ...that quitting swimming will mess up my life. I... I really don't.Yeah.Uh, uh.Okay!I won't ask you to ...sir.Yeah.Yeah.I don't know. I felt like it was a bore.Well, that's the way it is.Nothing.Nothing.Nothing. Swimming's a bore. That's all.Well, quit talking to people! Okay?I haven't told him yet.I don't know. The timing isn't right, you know. He sweats everything so much, he'll just get worried about it.My mother?

What do you think?Dad, I quit the swim team.Nowhere. Around. The library mostly.I don't know, I didn't think it mattered.Don't you have that backwards?I didn't lie!Well don't then! Go to Europe!Cos the only reason she cares, the only reason she gives a fuck about it......is because someone else knew about it first!No! You tell her to stop it! You never tell her a godamn thing! And I know why she never came to the hospital, she's busy going to goddamn Spain and... goddamn Portugal! Why should she care if I'm hung up by the balls out there?You never came to the hospital!Yeah! She wouldn't have had any flu if Buck was in the hospital! She would have come if Buck was in the hospital!I need to sleep.I didn't mean it. I didn't mean any of it. I am sorry. Please don't be mad.I don't know what happened! I am sorry about it all. I am sorry about the whole thing. What I said, I didn't mean it. Just please tell her. Tell her I'm sorry, will you?Oh, God, no, I can't! Don't you see? I can't talk to her!Ha!

You don't see things!That she hates me! Can't you see that?All right, all right. You're right. She doesn't. Please leave me alone, now.Don't blame it on Burger, it's not his fault!You're the doctor.Okay. Okay.Yeah, but I don't blame her. I mean, she's got... She's got her reasons. It's impossible after all the shit I've pulled!Lately?Hey, come on, if you... Listen, I'm never gonna be forgiven for that. Never! You know, you can't get it out, you know, all the blood in her towels, in her rug. Everything had to be pitched. Even the tiles in the bathroom had to be regrouted. Christ, she fired the godamn maid because she couldn't dust the living room right. If you think I'm gonna forgive... - that she's gonna forgive me...I think I just figured something out.Who it is who can't forgive who...I've heard this all before.I'm so tired.So what do I do now?You mean, like she can't love me?But she loves my father. I know she loved my brother. It's me!That's different. He feels responsible. Besides, he loves everybody.What do you mean?You mean me?What did I do?Come on!What do you mean? You're gonna pull the plug... Come on! What did I do?Rules? What rules? Can't I have a few minutes?Jesus!It's all German pudding with you, dad, you don't see things.Tell her to stop it! You never tell her a godamn thing!She hates me! Can't you see that?Hmm?Oh, that's all right.Well, listen. We don't have to go bowling if you'd rather not, I'm not a bowling nut or anything. How funny are you?Hoo, that's pretty funny. Hey, well, listen, I promise you won't look silly.Guarantee it.Can't break the ball, can't break the floor, can't break anything in a bowling alley. And that's what I like about bowling alleys. Can't even break the record.Just \"anyway\", it's a conversation starter.You like it?I thought it'd get to you. I've been working on it all day.You mean by God?Mmm, I don't believe in God.No. Well, it's not a question of degree. Either you do or you don't.So you're afraid he'll punish you for something you did?Yeah? So have I.No, I dunno, I don't remember really.Ah, I don't know... I've never really talked about it. To doctors, but not to anyone else. You're the first who's asked.Uh... I don't know. It was like... falling into a hole. It was like falling into a hole, and it keeps getting bigger and bigger, .and you can't get out, and then, .all of a sudden, it's inside...and you're the hole, and you're trapped, and it's all over. Something like that. And it's not really scary, except it is when you think back on it. 'Cause you know what you were feeling stange and new...Yeah, they were pretty funny.What?

I'm with a patient now. Can you call back at two fifteen?Then give me your number. I'll call you tonite. Hello? Hello?Ha! Hi! Come in. It's OK, they all do that.Hmm.... Jarrett. How long since you've been out of the hospital?Feeling depressed?On stage?People nervous... treating you like you're ...a dangerous character?Are you?How long were you in the hospital?What did you do?It doesn't say what your method was.Oh.Friends?OK?Everything...You're back in school? Everything okay at school? Teachers?No problems?So why are you here?Why?Who's worried about you?What about your mother? Isn't she worried about you, too?Well, as long as you're straight.Yes. He called me on the phone. He told me your name and... he told me to look for you. And, uh... he said you had a brother who died. A... boating accident, wasn't it? Want to tell me about it?How did that go?Why do you want to change?Why?Well. I'll tell you something. I'll be straight with you, okay? I'm not big on control. But it's your money.So to speak. Okay...Well. Control's a tough nut.Well. That's a problem. How do we solve that?Well. It's up to you.Mm-mmm.I don't hold much stock in dreams.Really? What's happening? What's going on?What?Look. Kiddo... I lied. I do believe in dreams. Only sometimes I want to know what's happening when you're awake. Come on, something's bugging you, making you nervous. You're making me nervous.Tranquilizer?I think you came in here looking like something out of The Body Snatchers. It's not my impression that you need a tranquilizer.Clock.Mmm, mmm.Right.Ha, ha.Ha, ha.Ah, ah?... Have you ever thought about quitting?No.Forget about how it looks! How does it feel?Yes!Yes! How does it feel?Are you the same person you were last year?That's why you need a tranquilizer?No. It's up to you!Not necessarily.Is anyplace easy?It was? Why?Was there anyone there you could talk to?I mean, besides Dr. Crawford?What do you expect from her?Why not?What are you thinking?So what else is new? Does it help?What now?Who?Yeah. What about him?So much as what?What would John Boy have said?Come on.Don't hold back.So, what did your dad say about it?How come?Can you tell your mother?No. Sorry's out. Come on, something's on your mind.No, no, never mind the time. There's time. Look. Remember the contract? Control? Maybe there's some connection between control and uh... \u00ad what do we call it? - lack of feeling? Mmm?When?When?Come on, come on, Jarrett, I thought you didn't like to fool around.Like to play games, do you?So?I'll tell you what I want. I want you to leave \"I don't know\" out there on the table with the magazines. Okay?Yeah. That would be nice. Make one up. Right now. About how there's no feelings in there.Oh! Now you have, now you don't! Get it together, Jarrett.Are you mad?Oh, cut the shit! You're mad! You're mad as hell! You don't like being pushed. So why don't you do something about it!Tell me to fuck off! I don't know.Why not?Why not?Do you know how much energy it takes to hold it back?Oh! I beg your pardon! I never promised you a rose garden...What?Yeah?That's it!What do you think?Sounds good to me.A little advice about feeling, kiddo... Don't expect it always to tickle.Tuesday you felt great. You bought a Christmas tree, it was all hunky- dory. Okay?Don't take refuge in one-liners like \"You're the doctor\". Okay? Because that pisses me off.So everything was fine till you had the fight with your mother, then everything was lousy.What shit have you pulled? Hey! Remember! I'm talking proportion here. Now, what shit?Uh, uh.What?What?Well a real problem... a real problem has a real solution.Doesn't make it any less true.Yeah, well... that's a hell of a secret you've been keeping on yourself.Recognize her limitations.Oh, kiddo, no. Like she can't love you enough. Like don't blame her for not loving you more than she's able.Ha! Now we're back to the rotten kid routine! She can't love you because you're unlovable. Where does that leave your dad? How come he loves you? You're a rottenkid, doesn't he know that?Ho, I get it! The guy's got no taste! He loves you, but he's wrong. Look... maybe she just can't express it the way you'd like her to. Maybe she's just afraid to show you what she feels.I mean there's someone besides your mother you've got to forgive.Why don't you give yourself a break? Let yourself off the hook?We'll talk about it on Thursday.Time's up.Come on, Con. You know the rules.You think about it. Just think about it.That's good.Okay.Neither do I.Well, you said you... thought you could shed some light on some things. What did you mean by that?But you still feel responsible?You think of yourself as a lucky man, then?That sounds more like the philosophy of a drifter than a tax attorney.What would you want to do about that?And you see them as on ...opposite sides of this fence?For what?Did she give Buck much affection to ...Buck?And you?What I mean is, your wife's affection.Yes.Mm-hmm. Very private.Okay. Why don't we?Hello?What's going on?What time is it?Where are you?All right. Listen to me. Get to the office somehow, and I'll meet you there.Oh, good. You're here.Just wait, just hold on...Just wait till we get inside...Shit. You'd think they'd assume there'd be an emergency now and then?!What?It's what?What do you need? Tell me!Don't try.For what?What did you do?What did you do?Point? What point? It happened!I know that, it wasn't your fault.And that wasn't fair, was it?Because I got tired!It hurts to be mad at him, doesn't it?Bad things happen even when people are careful.OK, so you made a mistake.Maybe you were stronger. Did it ever occur to you that you might have been stronger?Why don't you?I know.Jesus.No. She wasn't.What?And what?You saw her once and now you' want to take her on too?No?What?Okay. Listen. I feel bad about it too.You're right. It isn't fair.Um-hmm. And what was the one wrong thing you did?You know.You know.Exactly.Now. You can live with that. Can't you?Feelings are scary. And sometimes they're painful. And if you can't feel pain, then you're not gonna feel anything else either. You know what I'm saying?You're here and you're alive. And don't tell me you don't feel that.It is good. Believe me.Because I'm your friend.I am.
