Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --Since when? What the hell is this room?Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?!And I worked there. For a year.They changed the layout.They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--Right, Jack Bangs. Uh... guy was always talking bout fixing the place up. Maybe get a better crowd. Musta gone and done it while I was in the Mountain. I don't know this map, man. How the hell am I supposed to tell you what door goes where?When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh... ...the Powwow Safe.His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed.You'd have to get me inside. Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.They won't recognize me.Trust me. They won't recognize me.'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.I give you the wrong information, you're gonna shoot me. Well, I don't know your damn map. So you can either find a way to get me in there... or you can shoot me right now.More than you know.What the hell is this? What happened to working together?Might as well be.Get your own room.But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.For what? You to talk me into \"helping\"?

What \"we\"...Get your own room, Ashley.Get your own room.They've never done a robbery... Christmas is looking up.Not with you.A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?At least gimme video poker.Do I get a country-western name?Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --I'm gonna need some money.Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?Monster. If we're working together here, we gotta be working together. I can't walk in there looking like the Lone Fucking Ranger with ten bucks to throw down. You don't want me getting noticed, right? Not getting noticed costs a guy at least a couple hundred.You ready to gamble, darlin'?Y'all take care of my guitar.Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. Tables've been moved around; the big man's office, I dunno, might be upstairs now.Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.You start spending your brother's money. I'm gonna take a circuit around the joint, check for any new ins and outs. I'll snag us some drinks.Couple rum and Cokes, please.Roadside casino?Prison.He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.Heyyyy!There went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... Ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. I gotta fix this thing -- -- drink this for me.Hundred bucks to wear this jacket --Nobody's killing you, kid. Santa's giving you a rhinestone jacket and a hundred bucks.GO! GO!MEDIUM RARE?! You call this MEDIUM RARE??!!That's for reading her mail.Come on.We get to the bridge, we're all right!Get to the bridge! HEY! HEY! DOWN HERE!I-I-I-I have n-n-no g-g-gifts to br- br-bring, pa rum-p-p-p-p-p ...pum-pum-pum. N-n-no treasures for the k-k-k ...king.Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum....never... tried......ttt..tt... two out of three?Nnn... nothing...Nothing... I promise-nothing...NO!He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!No, Gabriel... no......he... he asked me... how I'd heard about his place... he didn't know it was me...I PROMISE YOU HE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS ME!Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...He had some points to make...All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns......Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...You saved me.Guy I was in with... car thief... I used to read your letters to him. I know they were private... I know, but... you spend twenty-four hours a day with somebody, you gotta talk, y'know? You gotta share. Or the room gets even smaller. And sometimes, I'd be reading them, and he'd close his eyes, get a smile on his face... and I'd know somewhere inside he was pretending you were writing to him -- He'd see your face, your pictures on the wall... Some nights I think he fell in love with you, too.You gave a couple guys hope, Ashley. And with hope, there ain't nothing you can't survive.Don't say my name...Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.They'll have guns.You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.We'll need one.I'm going to have to be inside that casino. When it happens. I'll need to be part of it. I can't just be drawing some map.We need to find a way to make me part of it.If we're helping them with their robbery, we're gonna be doing more than just walking away. Like that's some Christmas bonus.You want him outta your life? You want a real New Year to look forward to? If we're gonna do this... we're gonna do it to get it all.I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pumWhat you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.You gotta get someone upstairs.Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access.Uh... they change it every month. I wouldn't know. If there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. You gotta draw 'em out.I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.What?Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front. You need six.You need six.You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six. Six is me.You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it.Six men means six guns.I'm no threat without a gun.There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat.Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?You gotta be kidding me.What, we walking in there and delivering toys?I'm almost done.If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here.You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?Is there any way you could get into his truck?We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?Keep 'em there for a little while.We're gonna get you out of Detroit, Ash. Get you out of beauty and fragrances. Remember that. After all this is over, when you know me, when you really know me... remember it was me.Gun, gun, c'mon, boys like you gotta be keeping a gun...Here's my present to you, truck drivers --Catch, dammit, catch! Like riding a bike, it's like riding a bike!How far you gonna get, Rudy...Hey.You guys were paying for the room, I just figured --This time right now... Dad's stacking wood out back, getting ready for tomorrow. Little blaze in the fireplace. Mom's setting out the good silver, hanging her cinammon sticks, up in the doorways. Getting out her scratchy old records... singing along...I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.Well. I'm going home.Hey Jumpy, I want to ask you something. You have any problem with the fact that we're on our way to take millions of dollars from an Indian casino?Hey-hey, egg nog for everybody!Let's win some MONEY! MONEY-MONEY- MONEY!We're out of work tonight, that's how! Christmas Eve! We're out of work!We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, but we got charitable donations!I got wampum for the Cocktail Waitress Civil Defense Fund!

Told you that from the start.We still gonna spend Christmas together?Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!I did time with Nick Mason, remember? I knew he worked here, didn't I!? Well, some shit he told me!Nick told me his manager kept a safe in his office, his stealing safe. His Powwow Safe. I swear, please... Nick told me. Behind the liquor cabinet.Pow. Wow.Me too.Smoke 'em if you got 'em.I'm sorry.Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers.I saved your life.He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.Maybe this is where you wanted him, Ashley. At the bottom of a ravine, dead as ice with a burnt-up heart. Maybe. But it didn't happen. 'Cause what you did for him was make him the happiest held ever been. You showed him hope and taught him mercy. And he died a peaceful man. You wanted to destroy some convict... and all you did was save his soul. Remember that. Love your money and remember that.I'm glad it was me.How'd you know my name...Rudy. How'd you know my name?You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.No --But I never said Rudy.I never told you my name.How'd you know my name was Rudy.How'd you know my name.Where is he.She set them up. All of them.And you set me up.How'd you know I'd do it.Walk outta there and tell her I was you.Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd rememberYou gave them me.LIKE RIDING A BIKE, LIKE RIDING A BIKE, LIKE RIDING A BIIIIIKE!RULE ONE!

We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.And Nick? If you even think about setting us up, giving us some bad information? We go down... you go down... Now. Christmas Eve. How many guards are there gonna be?And which of these doors here lead up to the security level?What?I did.What the fuck are you talking about.We walked the place for a week.What?They wouldn't have changed the security setup.So what the hell good are you...Wrong, convict. You walk in there, they recognize you.They recognize him, they'll remember him after the job goes down.Why not.We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.Bring back some memories, Nick?Rather be back in the Mountain?Don't have Weather Channel in the Mountain, Nick.Sleep good, loverboy. Tomorrow you got singing for your supper to do.Take a look what Pug's bought for ya.Put it on.You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.You do.Shut the fuck up. You play what your girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in with you. You talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. You walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, I want to know the run of the place.You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.Get out.You got one hour.Don't tip.Don't. Lose.Get in there and watch 'em. Watch their every fuckin' move.Where the hell's he going?Get him!Where the HELL did he go?Get. Him. Back.At the rate you're going, Nick... I'm gonna have a hard time ever considering you family.How lucky ya feeling now.A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In the spirit of the season, I'm going to give you a chance. I understand you're unhappy. Right outta the lockup, here against your will, it's the holidays and there's reruns onWe're each going to get one of these. Whichever one of us hits closer to the bullseye... gets what he wants. You land closer, you get Ashley. And you guys get to go free. I land closer... and we start getting your help.May the best sportsman win.Damn.Got something to say to me, Nick?What'd you tell that casino manager?You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else......Dispatcher's screaming for me to haul ass, he's got a load on the runback for me. Shipper's making me wait for the pickup, receiver's bitching 'bout the count......Got the cops at the bottom of every mountain, got the DOT at the top. And every day, every day, I see all those faces in their little airbag Hot Wheels, moms and pops and jam- faced kiddies, giving me that look to go to hell and get off their happy goddamn highway. Hey. They don't gotta get two thousand miles by sundown, or the gang don't eat come sunrise.It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you. Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?Nick. I been trying to hit you.Maybe that'll help sharpen your memory.Tonight we're gonna take another look at that map. And this time you're gonna tell me what I need to know.Start singing.Sing it in pictures, Nick.What's the code?We got five. Putting Ashley outside.NO.No.I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.No way.No, you're not.No gun.That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys.Not on Christmas Eve.'Tis the season, convict.Can't be attracting attention, right?He wants the money....whoever she is.All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...Searching for a money man...-- till he fucked his parole --That's a book, baby. That's a book of love.I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.I've been doing good, though.Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.He'll be dead when he does.Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you...Checking out.That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view. And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.You wanted a weapon, convict? You got one.Merry Christmas-Eve.Commit this thing to memory. Every guard, every exit... don't tape it to your fuckin, wrist: remember it. That's the Gospel right there. The Gospel. Matthew, Mark, Luke and John...Go.Hey, Sears! Hey, Wal-Mart!American beer.Be back, Wal-Mart. Watch my bank.Video room, video room --Map said video room --Map said goddamn video room!WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON??!!!Show's over.Santa Claus, Santa Claus, and Santa Claus... would you please bring our... mapmaker... to the security level?I told you not to fuck us with that map, Nick. I told you not to, and you did. How am I s'posed to keep my promises now? How's she s'posed to keep hers?He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe.THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!We KNOW about the Powwow Safe! We KNOW it's in here! We KNOW how you work! Because WE know who's worked for you! Remember a guy named Nick Mason!? A security guard named Nick Mason!?Where is he?! Where is he?!You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --Open it.OPEN IT!!!GO!!!With the wrong fucking guy! We took the place down with the wrong fucking guy! Is that Christmas?! Huh?! Is that Christmas?!God bless us every one...You almost got away with it, Santa. Got outta the Tomahawk, got to your car, got halfway to Canada till you caught some ice in the road. By the time you hit bottom down there, whole car was burning like a comet. Musta burned up all that money too.Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End.She told me 'bout the convict magazines. Had to figure there'd be some boys in the pen with some useful knowledge. With nobody to talk to. Nobody to listen.
