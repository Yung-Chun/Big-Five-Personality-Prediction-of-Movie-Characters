We, however, did not have the luxury of time...We've achieved almost total eradication of the roach population. As of today, the disease has been officially contained.Sus, come on. You're missing it.Fucking thing! I hope someone's taping this. Susan, come on. It's really good this time. I got most of the lines out. Sus?Life's a bitch. Our 15 minutes came and went and all we got was bad cable...Hiding from the hard glare of publicity?A shame. You looked great tonight.You did!Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?You hear that? Flawless.We know we saved lives.There're gonna be a lot of kids running around next year because of you.Who know? We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.Oh, I don't know. People are beginning to talk about us...Excuse me, ladies...\"Baby in a bottle...\"You know where they get this fertility stuff? They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.Don't get kinky here...Okay, meet me out front. I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight.Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell \"Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!\"You really love flashing that thing, don't you?Peter Tyler, DOH. You gentlemen were the first on the scene?You gone in?Good.Get the EMT's in there, now.Jesus.There's plenty of systemic infection already, so as soon as we get a preliminary reading, start them on anti-biotics. You saw this?Internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have it. No definite signs of TB, but we'll quarantine them a week just to make sure.Tell them to send flowers to the usual address.Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?Tell her she's going to be alright. We'll take care of her.Dark Angels?Josh, what was Immigration's countdown?There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...Remember what that woman said, about people being taken? Check with the copsin the area.Sus?Susan?Thought it was my week for that.Okay. So you lost a great specimen-We?Maybe they lied to you.So?Here, let me...Okay, guys. We'll take it from here.Let's keep it at five and I won't condemn your clubhouse.Look, a broken tooth...Shit.Honey, just leave it.Look, I showed you my badge...The Department of Public Health...Fine. You want me to call your supervisor?Excuse me, I'm talking to you.For Chrissakes. You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us?Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!He wants a permit, I'll get him a permit.Heya. Where's the boss?You okay?Maybe you should sit...Great crowd.Fuck 'em. They don't know what they're missing.What's wrong?Oh, no, you were-Susan, we're not b-...I think it's some kind of systemic infection, Chris. I saw a few cases like it yesterday. A sweatshop in Canal.It'll come back to me.Looks like a Lyme disease rash.You said that thing was big as your hand. I don't think I'm going to miss...No.Susan, listen to me: you handled that insect almost as much as Siri...I know. But if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed.Chris is going to run some blood tests on you. I want you to stay here till he's absolutely sure you're clean. Okay? Then you'll call me... You'll catch up with us...We'll be all right, Sus. I promise.Guess someone requested you for overtime...buddy.Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...We'll be back at the platform in...20 minutes. Susan?Ammonia.Yeah...?Weird shit...?I want a team in here by six tonight, hands and knees with toothpicks...Don't!!Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-It's okay. I'm all right.He's all right, too.You got a better way up?Go Josh. Now.Any luck?You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?What?For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart?Shh! Shh!Woman?Listen to me: we're getting you out.Give me your belts.What's...?I'm coming, Sus, I'm coming.Toss the flare down!Just do it!Oh, Jesus...Wrap it around your hand!Come on!Get on my shoulders!Let's go!Oh, shit...Push it! Push it! Don't let up!We don't know!! We don't know what it is!Wait a minute-Its muscles are locked.Hey hey hey...Just keep holding it. Can you do that for me? Susan?You feel anything?Leonard, listen. I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back. Look, I'm trying to help you here...I'm sorry. But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.A mistake.It doesn't matter, all right? It's dead.So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...Is there a switch?They're coming!How?!It's no use! They know we're in here!Right. Hardwired to eat anything that's not like them!What are you doing?What-Can we get this car there?Just talk me through it. I can go with Manny.We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us- we Goddam mimic them!It worked before...That's why we should do it now.Depends. You got a memo?Try not to sweat?I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...In the tool box under the kitchen counter...Green...Blue...Dammit!Manny...Come on, kid...Jesus!The kid's with them!!Go!! Just go!!Shit.Jump in.You go first. I'll be right below you.I can. We can do this...Don't hold your breath! Keep it going, even flow!C'mon...Talk to me.Hang onto me.Hang on tight!Come on!We can do it!We-can-do-this!!!It'll be fine... it... They're still down there.

We were able to create a biological counter-agent. A new ally, if you will...Blattida Traditor.The \"Judas Roach\".The Judas is a non-carrier of Stricklers, with a short life-span and heightened pheromone emission.The female is basically a sexual magnet; common males travelled miles and fought for the right to mate with them.When they did, they took away something else we added -- a hormone, passed through sexual congress that causes their metabolism to go into overdrive. No matter what their food intake, they starved to death in a matter of hours.Please.Do you think we did the right thing?You know what I mean...We did no impact evaluation. The consequences of...We just don't know.We're down to a \"couple\" now, huh?Don't worry, I'll save your honor. Maybe I'll even marry you....no, guys, these have to fit perfectly. No spaces in between. Let me tell you why. Insects have no hands. All they have is this set of mandibles.See? This little piggy will grab the prey.Then this little piggy will tear it in half......and this little one will grind it to a pulp and push it in... all the way into the mouth. These are precision tools here. Can you remember that?Good. Then get it right.Don't tease.Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?Trust me. I've never been this late. Never.If nun's pee is what it takes...You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.I'll be late.Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower. Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions......as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.Watch your step, Siri. Your grant could be on the line here.What?Oh, Jesus.Come on, darlin'...What's this?Hello.I suppose so.Metaxonycha Godmani, Trigonopelastes Delta. Field Butterflies. Have you been upstate?I guess they got lost in this city.You guys have done a nice job. How bout five dollars?Fellas, I'll tell you what...ten dollars for everything. Plus a killing jar, some tweezers and mounts so the next bunch you catch will be in better shape.Alphabet City kids- there's much worse things they could be selling.Siri? Siri?!Can you...?Could you...help me...?I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?I have no idea. Are you ready?It bit you.This wing configuration. I've never...And they're not fully developed. This thing's not even an adult.My God.It's breathing.I know. Help me get a sample.Hold on, big guy, hold on...Hold on a second...Call security.I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!Don't you get it? It's more than that.You know why insects don't grow larger? Because they don't have a complex respiratory system. What I saw did. It had lungs.Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.I did a PH test on its tarsal pads.There's only two species who match the enzymes I found. One's a leaf-cutter ant in the Amazon...The other we released here two years ago.Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...Even if they did... that's all we have, isn't it?Pull over!Metaxonycha Godmani.We're here to deal.You sure you didn't see one of these?An \"Ootheca\". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh \"weirdbugs\" inside.You okay?There's something under here.Let me try. My hands are smaller.No, there's...That's wonderful! What grade are you in?I guess that could be arranged.I heard how you talked to him.He was just doing his job.No such thing, baby.I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.Right.Oh...nothing that a little menopausal's pee daikiri couldn't cure. Least that's what I thought.I was just late.Ironic, don't you think? These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...Siri...Siri!...you don't even know what you're looking for.Why take the chance? Just let me go down there with you...It didn't bite me.You tell me.What about Siri?You think it's some form of Strickler's, don't you?Oh, my God.What's your name?Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?Did you hear me? Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!!Where'd you find it?Posterior sternites are gone...half the protonum rotted off.Near hatching. Thing must've died about three weeks ago.Do you have a polaroid?It's me. Can you hear me?I have.I'm on my way. I've got something for you to look at...Okay....Peter?HELP!!!Don't.No, Jesus, no.Peter...It doesn't have a heart.Just inner chambers...No...That's what it wanted you to see.That's camouflage...This is mimicry. They evolve to mimic their predators. A butterfly can look like the eyes of an owl. A catterpillar can copy a snake...This has evolved to mimic the most dangerous predator it's ever had...Us.Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud?All these...they're like tunnels of an insect colony. Once these things hit a certain population density, they'll have to move out, form new colonies.We have to get help down here. Burn the tunnels before...The lights!I got it!Hurry! Please!Oh, God. The blood...His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!Exac...Give me your razor.Rub it on the windows!Just do it!!Scent glands. Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.But the power...Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!Peter-The scent won't last...Manny...We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.You're going to have to keep it really slow. Their eyes react to sudden movements.Don't touch it. And for Godsakes, try not to sweat. They can sense chemical changes...That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.Open it.Choke on it, motherfuckers.The scent's fading...Over here! Over here! Goddam you!!THE DOOR! OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!Peter!!Run!! Peter!!GO!!What?MOVE BACK!!!You all right?Which way?We're no leaving you!There.I can't tell if it's working!Oh, come on, come on!Your arm, you can't...We're gonna make it!Ah...Peter...Don't look back!No...They've come up...", "clean_line": "ll aid genetic labs country recombined cockroach dna genetic information termites mantids able create biological counter agent new ally blattida traditor judas roach judas non carrier stricklers short life span heightened pheromone emission female basically sexual magnet common males travelled miles fought right mate took away added hormone passed sexual congress causes metabolism overdrive matter food intake starved death matter hours think right thing know mean impact evaluation consequences know couple huh worry ll save honor maybe ll marry guys fit perfectly spaces let tell insects hands set mandibles little piggy grab prey little piggy tear half little grind pulp push way mouth precision tools remember good right tease monks bottle wine trust ve late nun pee takes ran ice underwear forget ll late siri sandblast thing looks like trump tower mounds supposed dirt excretions long ready opening care tell watch step siri grant line oh jesus come darlin hello suppose metaxonycha godmani trigonopelastes delta field butterflies upstate guess got lost city guys nice job bout dollars fellas ll tell dollars plus killing jar tweezers mounts bunch catch better shape alphabet city kids worse things selling siri siri help gonna pull want pin okay idea ready bit wing configuration ve fully developed thing adult god breathing know help sample hold big guy hold hold second security needed think weather channel thing size fist peter charts know insects grow larger complex respiratory saw lungs evolution work fast pushed thing leap need specimen ph test tarsal pads species match enzymes leaf cutter ant amazon released years ago going ll tell stop isn pull metaxonycha godmani deal sure ootheca eggcase probably uh weirdbugs inside okay let try hands smaller wonderful grade guess arranged heard talked job thing baby feeling came potroast apterids right oh little menopausal pee daikiri couldn cure thought late ironic think guys hatch hundreds offspring single clutch eggs right siri siri know looking chance let bite tell siri think form strickler oh god okay jeremy dr chris raymond hear dr raymond posterior sternites gone half protonum rotted near hatching thing ve died weeks ago polaroid hear way ve got look okay peter help jesus peter heart inner chambers wanted camouflage mimicry evolve mimic predators butterfly look like eyes owl catterpillar copy snake evolved mimic dangerous predator mantids mimic gave judas code baby peter aren proud like tunnels insect colony things hit certain population density ll form new colonies help burn tunnels lights got hurry oh god blood blood driving crazy mask odor know peter sense hardwired exac razor rub windows scent glands insects use em identify power peter couldn fix tv peter scent won manny ll ll going slow eyes react sudden movements touch godsakes try sweat sense chemical changes breathe easy open choke motherfuckers scent fading goddam door open fucking door peter run peter right way leaving tell working oh come come arm gonna ah peter look ve come"}}}
