{"Proposal-The": {"RICHARD": {"raw_line": "Where are my clothes? A blob beneath the sheets next to him answers. SIMONE is the model on the walls and is really, really hot.Sorry, I gotta go. I'm late. Richard hurries to the kitchen. Socks are on the butcher block next to an empty champagne bottle. Shoes in the sink. He finds his pants on the floor and puts them on. RICHARD Have you seen my belt? Simone looks around and sees it tied to her headboard.Baby, I just can't do this anymore.You're just too much for me. And I'm just another guy too wrapped up in his job.Let's not end it like that. It's been an amazing three and a half weeks. Thank you. And you should know that you have the nicest ass I've ever been with.I do. It's magnificent.I know you do. Simone smiles and begins to seductively pull the sheets off her naked body. Richard shakes his head \"no\" and smiles. RICHARD I really gotta go.Jillian, you are the best.See ya tomorrow.She doesn't exactly consult with me on these things.Welcome to my nightmare. The doors close as...You've got a conference call in thirty, a staff meeting at nine, and your immigration lawyer sent some papers for you to sign.Nice job.I'm sure. You want him on the phone?What? Richard doesn't know what Margaret is talking about, until she nods at the cup. He's embarrassed.Uh...Oh. Well, it won't be wrinkled for long.Yes.No. I've sprayed them with stuff that will take care of the wrinkles.Anything that's wrinkled.Will do. Richard makes a note. Margaret stops to make her point.Got it.He's up and about to pop.No problem. I'll just cancel my trip this weekend.It was my Grandma's ninetieth birthday. But no big deal. You were right before, I need to stay focused. Professional.Well tell gammy that I'm sorry. Mom, she's making me work this weekend. It's not like I volunteered. I'm sure dad is pissed. Margaret comes to Richard's desk. He tries to wrap it up. RICHARD I have to go. Yeah. No, I'm not going to do that! No. Sorta. Mom! No. Bye. Richard hangs up the phone. RICHARD Sorry about that. Damage control.No. No. Um. Yes? But as I've explained to them, after three years together, you're the only person on the planet who can make me editor, so that's the way it is. Richard's phone rings and he picks it up.He said you knew each other. You weren't sure so you told me to set a meeting. We rescheduled on him four times.I'll charge up the cattle prod.Excuse me, Ms. Mills, risk management needs you right away. The sight of Richard inspires Margaret. She turns to Gilbertson with a wicked grin on her face.Who's getting married?You and him?Assistant.Uh-huh. Margaret smiles and snuggles up to Richard so he can put his arm around her. Richard is truly afraid. RICHARD I'm, uh, marrying my boss? Margaret turns and puckers her lips to let Richard know that she's ready for a kiss. The two slowly begin to come together. Just as their dry lips are about to touch, Richard chickens out and kisses the hair on the top of her head.Plum.No. Plum is \"smokier\" than purple.Tulips. But only when they're in season.Miss Mittens.Nope. Gilbertson smiles and puts down his pad.We are?Sitka.Alaska.Assistant.I quit. Richard leaves Margaret's office. She still has her coffee cup outstretched in her hand.You shut up. You just lost your \"I get to tell Richard what to do\" privileges.You want to talk with me? Fine. Grab your broom and let's go. Margaret is dumbstruck. The receptionist is shocked. The elevator arrives and Richard gets in. Margaret follows. As the doors close, Richard shouts out to the receptionist. RICHARD Watch my phones!Your plan is psychotic.Aren't Canadians supposed to be nice?OK. Fine. Then if we \"make this happen\"? You're promoting me to editor.We go to Alaska and lie to my family? I risk going to jail? Well, you're making me editor for that. I mean, did you think I'd do this out of the kindness of my heart?You know, during my employee orientation, the HR rep didn't mention anything about me marrying you.Nice story Little Orphan Annie, but that sounds like your problem. Not mine. Margaret is stuck. Richard really does have the upper hand.No. But they have huts. Teepees really. And you have to poop in a bucket. But otherwise, just like the Four Seasons. But with bears.Um. Shouldn't we talk about what we're going to say to my parents? Margaret doesn't look up, annoyed with the question.Almost.I told \u00e2\u0080\u0098em we've been dating for six months. We've kept it a secret from everyone... ...and that you're a naughty minx in the sack. Richard and Margaret make it to the attendant at the gate. Margaret is not amused by Richard's attempt at humor.Bringing her home to meet my folks. She'sOK then. You're a sweet lady. Thanks. Richard hustles to the plane as they shut the doors.Hey, he's reading...Oh, you can tell him the truth.That's me. Richard turns to close the overhead compartment.What are you guys doing here? What's with the sign?Didn't tell you what?Uh. Margaret? You need to come over here. Like now. Honey. The Handsome Man sees Richard with the banner people, calling for Margaret to come over. Margaret winces.Everyone, this is Margaret.Now, ah, where did you hear that? The whole \"getting married\" thing?What, ah, did you tell him?No. Really. What did you say?It wasn't a secret. We didn't tell anyone.No, I didn't mean...She's not good with surprises.Come on, it'll be OK. I promise. Richard points to a small island about a mile away.Hey dad. Richard shakes his father's hand. It's a little stiff.You too.Yeah. You'd think you could make it to the airport to mark the occasion. Grandma Annie interrupts.C'mon dad...Don't listen to him, Margaret.Calm down.Hell if I know.You think I'd bring you here if I did?Tell \u00e2\u0080\u0098em what?Wrong answer. No way.No, crazy was lying to the federal officer.Well I'm not making my Gammy an accomplice to a Class C felony! For one second could you not be so selfish?Yeah, you know, that thing you do where you only worry about yourself every second of every day?Look. We're awful, awful people. In the last forty eight hours, we've lied to... everyone. We need to protect the people downstairs. We can't ask these good, decent, not awful people to lie for us. Let's keep the darkside to ourselves. Margaret takes a second to make up her mind.What've I lied to you about?I never said that.When does that come up?Well, maybe I didn't tell you because you would have fired me if you knew.Come on! You're always yammering on about your scrappy childhood, and how you fought for those soccer scholarships, and how the rich kids made fun of you in prep school for working in the kitchen. You're totally anti- rich.Oh yes you are! And you know what makes it worse? You have money!...every penny I have. Blah, blah, blah. You need new material.You were going to promote me anyway.Nope. Not at all. Margaret takes a look at herself in the mirror.Be right back. Richard leaves to fetch lime wedges. Geoffrey elbows Debbie in the side, \"What was that?\"She's been there since she was nineteen.There's some salmon. Margaret shakes her head no. RICHARD Crab? Margaret nods yes. Richard steps away to find a waiter. Geoffrey watches his son do Margaret's bidding.Uh, sure. Honey.Gert!? Richard snaps his arm back, hitting Margaret in the head, and spilling her tonic water on her shirt. He doesn't notice what he's done, and leaves Margaret. She's peeved. RICHARDFrom Chicago? Gertrude laughs. The group watches these two see each for the first time in years. There is instant chemistry, and Richard has forgotten about Margaret completely.You what?Did your husband move up here too?Oh my God. I'm sorry.Well... Richard hasn't recovered from seeing Gertrude. RICHARD Uh, uh, um, I...Uh. Sure.I love you too, Grandma. Grandma hugs the couple. Everyone smiles except Geoffrey and Gertrude.Margaret Mill's phone. One second please. Richard comes back to the group and hands Margaret the phone. RICHARD It's our friend, Frank. Richard's tone let's Margaret know there's a problem.Go where?Um. She's outside. Debbie and Richard turn around and look out a picture window. They see Margaret running with Balzac above her head.What are you doing?Are you drunk?Did the dingo eat your baby, too?Relax. I've got your information backed up on the laptop. I'll just get you a new phone and switch the number. No problem.Now come on. You're going somewhere with my mom and the girls.You want a new phone? You're going.Why's that, Mr. Maguire?Sorry \u00e2\u0080\u0098bout that.You're right. Don't know what I was thinking...That's great for them.Good. Busy. You know.Congratulations.Uh-huh. Geoffrey stops hitting golf balls for a second. He's been thinking about this moment for a long time.Dad. Please. I'm in New York. Margaret's in New York. We have jobs.Again with the secretary thing! I've told you, I'm an assistant!Well if I'm \"just a secretary\", why would you want me up here anyway? Sounds like you're doing great without me.Then how is it? Explain it to me. Geoffrey looks around to see if anyone is listening.This man was a doctor?I'm not sure this is coming out right.Stop being so dramatic.So this is all about what you want?And me in New York with Margaret? That isn't serious?Things change, dad.Things change.Yes. Things change.Nice, dad. We gotta have these Cosby moments more often. This is great. Richard drops his club and walks back to the house.I didn't know you were home! I was outside chopping wood!I had my iPod on!You didn't see me?Wait. Were you tryin' to seduce me?Mmm-Hmmm.Fine. But don't come sneaking in there. You're still my boss. That'd be sexual harassment.It was kinda weird seeing you naked.I'm just saying. It was weird.How was that not weird?We're like teammates?Well, if we're teammates can I sleep in the bed?Margaret?Don't take this the wrong way.You're a very beautiful woman. Margaret smiles with her head turned away from Richard.What the...Come on in mom! Debbie enters with a tray of pastries, fruit and coffee. RICHARD Ah mom, you made your cinnamon rolls.I gotta run into town to get Margaret a new phone.No problem.I wish she hadn't. I mean she almost caught us. Damn, that was close. Like a pig in shit, Richard continues to dig in and doesn't pay attention to Margaret.I'm sorry, what? You gotta try these. Margaret looks at Richard with disgust.Huh?You made me bring you here! You told me IAnd what? Start over at the bottom again? No way.Know what? This is none of your business.You wanna know why you're here? I'll show you why you're here.We leave in a half hour.Yes sir, it is!See ya on the line, Bek Bek.Put this on. I'll meet you outside.Ah. Put it on.You'll thank me later. Richard walks towards the warehouse. Margaret follows in herSo his hands don't go too far. So he doesn't... Richard makes a chopping motion. Margaret winces.Ah, it's been a while.Okay, okay. Richard and Margaret go to the end of the line. Richard expertly demonstrates with a knife. RICHARD You grab a fish, but be gentle, cause you don't want to bruise it. Open her up, tilt the knife, and then pull with the grain of the fish. Two quick stokes to clear the organs attached to the spine.I did this for five summers. Dad wanted me to earn my stripes before I took over.Nah, I loved it here.The slime line? Hell no. Nobody loves the slime line. I loved this place. The people. Growing up, running this place was all I wanted. Margaret scrapes a huge glop of guts out of a fish.I wanted to run this place. It was comfortable here. It was what I knew. Don't forget the spine.But then things changed. And it wasn't so comfortable anymore.Stuff.Yeah... Richard stops, he can tell Margaret knows something. RICHARD Oh my god. She told you didn't she?About the... you know.Ah, shit!OK, get it all out.You done? Margaret nods yes.When Gert crushed my heart into little pieces, a life up here didn't seem so great anymore.At first it was about getting as far away from this place as possible, but then I fell in love with it.With editing. See, as an only kid I'd always read a lot, but until I worked for you I didn't love it. I mean, when I realized that we could find the next Cuckoo's Nest, or Catch 22, or...Exactly! We could find the next To Kill a Mockingbird. God damn, how great is that? Margaret smiles. She never knew that Richard had this kind of passion for the job. RICHARD So when I tell my folks that I want to spend my life finding books? My dad goes ape shit. \"How dare you forsake your family... you'll come crawling back to us... you're nothing without our help.\" I left that night and we didn't talk for a year. Haven't been back here since.No. Margaret gives Richard a disbelieving look. RICHARD Sorta. OK, Yes. Coming back here with you... I get the promotion and I get to show off. You're editor in chief. You make a good prop.So now you know I'm a petty asshole. Am I trustworthy again?Yeah. Thanks.Yes, everyone at work thinks you're a lesbian.I know. Just lashing out. Margaret smiles.Hey Ramone.He was my shop teacher.Like eight thousand? Depends on the time of the year.You got the phone I called about?Thanks, Ramone.It's our stuff.You have no idea.It's our cart. I didn't know you were such a prude.I doubt it. When I started, you were still wearing those Ugg boot things.I'm just saying it's been a long time. I know it all. Margaret turns on her new phone. It searches for a signal.Where?Margaret 1, Richard 0.At Woodstock?What'd they sing again?You had a lot of soul there, Canada.Wow. I'm getting shut out here.Knew that.Huh.Holy shit! You are a lesbian! A MOTHER walking by with her 7 year old gives Richard a nasty look. RICHARD My bad. The mother walks on. Margaret is mortified and walks faster.That's a really long time.I knew it had been slow going, but I figured there was a booty call in there somewhere.I find that hard to believe.I'll have to take your word for it.How, exactly, do you define top notch? Margaret is smiling as she listens to a message on her phone. In an instant, she's all business.C'mon. I got an idea. Richard leads Margaret to the door. As they are leaving Margaret shouts out.Thanks for letting us use your computer.Show me around will you Mrs. Whiting? It's been years.She'll be out of there in two shakes. Out of the corner of his eye, Richard catches Gertrude teaching a class of second graders. He stops transfixed.Uh, sure. Mrs. Whiting leaves. Richard goes to the door and Gertrude sees him. Good lord can that woman smile. She waves him in.Patrick's right. He did smell like eggs.Remember when Mr. Megher made us do this after school for a week?Was not!C'mon! I had the shot. I took it. Gertrude rolls her eyes. She's heard this a hundred times.What? You loved my Top Gun.That's right. Ice... man. I am dangerous. Richard clicks his teeth together, trying to mimic Tom Cruise. Gertrude is not impressed.That cuts deep. I'll have you know thatIt's been awhile, but I can still tell when something's wrong with you. Gertrude doesn't want to say anything. RICHARD What is it? You know I hate it when you get all quiet.Better way to say what?Are you apologizing for high school?Oh, thank God. I thought this was like, something big.I coulda used this about five years ago, but I'm all good now, promise. Thank you for saying that, though. Gertrude sees that Richard isn't getting her point. She pulls herself together.Whoa, whoa, whoa. Rewind.Why are you doing this?No, I don't. I don't know it. Richard begins to pace. Not sure what to say. Every time he opens his mouth, he can't find the words. Then, from the door, an interruption.Uh, you all done?Great. Great.Uh. Yeah. Uh-huh.Nothing. About her school. The kids and stuff. Apparently my second grade teacher was a pot head.Yeah. That was it. You know, I can do this. You should really go try on the dress for my mom.Whatever. Margaret isn't accustomed to Richard talking to her this way, but doesn't push it.I'm a little busy.Go for another run.I'm a little tired of you making demands and me just jumping...OK, high maintenance. Let's go.You don't know where we're going. Margaret opens up the throttle and they are off.The north pole. Congratulations, we made it. It's a glacier. Tracy's Arm. You better let me take it from here.Oh. OK. So like me, you've navigated a lot of glacier fields? And not died? Margaret reluctantly moves aside and lets Richard steer. RICHARD Lady, you've got issues.It doesn't stop there.Oh, please.You drove!Are you kidding me? Richard pulls next to the glacier and turns off the engine.I explained to you...Of course.Like you didn't know.That we were going to lie to them.Well that makes you either stupid, or ignorant.No, but what's behind door number two...Forgot what?What what was like?We need to head back...What? Margaret looks at Richard with a scared and confused look.But...Margaret!Watch your step, OK? It can be dangerous.Margaret? Richard turns around and looks for Margaret. He doesn't see her. He gets out of the boat and goes onto the glacier, walking in the direction he last saw Margaret. RICHARD Margaret? I know I'm breaking \"the rules\" here, but where are you? He takes one more step before he hears...I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just relax. I'll get you out of there. You've broken through an ice bridge. It happens all the time. No biggie.Don't do what?It's not like that. Really. We do need to be careful here though, I don't want us both to fall in. Stay still, OK?So, I'm going to walk up to you and very slowly pull you out. OK?Yeah, that's normal when you're surrounded by ice.So I'm going to pull you up by your armpits. I'm probably going to touch boob. But don't freak out. Margaret shakes her head yes. Richard reaches down and slowly lifts her out of the ice. Margaret doesn't say a word. RICHARD When I get you all the way out, I need you to hold onto me. I'm going to carry you over there. Margaret nods yes as she puts her arms around Richard. He's strong, so it isn't difficult for him to slowly carry her \"over the threshold\" style, away from the hole in the ice. He speaks once they're safe.Yeah. Well. You OK?You woulda laughed at me.Gertrude wants me back. Whoah. Not what she was expecting. She looks down.Well. It seemed like you were having... second thoughts.Maybe we should do it. Come clean.If you do.Where's mom, dad? We all need to talk.What did you do? Geoffrey doesn't answer. He's not proud of himself. RICHARD What did you do, dad?!You made a deal with him? On my behalf?That's none of your business.The hell it is. It is not fine!You do not get to make this decision. This is my decision. The truth is... I've been working for Margaret for three years. Six months ago we started dating. I recently asked her to marry me, and she said yes. See you both atCome on, we gotta get ready. Margaret and Richard storm out of the squash court.What was I thinking? They act like they're nice, but really, they're evil.Are you defending him? Are you defending the king dick?Oh, I've thought about it. And know what I think? I think you saved my life. Thank you, Margaret. Getting married to you is the best thing that's ever happened to me. Without this, I might've ended up back here. Up at the house, Debbie opens the door.Coming mom! Time to sack up. Richard winks and goes inside. Margaret follows, not sure.You look gorgeous.So, is this what you dreamed of when you were a little girl?What are you doing? Margaret gathers herself and turns around to the crowd. They stare back, unsure what to make of this foreigner.Don't do this. Margaret smiles and squeezes Richard's hand.Now wait...So Frank's back in? Margaret nods distractedly. Getting Frank to do the publicity tour doesn't mean much right now.Maybe this'll be your Mockingbird?Great exit back there.Same old, same old, around here.I'll let her know.Don't start lying to me now. Margaret stops for a moment.But... but what about you? What are you gonna do? Margaret wants to keep the conversation short.So what? This is it?Thanks. Richard thanks her with a kiss on the cheek. Then, realizing where and who he is with, he puts his beer down. He turns to Gertrude again with a determined look, gives her a kiss on the lips, then follows it up with an even bigger kiss. When they finish, Gertrude is grinning, eyes closed. Richard looks worried. Something is wrong.Waddya mean?I'm sorry. I'm just a little... confused.You're amazing, Gert. And I've thought about being with you for a long time. A long time. When you said those things at the school? I've dreamed about hearing you say those things.I think I have to find out.If she feels the same way. Gertrude begins to tear up, but won't let herself cry.I'm so sorry.Are you OK?What? Oh. Well, I'm, uh, going to see Margaret.Who you gonna report her to, mom?I don't have the Stockholm syndrome. And she didn't violate me.I'm sorry I lied to you. That was an awful thing to do. But it took this weekend for me to see how funny, and screwed up and perfect Margaret is for me. I think she's... the one.No, I didn't. Not until she left.I don't know. I've got to get to the airport to find out. Debbie doesn't say anything, then breaks into a smile.But I gotta hurry. Her plane leaves any second. I might not make it.I don't have time to explain this to you.I don't care.I don't care. I love you and want you to understand. But I'm not asking your permission here. I'm doing this.I promise, Grandma.The best way?Hey Chuck, it's Richard.Need you to do me a solid, brother. I gotta see my girl and she's on that flight. Could you stop it for me?Oh, c'mon Chuck!Well. That's it. Once she gets back to New York, it'll be like this never happened. Richard looks defeated. Geoffrey sees how sad his son is, and takes a deep breath.You've made that crystal clear.Shit! She's never going to pick up...Excuse me Miss Flight Attendant, could you ask the captain to do me one more favor...Uh, hey Margaret. And cause I'm on the loudspeaker, hey everyone on the plane. The other passengers look around to try and figure out who's Margaret. Meanwhile, Margaret looks down and acts like she doesn't know either. RICHARD This certainly isn't how I wanted to do this. I mean, I'm not really into the whole baring your soul in front of strangers thing, but I figure it's now or never. So here goes.I know you're used to being on your own. And that you're comfortable with your life the way it is. And that in a million years you wouldn't have thought that we should be together. I know, because I felt the exact same way.And you know what else I know? I know that I'm tired of being alone. And I think you're tired of being alone too. So come on. Talk to me. Please. The Handsome Man turns to Margaret.We need to talk.Have you ever thought there might be a reason we've been together for the last three years?Things change, Margaret.Yeah, things change.Now, tell me the truth. When you left, were you relieved or sad that we didn't have an excuse to be together anymore? Geoffrey gives Richard the thumbs up. That was a good one.Because I am sick that you left. And if you feel sick too, then why shouldn't we just be together? Margaret goes to answer, but stops. Richard is right. She wants to go back. Even the passengers on the plane can see it. Gilbertson panics.But it did. Margaret looks down.

Now come on, tell me what I want to hear. Give it to me.You should get paid extra for being so darn funny. Margaret straightens her jacket, answers the phone, and walks out the door. MARGARET This is Margaret.You've been thinking about our talk because I'm right. Everyone does publicity. Roth, McCourt, Russo. Hell, Chabon practically whores himself. Know what they have in common? A Pulitzer. Yes, I know you haven't done it in twenty years, but that's how long it's been since you've written a book this good.I'm not pushing so you'll sell more books, I'm pushing because it'll be a crime if the world doesn't hear that you wrote a genius piece of literature. Do the publicity. Margaret waits for an answer and smiles when she hears \"yes.\" MARGARET You're making the right decision! Great news. Going into an elevator, think I'm going to lose you... Margaret hangs up. Never give them a chance to change their mind.Cancel the call, move the meeting to eight,When I want your praise, I'll ask for it. Is Bob here?We're going to his office. Grab your pad. Richard calmly backs out of the office...That's cute. You gonna call her today?Are you bored here? Do you need little distractions like that to get you through the day?You have another late night out?I'm firing on all cylinders and you've got hearts on your coffee cup, wicked bed head, and a wrinkled suit that you wore yesterday.You'll magically unwrinkle?You have magic pants?Does this work on more than just your pants?Buy me some.I don't care what or who you do on your own time, but when you walk through that door you represent me, and I will not have your personal life affect you at work. If you want me to think of promoting you to editor, I need you sharp, focused and professional. Got it?Great. Now you're just a prop in here, so don't say a word.Hey, Bob.I'm lettin' you go, Bob.You're fired.This isn't working out.I asked you repeatedly to get Frank to do publicity. You said it was impossible.I just talked to him. He's in.No more buts, Bob. I've been chief for a month and a half, and this is the third time you've dropped the ball. You didn't even call to ask him.All you had to do to was pick up the phone. That's it. Now I'll give you two months to find a new job, and then you can say you resigned. I won't tell a soul, my lips are sealed. Margaret nods at Richard and he opens the door.What's he doing? Richard turns around and takes a peek. Bob gets out of his chair and comes to his door.Oh Bob, don't do it...What are you doing? I gave you a civilized way out of this.Oh, Bob. You could never threaten me. I'm firing you because you're lazy, entitled and incompetent. I'm firing you because you don't work hard. So if you know what's good for you, you'll shut up, take off that ridiculous bow tie, find a bar and get drunk. Because if you say one more word, Richard here is going to call security and have you thrown out on your ass. Are we perfectly clear? Bob nods. MARGARET Good. Now I've got work to do, so if you'llI gave you the weekend off?She tell you to quit?Who is this guy?Go get him. But he's out of here in five minutes, we've got work to do. Margaret leaves and goes into her office.Yeah. Well, those announcements are silly, aren't they? Like everyone who needs to know doesn't know already. Margaret has been trying to figure out how she knows this man, but now gives up. MARGARET Have to admit, I can't place where we know each other from. Gilbertson smiles. He didn't expect her to remember.Don't have it...Oh my God, you read that manuscript with me? That book is legend. Without a doubt the worst ever written.It was a fever dream! 900 offensive and pointless pages, with like 30 characters, who all had some weird disability. The paraplegic pornographer, and the stuttering scientist? Oh! And there was the asthmatic alien chapter -- written entirely in his alien language.Did you see the pass letter I wrote him?You wrote the book.You're Dante Dickens?I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. You obviously were spending a lot of time writing, I just thought you should channel all that passion into something else. Gilbertson smiles as he pulls a BADGE from his coat pocket.Excuse me? What? This is a mistake. I've lived here since 1981. I'm applying for citizenship.Yes. And all the papers are in. Gilbertson pulls out a stack of papers and throws them down.I'm a threat to the sovereignty of the United States?\"Affect me at work?\" I'll lose my job!Oh, no. No, no, no. I won't do it.Well then, get it published at another house.All?I'll be fired and laughed out of the industry if I publish that book.I will never publish your book. Ever.This is blackmail. I'll go to your boss.Know what, Dante? I'm not going anywhere! We're getting married! Richard has no idea what Margaret is talking about.We are!Stop playing around, honey. Margaret is all smiles. Richard is very confused. MARGARET Mr. Gilbertson is from the INS. I told him about us. About us getting married.We're in love. We tried to fight it. When it's right, it's right.Nope. True love. Got it bad.Of course we are.What?C'mon. Answer. You don't have a choice. Richard doesn't want to do this, but relents.Are we done here?No one. With us working together we decided it would be too much of a scandal if anyone knew.We're telling his family this weekend.Yes. We are. We're surprising them... ...at his Grandma's 90th birthday party.At Richard's parent's house.In his hometown.Why don't you tell him?Yes. Of course we're going to Alaska. That's where Richard is from. Gilbertson begins to walk around. He's getting worked up.I'm sorry, Dante. Did you not prepare for that? Margaret puts her arm around Richard and waits in silence.There are no \"T's\" or \"I's\" in \"Love\" Mr. Gilbertson. Gilbertson leaves and shuts the door hard. Margaret goes back to her desk like this is all in a days work. MARGARET Why are you from Alaska? Sweet Jesus, that's inconvenient. So here's what's going to happen. We'll play boyfriend and girlfriend this weekend for your parents and that should be enough for this INS interview. Richard doesn't react. Margaret doesn't notice. MARGARET So you need to figure out the travel, schedule a justice of the peace for next week, and get my lawyer on the phone. Margaret takes a sip of her coffee and makes a face. MARGARET But first, run down and get me another coffee from your girlfriend, this is cold. Margaret holds out her coffee cup. Richard doesn't move. MARGARET Hello? Richard? Richard! Richard says his first words since Gilbertson left.Richard, come back here. Margaret tries not to make a scene. MARGARET Richard. Richard. Richard pushes the elevator button in front of reception. MARGARET Come back to the office! Richard can't take it. He gets up in Margaret's face.Well, we need to talk.Well I'd rather poke my eyes out than play pretend girlfriend, but this is the big time. Sometimes you need to sack up.You wanna be an editor? You need to makeI'm doing what?You work for me!Look, I came to this town alone and with nothing. I've worked my ass off for fifteen years and this guy wants to ruin me because he wrote the shittiest book of all time? No way.Fine. You take me to Alaska this weekend, and I'll make you editor. Deal? Margaret puts out her hand to shake, Richard takes it. MARGARET And I'm not sleeping on your parent's hide-a- bed, we're staying in a hotel. Do they even have hotels in Alaska?Are you done with the press release?So what do I need to know up there? Bullet points.I'm sorry, I hate it when people stare at what I'm reading. It's just... I worked on that book.Edited it. It was one of my favorites.You don't see many guys with that book. You, uh, read a lot of love stories about Roman concubines?There you are. Give me my lap top. Richard untangles the bags and gives Margaret her computer bag.I know, Richard. Richard turns around and puts the bags in the overhead compartment. The Handsome Man turns to Margaret.Sit together with who? The Handsome man nods at Richard.You mean him? The Handsome man nods. Margaret tries to set the record straight. MARGARET No. No. No. He's my assistant.Well, he's... indispensable.I have to go now.Have a great life. Margaret walks toward the group. Richard puts out his hand and silently pleads for Margaret to hold it. At the last second, she takes it.Me neither. Debbie picks up some of the bags and starts walking toward the exit. Everyone else follows her lead.Uh, is everyone coming to our hotel?Surprise? Another surprise?I'm really not good with surprises.Are you witches?I'm a lucky woman. Margaret does her best to smile.I'm not getting out of this car until you tell me where we're going.Who are you people? Richard lets Margaret wonder.I thought it was the dragon lady?Uh huh.What a great name. Balzac's \"Lost Illusions\" is one of my favorite novels.Thank you. Where's Richard's room?Oh, let's not upset Grandma Annie.Great. You know, I've gotten used to his breathing at night.I'm about 15 seconds from bitch.What is going on here?You had no idea they knew about us getting married?Well, we just gotta tell \u00e2\u0080\u0098em.Tell \u00e2\u0080\u0098em the truth. About us.What do you mean no way? This is crazy.Well I don't like this.Selfish?How is it selfish to tell the truth?Fine. But if we do this, you need to stop lying to me.Why did you tell me that you were poor?Well, you never told me you were rich.I don't know, how about, \"Hi, my name is Richard, I'm an Alaskan titan of industry.\"No I wouldn't.I'm not anti-rich.I earned...Hey. Watch it. You're still my assistant.Sure of that?Well, come on. If we're going to do this, we might as well put on a show.I went to Union college in upstate New York. It's a small liberal arts school that no one has ever heard of. Richard comes to the group and hands Margaret a drink. MARGARET Lime?Since I graduated college. Richard comes back with the lime. Margaret takes it and doesn't say thank you.Oh, who's counting... Geoffrey could let it go, but wants to push her.Well, let me see. That would be sixteen or seventeen years. Exactly.Just turned thirty seven. Born on May 20th. I'm a Taurus. Geoffrey and Margaret give each other a smile. MARGARET I need some protein.Thank you, honey. You're being so sweet. Richard is surprised, but remembers they're a couple.I'm editor in chief, now. Richard tenderly puts his arm around Margaret.You're a Gertrude?I'm sure it's been a curse.Not exactly...Can I tell this one, honey?I'm an early, early riser and go for a run everyday. Well, it was our six month anniversary and I was out for my normal jog in the park, when who do I see in a horse drawn carriage, wearing a tux, and waiting for me halfway through my run? Richard! So I ran up to the carriage and asked him what was going on, and he put his finger to his lips and says, \"shhhh.\" So there I am in my jogging clothes, next to the most handsome mute in the world - have you seen him in a tux? - riding like a sweaty princess and smiling ear to ear. Couple minutes later, we arrive at Tavern on the Green. Best part, we're the only people in the place because Richard got them to open up early. Well, we go to our table, sit down, and just as the sun starts to peek above the trees, this beautiful man gets down on one knee, and says \"I didn't want one more sunrise to go by without you knowing that you are the light of my life, and that I would be the luckiest man in the world if you would be my wife. Margaret Mary Mills, will you marry me?\" The group is silent, waiting for the clincher. MARGARET I said yes. The group gives a collective \"ahh\". Grandma Annie takes both Margaret and Richard by the hand.Oh please. I'd wonder too. Honestly, my lawyers have been dealing with all of this. When you told us at the airport it was the first time I'd heard about it. I'm so embarrassed.Excuse me, I'll just be a second. Margaret takes the phone and exits out French glass doors that lead to the backyard. She leaves the door open, and doesn't notice Balzac follow her outside.Don't be a cliche, Frank. Don't be the wishy washy writer who changes his mind every two seconds. Margaret notices Balzac, but ignores him. The dog starts YAPPING to get attention. She walks away, but Balzac continues barking. Annoyed, she gets down face to face with the puppy and puts the phone against her chest so Frank doesn't hear. MARGARET Sit and be quiet! Balzac sits and pouts. Margaret walks away and puts the phone back to her ear.This is a delicious dog, Mr. Eagle. C'mon, bring back the phone. Richard calls out from the house.The eagle took my phone!Your dad was right! The eagle tried to take the dog, so I saved it, then it came back and took my phone.Frank's going to call me on that phone. I need it!Oh.I'm not going anywhere.Definitely not a salmon. The women encourage Hank on as he moves Margaret's hands to his wiggling ass and gives her a feel. She can't help but give and embarrassed smile. Finally, the song ends and Hank goes into the splits. Thrilled, the room gives him a standing ovation. Margaret plays along and gives Hank a kiss on the cheek. She begins to get off the stage, but Hank takes her by the hand.What's going on?What's that smell? Margaret finally takes off her blindfold, and finds Ramone about an inch away from her face. MARGARET Ahhh!!! Margaret falls out of her chair and her scream frightens Ramone. After the initial scare he composes himself and wags his finger at her naughty behavior.Good lord.Want me to do it?What? I'm just working on my tan. It's been a long day. Margaret looks inside and sees that the party is still raging.Chicago, right?And now you're back?Really? I don't know. Don't you miss...For you to get divorced?Are we talking about the same guy?Well, Richard's such a player. Gertrude looks confused. MARGARET I mean he was a total player. Before we started dating. Six months ago.That surprises you?We don't really talk much about stuff like that.No, no. Please. I mean, we are getting married. I want to know these things. Gertrude looks down a little embarrassed.I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... He proposed to you in high school?You must have...I would hope so.I'll be right in. Margaret smiles and turns to the ocean. Gertrude goes inside. Then, to herself, Margaret silently whispers. MARGARET We are awful people.I am so tired. Balzac GROWLS when he hears Margaret's voice. He's still mad. Margaret just smiles. MARGARET Think I'm going to take a shower and clean off Ramone's bubble gum body oil. Thanks for a great night. Annie and Debbie smile graciously and wish her good night. Once she's gone, they turn their death stare back to Geoffrey. He looks genuinely unnerved.Richard, is that you?Richard, are you... Then out of nowhere, Balzac startles Margaret.I'm sorry bout the eagle. But I saved you. Balzac won't listen to reason and barks angrily. Margaret grabs the ceramic top of the toilet tank to protect herself.Will you just hand me a towel! Richard looks for a towel, but forgets he's naked. When he looks under the bed, Margaret shrieks and covers her eyes.. MARGARET You're flashing brain! Richard quickly changes positions. Out of desperation, he pulls the entire comforter off the bed. He throws it Margaret's way, and she wraps herself in it.You didn't hear me?I didn't jump you. I didn't mean to jump you. I didn't know you were here.I was running from the dog! Richard looks at Margaret suspiciously.Oh please! Don't flatter yourself.Go take a shower. You stink.I'm never gonna to get to sleep. Richard pushes a button and motorized metal blinds come down outside the window. The sunlight is instantly blocked out and the room is pitch black. MARGARET Oh. Well. Thanks. Richard settles into his pathetic excuse for a bed. The two silently lie awake and stare at the dark ceiling.Can we not talk about this?It wasn't weird.Because we're... like teammates.We are teammates. And teammates see each other naked in the locker room. All the time. It's not a big deal.Good night, Richard. The two lay awake in silence for another beat.Yes?Okay...Get some sleep Richard, big day tomorrow.Who is it?You don't have to go to all this trouble. Really. Debbie sweetly looks back at Margaret.You just take all this for granted? Your family, this house... Richard takes another big bite and turns to Margaret.Why are you doing this to them?Why am I here? You didn't have to bring me here.I didn't make you do anything. You could of said no.I get why a not rich person would do this. But you've got everything. It doesn't make any sense.I wish it wasn't my business. But unfortunately, it has become my business, because I made a deal with someone I thought I could trust. Richard stares at Margaret for a beat. He's exasperated.Fine.I'll be ready in 20 minutes. Margaret angrily takes a bite of a cinnamon roll and slams it down on the plate. She goes to her suitcase and looks for clothes. A beat passes, and she comes back to the rolls. MARGARET These are really good. She takes a cinnamon roll and leaves.That's great to hear.But I don't...Is this really necessary?Why is he handcuffed to the machine?Nice. From the decapitator, fish are fed into the gut puller, where their bellies are slit and the intestines are pulled out. MARGARET You know, I shouldn't be here. I was a vegetarian for six months in college. Richard leads Margaret to the end of slime line, where a long line of 20 workers give the fish a final cleaning before they are frozen. With great speed, they take the fish from the gut puller line and clean out all the left over intestines.Gimme that. Up to the challenge, she takes the knife and grabs a fish. Margaret puts the knife in and keeps as much distance as possible between her and the salmon.Is that why you're still pissed at him?You loved this?I wasn't gonna forget. Margaret squeezes the blood out of the vein, sends the fish on its way, and grabs another fish with more confidence.What kind of things changed?You mean, like, Gertrude?The creepy teenage proposal?You were a freak by the way.And she was right to break up with you.For a little while? Don't sell yourself short.So you moved to the open arms of New York City?With scheduling my pilates?...To Kill a Mockingbird. It's all about To Kill a Mockingbird.So we're \"getting married\" so you can give daddy the finger?Oh yeah, we're good. By the way, you're more screwed up than I am, Paxton.One more question...That wasn't my question.Can we stop gutting fish? I need my phone.Of course he was. How many people are on this island? They start to fill their cart with cases of champagne.Feels smaller. With the cart full they head to the checkout.Why's Ramone letting you steal his stuff?That must have been handy in High School.Should you leave the cart?I've come to realize that being my assistant gave you more access to my life than I ever imagined, but there are a few things you don't know about me.I told you never to talk about that.Did you know I took disco lessons in the sixth grade?The Y.Uh, my first concert was Kool and the Gang.I won tickets on the radio and saw them at the fair.You know.I really like \"The O.C.\". Not fake, ha, ha isn't it funny I like this trash. I really like it.Allergic to pine nuts.Afraid of penguins.Haven't slept with a man in a year and a half.Kool and the Gang gets nothing, but that gets a Holy shit? I've been busy!That hurts coming from Mr. Magic Pants.Yeah, well, I'm not good at that.No, not that. I'm great at that. Aces. Top notch.Yes. You will.I need a computer and the internet. Now.No, no, no. I need on now. I've got a Booker prize winning author demanding I send him an e-mail in the next forty five minutes explaining why he should stay with a publishing house that \"makes\" him do publicity. The Pirate looks at Margaret like she's speaking Chinese.Listen to me asshole... The Pirate looks around to make sure his boss can't hear.I didn't know there were a lot of pirates in Alaska!I'm sorry, but could I have a minute aloneHey guys. Holy shit. Did Margaret hear anything? Her face gives nothing away. Gertrude and Richard act like nothing just happened, but look guilty as hell.Yeah. We'll see what he says.You ready to get back to the house?Well let's go. See you at the wedding, Gertrude. Gertrude just smiles.So, what did you and Gertrude talk about? Richard lies.That was it? I was gone for awhile...I was going to go for a run first, it's been three days since I got out, I'm feeling crazy.What now? Margaret follows the smoke, and hears a mysterious DRUMBEAT. She soon discovers a tremendous bonfire by the water, and a SHAMAN dancing around it. He is dressed in a loin cloth, and wears a carved bear's head mask and tribal make up. His belly shakes as he spastically moves around the fire. The Shaman sings a song that sounds centuries old.What, ah, are you doing?Ya know, I've got to get back.I'm a big fan of the nest. Geoffrey throws sand into the fire and it blazes higher.OK, OK. I \"accept your circle.\" Geoffrey smiles and throws more sand into the fire.I'm gonna head back.I think I am. Margaret begins to leave. Geoffrey calls after her.Me what?Chant what?I can't...I don't know any chants!He told me I had to chant!Just buttoning up here.Yeah, it's a little snug.It's beautiful.How'd they stay together?No, no, no. I can't. Really.Well. Thing is... Margaret deliberates spilling her guts to Annie, but can't. MARGARET ...the dress is just a little tight.We need to talk.Well I'm freaking out. I need to get away from here. From everyone. Now.No! I did that. It did not help.We're not going to need any of this if I don't get out of here.Move over, I'm driving. Margaret cuts in front of Richard and grabs the wheel.It doesn't matter.I'm fine.Yeah. I'm a control freak. Fine.This coming from the sociopath.I'd never bring me here.I mean to Alaska.You're sick. Doing this to them.They love you. Do you get that?And you're still willing to lie to them?Didn't know what?I didn't know!You think I'm stupid?What it was like!To have a family! I forgot what it was like to have a family. I've been on my own since I was thirteen, and I'd forgot what it was like to have people that love you, and make you breakfast, and give you necklaces...Alone. I need alone time.I'm, uh, about to lose my shit. Big time. I need a second.No talking!Again, you're not supposed to be... Margaret doesn't finish her sentence.Don't do that.The thing that doctors do in E.R. when they tell the gunshot victim who is bleeding to death that they're going to be OK. Don't do that!Uh-huh. Richard is ten feet away from Margaret now. He's checking the ice to see if it is stable. He slowly walks her way.I'm really cold.You said it was \"no biggie\".Yeah. I'm fine. Richard smiles. Margaret smiles back. Richard walks very comfortably with her in his arms. She fits just right. Margaret looks up to Richard gratefully. MARGARETYeah. While I was getting my camera. The two stare at each other for a beat. There's a real spark. They might kiss.And?Yeah. I was.Put me down. Richard puts Margaret down near the boat. She tries to regain her composure. MARGARET You wanna call it off?Fine. It's over. We'll tell them when we get back.It's fine.It's OK. Tell him.He's only doing it because he loves you.Just stop. Think about this.Matches the shoes. Margaret pulls up the dress to reveal running sneakers.Nice song. Richard shrugs his shoulders.I guess so. Margaret and Annie stop at the end of the aisle. Looking up, Margaret sees the justice of the peace, Ramone.Oh, you bet. They make it to the Gazebo, where Ramone awaits. MARGARET Ramone.No.I have something to say. It's not a question though.Uh. Um. No.Hey there, folks. Thanks for coming out. I've got a little announcement to make about the \"wedding.\"Not sure the best way to tell you all this. But, uh... I made Richard marry me. This is all a sham. Gilbertson victoriously pumps his fist in the air.Richard. Please. Let me finish. Richard wanted to stop this when we got off the plane, but I wouldn't let him. Don't blame him. This is all my fault. Could you get the band started? And give these people something to drink. And you. Meet me at your dingy in ten, you're taking me to the airport.Take care of him.Uh-huh. Yeah. That's great Frank. Good news. Talk to you on Monday. Margaret hangs up.Yup. He's in. For now.Yeah. Right. Margaret starts collecting her bags.Thanks. Fun weekend.Wasn't sure if your mom would want me to strip the sheets, so I just left them.It was getting too messy. We weren't going to be able to keep it up.I heard you and Gertrude at the school. I think she meant what she said. She's a great girl, you should stay. It's the right thing. You're perfect for each other.Don't worry about me. I'll survive.Yup. This is it.I'm not doing great in the dignity department, can we not do this right now?I'll publish your book. Gilbertson smiles.Yes, of course. She unbuckles her seat belt, about to get out of her seat.Tell him I'm not here.Oh, good lord.What the hell are you doing? Everyone in the tower smiles. They're making progress.About what?As boss and assistant.Is that the best you got? Geoffrey hits Richard, as if to say \"see, that's what I said.\" Richard composes himself.What's your point?This wasn't supposed to happen. Richard looks Margaret in the eye.I'm not the kind of girl who gets saved. Richard smiles, and without warning, Margaret grabs him, and plants a long, deep, and wet kiss on him. The long kiss is interrupted by the Handsome Man and Gilbertson.Hey! Do you think getting arrested might affect you at work?

We've heard a lot about you. All of it bad. Margaret tentatively walks off the yacht in her none to practical sling backs. GEOFFREY I mean, I almost shit myself when I heard he was marrying the devil woman.Either way.Welcome home. Good to see \u00e2\u0080\u0098ya.Been a while.And don't let him outside, or the eagles will snatch him.I mean it. They come out of that rehabilitation center mean. And hungry.Nineteen? Wow. That's how long?No. How many years is that? Exactly. Margaret gives Geoffrey the slightest look.I was never good with big numbers. That makes you... thirty six now?Keep him on a short leash, huh? Does he roll over when you whistle? Debbie hits Geoffrey.Gert and Richard were quite the item in high school. Gertrude instantly dismisses Geoffrey's reminiscence.Feels like yesterday to me.Yeah. How did you pop the question? Richard is a deer in the headlights. This is getting ugly. Margaret sees that Richard is going to crumble, and steps in.So did this happen before or after the INS agent came sniffing around?...yeah, Debbie found these eco-balls that dissolve in the water.She just does. I stopped trying to figure out how. Geoffrey and Mr. Maguire see Richard coming their way. Mr. Maguire yells at Richard like the old family friend he is.Maguire's stepping down in January. He's, uh, handing things over to Matty. Richard gives his dad a look. He knows where this is going.So. How's work with you?I do. I do. Hey, did I tell you that we're opening a little office in Japan?We're not just a mom and pop operation anymore. We're going global.I could really use your help.I know. I know. It's just...You're only a secretary. This pisses Richard off immediately.Just because you call yourself an \"assistant\" doesn't mean you're not really just a secretary.It's not like that and you know it.Last week, a man stuck his finger up my butt......and it got me thinking about you.Just shut up for a second, okay? I want you to have what I built. But I'm running out of time to show you things.I'm not being... I need you to stop dicking around down there and get serious.That's not what I said.One day the woman is the Antichrist, and the next day she's the love of your life? How is that serious?Things change?Things change. That's your explanation? Know what I think? I think you banged your boss and fell in love, that's what I think. Some sorta mommy complex.Excuse me? I'm watching that.Nothing. I didn't do anything... will you please move. The showdown intensifies. Margaret excuses herself.Stop looking at me like that!Yes. Mr. Gilbertson? My name is Geoffrey Paxton... Only the animal trophies that adorn Geoffrey's office hear the rest of the conversation.My shaman Kevin told me to get out here and clear my head. As you know, things have been a little crazy around here. You should join me.You closed minded southerners amuse me. Never willing to leave the nest and tryDance with me! You besmirch my ways if you deny my circle. Worried she's going to really piss him off, Margaret relents.Clear your mind and follow me. Geoffrey begins dancing slowly, contorting his body. Margaret follows, always a half step behind, and can't get into it. After a few moments, Margaret stops.We're not done.Margaret? Margaret stops and turns around. GEOFFREY I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot. But I'm making an effort here. Don't leave now. Much to her chagrin, Margaret stays. Geoffrey is pleased. GEOFFREY Thank you. Yai...takuju magaluam Ut uksu lingm ik pifiksailiriju m 1k... Geoffrey throws more sand on the fire to make it go higher and speeds up the dance. Margaret is getting better, but it is still painfully awkward.Chant.Whatever comes out, just chant. It is the way. You'll feel better.Close your eyes. Chant. Margaret and Geoffrey keep dancing. Margaret closes her eyes, but can't figure out what to say. GEOFFREY Chant!Chant!Chant! The drum beat continues.Oh Debbie, I didn't do anything. Margaret sees Debbie and Grandma Annie in the clearing.Don't make fun of my heritage! And it was helping. Don't you feel better? I feel better.Fine. With a fire extinguisher, the bonfire comes to an end.Come with me.Not now. C'mon. Richard and Margaret look at each other, not sure what to do. Geoffrey storms off and they follow.I haven't told your mother about any of this, and I don't plan to. I was really beginning to like you. Sorry about this. Geoffrey opens the door and goes inside.I called him yesterday. He told me that you were lying, and that he was going to catch you. That he was going to send you to prison.You were making a mistake...What are you doing, Richard?What are you so God damn happy about?What?!Are you buying this horse shit?Well then make some god-damn time. Cause I won't let you throw your life away for some woman.Excuse me?Oh, really? From behind them, Annie stands up and shouts.Mom, are you OK?Richard! She has something she wants to say to us! Richard leans down, and joins Geoffrey and Annie. Their three heads are very close together. Annie speaks to them both through the oxygen mask.I... I promise.What... what is going on? Did you fake a heart attack?So, you know I think you shouldn't be with Margaret, right?Good. Well, consider this me keeping my promise. Geoffrey pulls out his cell phone and hits a button. He waits for an answer. GEOFFREY Hey! Maguire! Yeah, yeah, yeah, her running out was something. But that's what I'm calling about.
