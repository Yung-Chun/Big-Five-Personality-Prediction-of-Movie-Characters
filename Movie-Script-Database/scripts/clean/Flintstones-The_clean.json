{"Flintstones-The": {"FRED": {"raw_line": "Wil-ma. Wil-ma? How about a great big good morning kiss for your Freddy-weddy? And he pulls the covers down to reveal -- DINO, who is immediately \"YI-YI-YI-YI-ING,\" hopping all over the bed and showering Fred with sloppy kisses.Dino! Dino, cut it out -- !Dino, that's enough -- here, look, Daddy has a nice dino bone for you, just please stop it --Oooh, Dino, look -- there's a nice big dino bone laying out on the front lawn -- !-- Gosh, look at that adorable little female dino ---- That animal's gonna kill me with kindness. Do you know we're out of dino treats?And what's wrong with my leftovers?That's right, sweetheart. The only thing that's gonna eat you up is -- me!Pebbles, don't worry. These stories are very exaggerated. Like, you know, the boogyman? There's no such thing as a huge, inhuman reptile that attacks without warning -- WHAM! Dino reappears, bounding through the window and knocking Fred onto the floor. Once again Dino is happily licking and loving and cuddling his callously unresponsive owner. Fred struggles to avoid the slurping tongue, pulls himself up to the window sill, looks out.-- Oh, look, everybody, the mailman is here --Thanks, Wilma... Fred slaps jelly on the toast, takes a big bite, and then something outside the window catches his eye.Arnold! Arnold! Don't aim at the house -- please, not at the house -- WHAM! Fred ducks back just as the stone newspaper slams into the window frame, SMASHING a FLOWERPOT, taking out a chunk of wall, and continuing diagonally through the kitchen and out another window. Fred follows this action in time to see -- HIS DRIVEWAY - THROUGH THE OTHER WINDOW The rock paper drops like a foul shot, rips through the canvas roof of Fred's car, and then bangs a huge dent in the hood.Yeah. What else can go wrong?'Bye, little sweetheart. 'Bye, big sweetheart.What's nice about it?This is the third ragtop this year ... say, shouldn't you be at work?You got fired, didn't ya?Yeah, I know, I know, those crazy inventions of yours. Be honest with me, Barn... tell me one thing you invented that really caught on.You invented fire?Yeah, but did any one of them ever put bread on the table? How long are you and Betty gonna live on those penny-ante royalties you get?If you ask me, pal, you're just blowing smoke up your own volcano...Two coo-coo berries? You made of money, Barney?Barney, why don't you try inventing a brain for yourself! Look at what you did to --Okay, you fixed a dented hood. But you call that a living? Face it, pal, this is the Stone Age, and it's a dino eat dino world. You want my advice?You stick with me today, cruise on down to the quarry and fill out a job application. I'm a big man there, Barney --I'm serious, pal. Me and Mr. Slate are just like this -- He takes his hand off the wheel to hold up two fingers... ends up swerving instead.-- just like that. I know, I know -- you're not a clock-punching guy -- but face it, Barney -- it's time to grow up and put your nose to the grindstone, batten down the hatches and join the ratasaurus race with the rest of us. It's time to retire those dreams. Barney looks glum, doesn't say anything. Suddenly Fred pulls over, stops the car.Barney. Look.Remember the old days, Barn? We used to race our go-carts here to impress the girls.Hey. Since when do I have to be consistent?Sergeant Feldspar, I... I wasn't speeding... honest...Well, Sergeant, if you don't have a radar reading, I guess we'll -- -- justbeonourway -- !Barney, you won't regret this -- hiya, Al -- fixing dents in cars is one thing, a career's another. Here, you're getting in on the ground floor of the first footstep of a new leaf -- hi, Wally, how's the old backhand? And with a guy like me ta show you the ropes, you can skip all the red tape, all the malarky, all the dino doo --Hiya, Shirley. This is my very special neighbor and pal Barney Rubble. He needs an application form, okay?My pleasure, Shirl. Anytime.No problem. Fred smiles at her, hands the forms to Barney. Fres steps towards the quarry, admires the activity, hands on hips, master of all he surveys. He waves to more friends.Well, Barn, what did I tell you? When you're in with Flintstone, you're in like Flint.Not again... Fred hustles up a ladder to a ramp which leads him up to the level of Piltdown's cab. Barney hurries to follow.All right, Piltdown, that's enough! You're endangering your fellow workers!Says me, Fred Flintstone -- shop steward of Amalgamated Neolithic Workers 101.Whoa, whoa, big fella -- He calms the beast by giving it a carrot. As it munches, Fred quickly ties the reins to a post.You're on report, Piltdown! If it's up to me you'll be pushing a wheelbarrow!Fat butt? Hold me back, Barney -- -- Barney, hold me back -- Quickly the men form a circle around Piltdown and Fred. Barney looks up and sees -- THE CRANE ON THE DINO'S BACKYeah. That's right. I mean -- this ain't over, Piltdown. Come on, guys. Let's clean up the mess. With much grumbling, ropes and grappling hooks are gathered and the crew hops to it...Barney! Grab that line! Hurry! Barney scrambles up Fred's back, shoving a foot in Fred's face, but finally snatching the rope. He pulls on it... Fred throws his own weight into the effort...Oh boy. Goodbye pension fund -- They rush for the office building.Barney, shut up -- Mr. Slate -- Mr. Slate -- are you all right? Slate staggers to his feet, seething with fury. He finally yanks the car hood free. It bounces and VIBRATES in his hands like a hand saw.Oh, it's ah, just something I whipped up in the old garage workshop -- -- with a little help from my buddy Barney, right, Barn?Well, Mr. Slate, I call it -- -- Barney, what do I call it?-- I call it Fibrerock Fred -- ! I mean, ah, 'Fibrerock'!Just be thankful I was there to go over the fine print. It's like I told you this morning -- There's something noble about a man digging in with his hands and doing an honest day's work. Once you file those dreams under 'old business' and put your nose to the plow, well, the world is your oyster. And was I right?Details, Barney, details... I just can't wait to see the girls' faces when we tell 'em the news... INT. FLINTSTONE HOUSE - NIGHTWhy? Oh, me and Barn, we suddenly realized that we had a little spare change.Noogy, noogy, ha, ha -- !Ready when you are. Hey, '1'... a good year.We see your dollar signs, ladies... and...... we raise them.You bet they're real, sweetheart. They're as real as... as... well, as real as -- -- the best darn friends and neighbors in the whole world.Right, pal o'mine. As they laugh and the girls slowly absorb the truth, we --Brother Buffaloes, honored Herdmaster, Junior Bucks and Apprentice Antlers, a great good evening to you all. Ahem. As you know, our organization has survived difficult times that have seen the extinction of such other lodges as the Order of Whooping Cranes and Brotherhood of Giant Sloths. But we here have come through the croo ... the crux...-- crucible with our fur fluffy and our hooves unscathed. Now, the future holds many promises and many problems. As your next Herdmaster, I would bring to you the same determination, courage and -- if I may say so -- bold thinking that I have brought to the workplace. Thank you, and ack ack a-dack. Applause follows Fred's return to the floor.Hey, when you're hot you're hot... boys, lemme buy a round of drinks for everyone.But the principle is the same, Barn. Don't forget that. Fred leads the group over to the bar. Piltdown and Pyrite come along with a shrug... why not, for a brew? Fred reaches --Here you go, boys, nice and frosty...Well, here's to...Aw, gee, Barn... you shouldn't say that... ... at least not till after next week's election!Well, Harry, it just so happens that old Fred is moving up in the world... Boys, you're looking at Mr. Slate's new partner.Prepare to eat those words, Piltdown.Gentlemen, my card -- He passes them out, and the others take them, curious --Barney, it's all part of the plan. Yes, boys, you see, I went up to my pal, Mister Slate and single- handedly made him an offer he couldn't refuse ---- 'Freddy boy,' he sez to me, 'We gotta talk turkey -- 'That's right -- just like that --Ah, excuse us, boys...Barney, we could tell everyone how you invented this Fibrerock stuff, how Slate and Lava found out about it by accident and all, but what would that be?This is big business, Barney. We can't start telling the truth, it'd create the wrong impression. Think about all the really big deals in history -- back to the beginning of recorded time. Barney knits his brow in thought for maybe three seconds.What do they all have in common? I'll tell you. A front man. A guy who's out in the public eye running the point, fighting the crowds... and meanwhile... back in the corner is the silent partner.That's because the silent partner is always silent.But while you're busy being silent -- -- all along you're the brains behind the operation and I'm the brains in front of the operation. I'm out here running the guts of the operation but you got a cut. It looks like my mind, but you're really behind.Attaboy! And a confident Fred shakes hands with an unsure \"silent partner\"... CUT TO:is at the car door, lunch pail in hand, when Wilma calls out to him.Yeah... it does feel a little light... He returns to her, opens the pail, is surprised to find it's empty. Before he can comment, she smilingly presents him with a spanking new briefcase. \"F.F\" is embossed on it in gold.Aw, Wilma... lookit, it's got buckles, a strap, a lock -- He opens it. Inside is a huge drumstick and some ribs.-- Baby, you're the greatest.I'm already taken. He moves to the car.Ah, Mister Rubble, I presume? Of the Fibrerock Rubbles?Yas, yas. The water was too deep and my horse drowned. They crack up at their own wit, drive off.Gets the old adrenaline going, Barn. Us big executives, we need that kind of jolt to get the old wheels turning.Hey. What's going on?Yes, yes. Quick, dynamic entry into the marketplace. I approve.Hey, you're right... ... Big business is hell, Barney. Trust me... you'll get used to it.Welcome to the top -- partner.I do? I mean, I do, yeah!Mr. Slate -- we gotta talk --About those guys outside, Mr. Slate. Some of 'em, well, they been here for years. And you, well, you can't lay them off just like -- -- that!Oh, you can, huh?Me! Ah, ha, that's rich, Mr. Slate, that's -- Suddenly Fred stops laughing.Uh... well, gee, I... uh, yeah.Akkk... something... noble... man ... job... nose... wheel... shoulder... grindstone... hommm... yggggg...Since when do you have to prepare for a landslide, right, guys?Barn -- w-what's going on?Guys, guys, come on now -- what's a quarry fulla layoffs got to do with a lodge fulla Buffaloes?Fellas, come on. We're all big boys here -- He gestures vaguely towards the outside world, then back to the little band of brothers here.Surely we can separate in our minds work, and play... Job, and Lodge...Wait, wait... Your Antlerness, please, one second -- ! Fred grabs Barney by the shoulder, spins him around, pushes him forward like a refrigerator on a dolly, stands him up center stage.Barney, you gotta tell the other guys what really happened. Tell 'em the story behind Fibrerock. The true story. The room quiets. Barney clears his throat. Fred waits, hopeful.No, no, the rest --!Big deal, after you screwed everything up in the first place...! Barney reacts, really hurt. He moves away on the bench. Fred's so agitated he doesn't even realize it.No kidding. They rejected the best candidate --Oh, no! That -- that's horrible! We could end up with half a percent of nothing!Oh, yeah, yeah, that, too... come on, Barn, we gotta stop 'em! CUT TO: EXT. SLATE QUARRY - NIGHT Silent, empty. CAMERA PANS FROM the still yard TO the gate. Down the road, we see Piltdown leading the angry mob. Quickly, they go to the gate, climb up and over it!I don't believe this... how did things ever get this out of hand -- ?Well, I wouldn't go that far... Suddenly they're interrupted by the sound of a SIREN. Fred looks back and sees --Oh, no, not now... Feldspar signals Fred onto the shoulder. Fred smiles, nods...Barn! Did you see that -- ? -- Huh, now it's gone... I coulda sworn...Brother Piltdown... can we talk about this, antler to antler?Guess not... Fred inches down the shuddering beam, jumps off. Freed of Fred's weight, the other end \"BOINGS\" down on Piltdown's head. He groans, recovers in time to chase after Fred.Is backpedaling away from Piltdown on the upper super- structure of the assembly line. Fred scrapes one foot in an arc in front of him.Dare you to cross that line.That line.is flung to the conveyor belt, stiffly caked in clay. THE FIBRE MOLDI don't wanna talk about it. Besides, who cares about a bunch of jerks running around with furs on their heads? I'm more of a country club guy myself anyway...... But Barney doesn't want to take a vacation -- he says he's gotta be here to check up on the Fibrefoam --Of course not, Mister Lava. But --Why, yeah, sure, Jerry.Well, actually, I wouldn't say small part... I'd say...... Kind of a medium-sized... well, almost medium-sized... well, really a semi-partial assistant counsulting type, of --Well, gee, that's tough one -- -- Uh, what are my important duties?R-rockin' Leach? Indeed, it is he, and he smiles, extends his hands.M-me? On -- on television?Barney who?W-what's wrong?Maybe you could move those plants to block them out...?It's the Rubble yard, Wilma. It's just not the right image... He starts away, suddenly notices his own barbecue and trikes... quickly, without missing a stride, he tosses a tarp over them, slides a potted plant over for good measure. BARNEY AND BETTY'S HOUSE - SAME TIMEWell, Rockin', you're right, I have affected destiny for all mankind, and it's a sobering thought. However, if I may add a personal note at this time, I myself cannot personally take all the credit for Fibrerock...Hello, hello. Bon soir. Good to see ya... glad you could make it...Fred -- there's the bar, make yourself at home -- mi casa es votre casa, so, when in Rome and all that --You mean you can see their house -- ?Wilma, I'm shocked. I wouldn't do that. Okay, I admit it: I'm trying to make an impression here, I wanna look good, I wanna be a success...... But deep down inside, I'm still the same lovable guy you married -- -- Frederick von Flintstone the third --What'd I say?In the middle of a tight little group which is pigging out. Fred seems oblivious to the fact that they're oblivious to him.... Yas, yas, it's a challenging commodity market these days. Personally, I'm considering petrified forests, but they do say that volcano futures are ready to explode, ha, ha...... Hey, whoa, what's happening --Fred! He stumbles through the thinning crowd, clutching at elbows.Hey, what's the hurry? We got a cake shaped like a piece of Fibrerock... I got it, how about some charades? No, even better, twenty questions: 'Am I animal, mineral, or fossil'...? Oh, I heard a great one the other day ... a guy walks in a bar with a duckasaurus on his head and the bartender says -- this'll kill you, the bartender says -- Fred stops, running out of steam along with his moment of glory. He stands alone on the lawn. Wilma slowly comes up to him.Whaddya mean, not working out? They're goin' party hopping, that's all. That's what ya do in society, Wilma... you cruise around. They'll go over to Slate's shindig for a while, then they'll come back here.You go on over to Slate City, okay?Nah, me and some of the guys from the country club, we're gonna play poker, yeah, big stakes poker until everybody comes back. Go on with the others. The kids got their show to put on anyway... and I wouldn't want people to think... to think the Flintstones were party poopers.Just you and me now, Dino. Yeah. That's okay. Man and man's best friend.His anger spent, he stands panting, splattered with dirt... then he sees -- NEW ANGLE - ANOTHER DIRT-COVERED FIGURE -- standing in the ruins of the wall. The figure sneezes, whacks dirt off of itself. It's --B... Barney?'Pal'? How can you call me that? Barney, I... I've been such a... such a... such a...Well, yeah. But more of a --Well --Barney... can... can you ever forgive me for being such a jerk?Aw, Barn... And he grabs Barney in a big bear hug. Tears in both their eyes, they slap each other on the back, two prehistoric sensitive guys. CUT TO:Boy, those were the days, Barney. Bedrock High winning all those games... and you and me right in the middle of it.So what? We made the team spirit. That's just as important... whatever happened to those cheerleader costumes?Boy. Talk about memories. Fred tosses the cheerleader sweater to Barney, who grins, pulls it on. Fred also starts to get into his old \"uniform,\" but has to suck his gut in mightily. Finally, he can zip it up, stern to stem.Back then, we thought a pop quiz was a big problem. We didn't know how good we had it. No problems, no worries...What for? So him and all his fancy friends can look down their noses at us?All they've been doing is using us, Barney. And meanwhile ---- Meanwhile all the time they were laughing at us.About an hour ago.Wha... what's happening?Your old models are just fine...What's it?But.. why would ---- Not 'somebody' -- Lava!Then... what's happening here...Oh no... Barney! Wilma and Betty -- and the kids -- they're all there -- With a final WHIMPER, the little FIBRESPHERE CAVES IN and then the nearby SLATE NEEDLE CRUMBLES, model story by model story. Finally the \"DISK\" on top of the needle is all that's left, wobbling around like a spun dinner plate. It finally falls... EXPLODES.-- B-barney... what do we do?What'll we do when we get there?Barney -- ! -- I can't see straight --Ho, gweat! Hoo bwoke hit, Bahnee! Hi khnat twalk hennymore! Suddenly both men react to an approaching SIREN. They both look back at --Ho noh! Ahhrisser Felghspah! Haybee whee hould shtop -- ?'Hen yore height, yore height... Fred pours on more speed. They careen around a turn. CAMERA WHIP PANS TO a road sign: SLATE CITY--1 MI.'Ood hidea. Ood whuk, ol' bhudee. They slap hands together like basketball players, then head off in two directions.Offisser Fledapar, het me hexpwain -- his howse hiss maid uv fibahwock -- He reaches out to tap the nearby wall and -- WHAM -- it collapses all around him, leaving a gaping hole in the house!Nogh, wate, chum baggk -- As Fred \"roars\" and moves forward, Feldspar and Gravel scream, panic, and run!Tries to catch up and collides with the already damaged house. It collapses totally, falling in on itself, obscuring Fred. Finally the last TIMBER DROPS. Pause. Fred staggers out of the rubble, realizes that the impact has knocked the monster mask off his head and back on its hinges. He rubs dust out of his eyes, turns and looks at the Slate Needle. He's much closer to it now.Barney! The elevator -- !Quick! Use your coo-coo gun -- !It's real simple, Mister Slate. Your boy Lava here has been stealing the coo-coo berries from the Fibrerock mix and fixing the books to hide it!Now I remember! These guys were pulling this xenosaurus act that night at the plant! What's this, Lava... 'Plan B'?Y-yeah. Everything's gonna be just -- Whoa, hoo-hah, aggh ---- Wait a minute -- I don't feel anything at all --Hist hust fine! He lowers his head, runs through the fire, which licks at him harmlessly. Then with his claw, he SMASHES the amber GLASS --Hit fuzz nudding... wheely... The pythonsaurus looks around at the attention.Upsy-daisy, sweetheart -- piggy back time! She jumps on his back... slamming the monster head back in place.Hohh...

He's slightly stunned, still in the suit. He sits up... suddenly lights snap on all around him! Fred looks up and sees -- HIS POV - CORDON OF POLICE OFFICERSHigh ham noght a zenosore! High ham hay hooman beeng -- ! BAM! WHAM! KABAM! Bullets and projectiles begin slamming all around Fred! He ducks behind a big fallen chunk of Fibrerock -- catches his breath as the bullets and shells bounce off its resilient surface. CLOSE - FRED Momentarily safe, he tries desperately to remove that stupid head -- bangs it against the wall, tears at it with his claws -- -- meanwhile, the chunk of Fibrerock protecting him decomposes! He's back in the line of fire! DINOBarn...? What's going on?Dino kibble...? Disbelieving, Fred moves over to the happily-munching animals. He has to get on his knees to wiggle in with the pack. He grabs some, stuffs it in his mouth... chews. His eyes widen...Dhinough khibble!! He spits it out, takes out the chunk of contract Slate wrote on.Barney, we -- we're rich!

For ma petite Pebbles.It's not like the boys to be so late.Betty, sometimes you're a little too gullible --No kidding. Do you have any idea of what the enrollment fee is? And get this... it's non-refundable --Oh, she was getting to me too with all that mastodon snort about her little nephew... and...And... if a friend can't help you do something stupid, who can?What's wrong with the truth?Maybe we could rephrase it... Suddenly the door bursts open. Fred and Barney run in with candy and flowers.Rock candy? That's nice, but... why?Not anymore you don't...Have you been drinking? In reply, Fred whips a bottle of champagne into view.Fred, there's no easy way to say this so --The non-refundable dollar signs?Betty... these... these look... real --Fred! Wait a minute! There's something wrong with your lunch --Fit for a king... my king.Good luck. Watch out for those... you know... hostile takeovers.You don't have to win... honorable mention or most Kongenial Kids is perfectly acceptable.Young lady, this is not about beating pants, this is about becoming a well rounded child. Now, what kind of act will you do?I think they're ready for Rock Vegas. As they laugh and hug the kids and Dino, we -- CUT TO: EXT. LODGE HALL - THAT NIGHTFred, is there something you want to tell me about the lodge meeting?Fred, this was supposed to be a 'typical evening' at the Flintstones, and you invited fifty people I don't even know. Now what's going on? Where are they taking my ficus-sauruses?Thank heaven. There isn't one person I know here.I mean including Fred. They look over at --Fred, can I talk to you -- ? Fred? Fred? We have a serious problem with Betty and Barney.I mean you're treating them horribly! What's come over you, Fred? Does a little money mean so much to you that you just turn your back on the things that really count?Arrrgh -- !Fred... I... I'm sorry it's not working out... Fred turns, puts on a big smile.Fred...Fred, I want to be here with you --Come on, Pebbles. We're going to another party.We'll find out together. She takes the girl's hand and goes to the door, where the last of Leach's crew is just going out. Suddenly Betty catches up to her, Bam-Bam in tow.Why?Uh... thank you... I think.Oh? Is Fred getting promoted? Lava laughs, sure she's kidding... then not so sure. The ventriloquist finishes to scattered applause. The kid bows, gets up... splashes across puddles of water on the stage area. The Headmistress of L'ecole Superior et al steps up. Behind her, the picture window displays the expanse of Slate City: The twin Slatescrapers framing endless rows of little tract houses stretching to the distant volcanic ridge.Yeah -- a zoo where the animals are dead -- because if they aren't, they will be!Fred!

Time for nursery school.... Oh, it's not that I'm complaining, Wilma. I mean, Barney's sweet, but... well, he's just not cut out to punch a clock. And he's such a dreamer, you think he ever once picked up a hammer and chisel and tried to balance a checkbook? They pull up in front of a pleasant-looking simple little nursery school. MRS. GRANITE, a pleasant-looking 65, sees them from the schoolyard, waves while Wilma and Betty un- load the kids.No, Barney just keeps looking for that coo-coo berry pie in the sky, and I don't want to pop his balloon by talking about the price of mastodon ribs.You're welcome, Mrs. Granite. But we wipe their mouths every day.We're still shopping around.Morris, what on earth is going on? You giving away Bronto filets?Oh, I'd like some ground mammoth patties and uh... some dodo drumsticks.Here we are, Mrs. Slate. Sorry you had to ride in the back.Likewise.That's right, you don't understand. My husband's business manager usually handles this sort of thing, but I don't mind. And to Wilma's astonishment, Betty takes one of the parchments.I know Bam-Bam -- -- pardonez-moi, 'Bem-Bem' will love attending your school and performing in the talent show. Thank you oh so much.Unless they were forced to go bowling again. Remember that time a burglar pointed a gun at them and said, 'go bowling right now'?Don't tell me. I still can't believe what I did today...I know, I know! I just couldn't stand that woman's attitude! But we had to find a new school anyway, and there we were... the next thing I knew, I was in over my head... but why did you jump in, too?And?What do we tell the boys?We put ourselves in debt so the kids can attend school with a family we can't stand?Flowers?Aw, Barney... I... I don't deserve these. I did something really stupid today.Boys... did you see... the dollar signs there at the bottom?Barney, wait a minute...There. That looks more like a captain of industry.Hmm. Probably run off to the tropics with one of those executive secretaries.Well, you're both going to change your plans. Your new school is going to have a talent show... and you're going to have some talent.We're waiting. Pebbles and Bam-Bam sigh, huddle. We hear snatches of discussion...Well?

That Arnold's got a real arm on him, don't he?Ah, well, that appliance store and me, we kinda had a little adjustment --Fred, don't start on me again. I donno, I'm just not a nine to five guy. I got dreams, Fred. Ideas --I invented fire.I told you that, Fred. But the coal conglomerate ripped me off. The case is still in court, but meanwhile I got lotsa other ideas --Maybe, Fred. But first...Let me try some of that smoke on your car.-- See, the first step, we make a mold of the old car hood, smooth out the dent in the clay -- He tosses the original car hood aside with a crash. Then, moving rapidly, he starts heaving a variety of ingredients into the reverse imprint of the car hood.-- Add some lava granules... some woca leaves... juice from two coo-coo berries...Anything for a pal, Fred -- a lump of coal... bamboo sawdust... eucalyptus sap... a touch of the La Brea tarbrush -- and -- voila. Barney dips a finger in this mess, \"tastes\" it; satisfied, he yanks on a hanging rope and a giant rock weight slams down on the whole mess, making Fred jump out of his skin.Not bad, eh? After it cures for an hour or so, it's solid as a rock.Did I ever?You're a big man anywhere, Fred --Hey. Lava Lane.Yeah, those were the days... we usta dream about coming back here some day with a real car and goin' for the goldrock...!Fred... I thought you said it was time to retire those old dreams.Gee, Fred. I knew you were a big shot. I just didn't know how big. Fred beams at that, and then follows Barney's gaze to the read-out on the truck scale. Fred is standing on it and it's pushing 250. With a scowl, Fred grabs Barney's sleeve and they go into the quarry. As they move, the CAMERA PANS and CRANES UP TOWARDS the window of the Slate Construction Office.Social Security number... dependents... 'how learned of job' ... newspaper ad, carrier pigeon... ... Personal reference... Hearing a loud SMASH, Fred looks up and sees --It looks dangerous. Besides, you can kick Fred's fat butt anytime.Hey, nice going, Fred. You even got the spare --That's a lie, Mr. Slate!B. Rubble. White male personal reference --Well, actually, Fred, it was the other way ar-- Fred hisses between his teeth, repeats the \"Slate and me are just like this\" gesture he made earlier, points at Slate.Sure, Fred, right, right. Slate nods, distracted, his eyes and hands running over the smooth lines of the car hood.Fibrerock, Fred...Gee, thanks, Mr. Slate. Lava glowers. Slate pulls Fred and Barney close with genuine excitement.Gee, Fred, I don't believe it. Eight hours ago I didn't have a job and now look -- I got 1/2 of one percent of the after-taxes after-expenses net breakage profits on Fibrerock!No, Fred, you weren't. I didn't nose any grindstones and you didn't shoulder a wheel. We just hung out together and everything that happened was a total accident.Betty, these are for you. For sticking beside me during the tough times, and well... for making a little guy feel like he was ten feet tall.Hey. Fred does something stupid every day and I still love him.Plenty more where that came from.Yeah. And nothing's ever gonna change that... right, Fred?Indeed we do, Brother Herdmaster. Tonight we are to hear speeches from prospective candidates for Lodge offices, such as good old Fred and some other guys.My apologies, Brother Piltdown. Allow me to rephrase. Tonight we will hear speeches from a whole bunch of good old guys... ... plus the one and only Fred Flintstone! Cheers go up, which drown out Piltdown's renewed cry of the poisoned water hole. Fred moves towards the podium as the noise dies down. NEW ANGLE-- crucible --Thanks, Fred, but here at the lodge drinks are free.'Here's to the Water Buffalo and their next Herdmaster... Fred'!tugs Fred's sleeve, pulls him close.Gee, Fred, how come I didn't get any business cards?Fred, we gotta talk turkey --Fred -- !Fred... what's this single-handed stuff? I distinctly remember at least four hands and two of them were mine.The truth?Okay.I never knew that.I get it. I got the brains, but you just pretend to have them.Thanks, Betty. What would I do without you?Come on, Betty, it's only my first day. You have to have seniority to run off... She giggles, kisses him.Yes, yes. Looking good, Mister Flintstone. I see you've recovered from that polo accident.Gee, Fred, driving with you is better than an 'E' ticket at Magerock Mountain.Oh, hi, Mister Lava.But, Fred, it's right where the employee basketball court used ta be --I guess so. You already did. Lava leads them to a wood-sided trailer.All-right!Ready... aim... fibre! Barney pulls a rope which opens the trough. \"Fibrefoam\" pours into the mold.Fred. You gotta do something about this!That's my Fred... INT. SLATE'S OFFICE - DAYFred? Fred staggers over to his locker, opens it... gets in, and closes the door. We hear a MUFFLED SOB. A NEW ANGLEThey're mad at you, Fred... it's understandable, I mean, they all got laid off today -- Fred crosses to the other guys, puts on a big smile.Is that a riddle? Give me a second --Well, there's not much to tell. True, I got a cut... but Fred's got a gut.Oh, yeah, I remember! I got the mind, but Fred's got the behind. Right, Fred?I voted for you, Fred.Fred! Fred! The Buffalo are heading for big trouble -- !No, no, not that! Piltdown's got the guys all worked up and they're heading down to the quarry! They're gonna wreck the assembly line!No, Fred, if they do that they'll be breakin' the law! Our brother Buffalo could go to jail!I know. Makes you wish things were back the way they were... before we was big executives.Come on Fred. Time to earn those big bucks.Stee-rike one! Heh-hey. Ready for a curve ball?Give me your best shot. Pyrite swings. Barney ducks and Pyrite SMASHES a WINDOW pane. Barney dodges again and the same thing happens. Getting cocky, Barney does it one more time...Chuckles to himself... and then looks down, reacts. CAMERA ADJUSTS and we see that Piltdown has smashed yet another of the duplicate Freds. Worried, Barney looks around, sees that he's just above the Fibrefoam chute. Without another thought, he jumps into it -- slides downward like a passenger on the Magerock Mountain Log Flume ride --Whattya know. Even got the spare again...Excuse me, Mister Lava -- ? I think you oughta know... something could be wrong with the Fibrerock mix.It tastes different.Yup. See, ever since I started with Fibrerock -- I mean, since me and Fred started with it, I always take a little taste of the Fibre foam. And tonight's batch, well... I didn't get much of it, but it seems a little off. Can't fool the old taste buds, heh-heh. I think there might be an ingredient missing. So tomorrow, I'll run a couple of tests and stuff --Nine days, Mister Lava.But --Ah, yup, yup, young feller... jest show me the way to the personnel office... I'm lookin' fer a job as a custodian...Fred's in a high-powered executive job, Betty. There's a lot of pressure on him.Trust me, Betty. After the Fibrerock debut, he'll be the same old Fred. Both react to the sound of HAMMERING and SAWING. Curious, they go out the sliding bedroom door into the yard and see -- THEIR POV - THE FENCE The television crew has just finished nailing boards up over the top of the fence. Now the big potted plants are dropped into place. With each hammer stroke or thud a little more of the late afternoon sun is shut off until Barney and Betty are in shadow. Finally a canvas tarp is tossed as gracefully as pizza dough, sails into the Rubble yard and covers their bird bath. One last stray end lands on Barney's head.You mean beside Fred?See? What'd I tell ya?Hiya, Fred. Boy, the rental place is gonna be mad... ... You feeling better, pal?Creep?Fool?Slimeball? Louse? Jackass? Stuck-up blimpasaurus?Sure, Fred. I've had lots of practice.Yeah. Too bad we never made the team.You know Betty. She never throws anything away. He hauls out an old footlocker, opens it. There they are.Speaking of problems and worries, shouldn't we get on over to Slate's party? Fred has finally \"clinked\" the monster head down into place. Now, when he talks, the monster's mouth moves in sync.Yeah? When did you notice that?Boy, there's no fooling you, Fred. Suddenly, with a GROWING CREAKING, CRACKING and TINKLING, a scale model of Slate City in the corner begins to fall apart.I... I don't know... the Fibrerock it's... it's decomposing... but this shouldn't happen...It should be. There's enough coo-coo berry resin in there to petrify a brontosaurus -- Suddenly Barney gets it. He looks from the older models to the now decomposing little Fibresphere with growing awareness.-- The coo-coo berries! Fred, that's it!Remember I said the Fibrefoam tasted funny? It was the coo-coo sap that was missing!Why? Because coo-coo berries are as valuable as goldrock! And we've had tons of 'em delivered to the plant since we started... somebody musta got greedy --Fred, that sap acts as a fixative -- it's the glue that holds the whole formula together -- !... Is gonna happen for real in the real Slate City!Coo-coo berry sap, Fred! It's our only chance -- their only chance! Barney gives it a quick test squirt. Fred nods, and they rush out of the room. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON the ruins of the model \"Slate City\"... CUT TO:We just tell Mister Slate that all 500 acres of his development are going to crumble into dust any minute. Then we zap the stairs and corridors with some of this coo-coo sap. I just hope we have enough to get everybody out -- whoops!Hang on, hang on --What, and explain what you're doing in that costume? Start talking about coo-coo berries and Fibrerock? By then it'll be too late!We'd better split up; that way at least one of us can make it to the Slate Needle -- !Fred, stop it! It might know the way inside! Fred \"gets up to speed\" and chases the xeno. Barney follows.Sure, pal. We just gotta wait for the fire department. Right, Fred?It must be the suit, Fred -- old Bedrock High built them things to last -- Fred looks over at the wall of flame separating the guests from the fire hose. As everyone gets the same idea, Dino rushes up, the costume head in his mouth. All brighten.-- Okay?Come on, everybody -- we'll go out the way we came! Barney squirts a pathway with his flit gun, solidifying a route in the crumbling Fibrerock. Then Barney and Fred stand back nobly, wave everyone on into the adjacent Fibresphere.Go on, honey... I got Bam-Bam!You think there's gonna be some? Slate looks around at -- HIS POV - THE RUINS AND DESTRUCTION Smoking desolation as far as the eye and CAMERA can see. As we watch the last remaining fragment of Slate City collapse, crushing a police car. BACK TO SCENELava Lava leaves... Woca sap... all still there, but now the nutrients are all released... ...

months. Slate does a Danny Thomas spit take all over the model. EXT. QUARRY - MOVING SHOT Fred and Barney cross the busy lot, sidestepping workers and animals. Fred does a lot of backslapping, waving. Barney's filling out the forms on the move. Behind them, we see the wide access ramp which spirals around the quarry's sides.It's all here in hack and slice. When you committed to this housing development the price of dino kibble was a few clams per ton. Since then, it's gone up a hundredfold. You can't build a project like this without the heavy equipment dinos, and we can't afford to feed those dinos.Sounds like a worker's comp claim if I ever heard one...Uncle, Uncle, speak to me -- But it's only a statue of a golfer from one of Slate's trophies.Eighths --Ivan, look, okay, so I bought too much on margin... everyone said glaciers were here to stay, I mean, who knew? Just leverage my shares in Atlantis dry goods and -- what? When did that happen? Piltdown enters, knocks on the open door.Armored car...?I... I'll get back to you.Piltdown, this Fibrerock program is going to create a lot of changes around the plant. I want to make one more. You've been a wonderful thug and goon for me. Now, I'd like to expand your duties. I want you to become a provocateur.What I mean, is, I'm going to use you to double-cross your Lodge and Union brothers, and make their lives a living hell.Good. You and your little pal will report directly to me and take orders only from me. Now get out of here and start screwing your former friends and associates.Coo-coo berries... CUT TO:Flintstone! Rubble!Please, call me Jerry. Uncle -- I mean, Mister Slate told me to take you to your offices. If you'll follow me...?The Fibrerock assembly line. Unc -- Mister Slate's had a crew working on it all weekend. We're going to roll out the first sheets of Fibrerock by mid-week.Well, gentlemen, here you are. As soon as you're settled, come over to the assembly line. We'll go over the Fibrerock formula before the first run. He goes off. Fred and Barney go --Of course he can, Flintstone. It's his quarry.A simple little heist -- I gave you everything but the keys and you blew it --The day after Slate City opens there's going to be an audit. If the stuff isn't gone by then we'll all be doing time until the Bronze Age.How do you know that? I mean... ah, why do you say that?Tastes... different?Rubble, Rubble! We're fighting a deadline to finish Slate City... and we're not pulling the plug on production to satisfy your tastebuds! If you ask me, you and your tastebuds are overworked ... overwrought... how long have you been with us, anyway?Jumping Jurrasic, no wonder you're so run down.I'm authorizing a nice vacation for you, Rubble. Starting tomorrow. You can catch some rays, maybe invent something... hey, how about Fibrerock, the sequel, part II -- ?No, don't try and thank me.... As you can see, the Fibrerock is so light we're using it for construction, for furnishings... for everything. You can't stack a two-bedroom cave this high... but the sky's the limit with Fibrerock!That's brilliant, Unc... Mister Slate. In fact, maybe you can help me with the centerpiece of the complex... ... I wanna call 'em the FibreSphere and the '____' something Needle... but I just can't...'Slate Need...' ... How do you keep coming up with these? It's uncanny.Oh, that reminds me, sign these, will you... just a few overruns ... minor cost problems... that's it... thank you...... Oh, Mister Slate, we're going to hold the Bedrock Junior Talent Show in the uh, 'Slate Needle.' Good for public relations -- Lava breaks off. He's just looked out the window and seen --That takes care of the half-pint. Now to deal with the half-wit. CUT TO: INT. LAVA'S OFFICE - DAY Lava walks Fred from the door into the color-coordinated high-style room.-- Oh? Or check up on us? Emotionally, Lava turns, indicates a picture of Slate on the wall.Flintstone, that... that's a slap in the face of our founder... our employer... our uncle. Unless, of course, you agree with Rubble... that Mister Slate isn't capable of running this operation ... that I'm not capable of running it?Call me Jerry. Sit down, please... Fred complies. Lava winces as his designer FURNITURE CREAKS under Fred's weight, but he only says --... Cigar?Fred, let me get to the bottom slime. Some men -- you and me, for instance -- we're cut out for the big time, the big bucks... ... the big everything. Lava smiles, prepares the tips on two cigars. He puts each one in turn in a gizmo on his desk.... Now, I know your pal Barney had a small part in the preliminary research and development of Fibrerock...Yes?You're too kind, Flintstone, that's what I like about you. But you're a big guy with a big decision to make. Are you gonna keep covering for Barney, keep pulling his acornsauruses out of the fire... or are you going to concentrate on your own important duties?Publicity, Flintstone, publicity!And that's why I've got a little surprise for you... for the man who made Fibrerock a household word, I want you to meet the man who's going to make you a household word...Right, Fred. As long as you forget all this nonsense about Barney.Of course, Poindexter, of course. They head for the mastodon and pully-powered elevator. Standing there are Piltdown and Pyrite, both in security guard uniforms. . Lava gives them a big look. They nod. As the elevator rises, his two cronies duck into a stairwell marked \"NO ADMITTANCE.\"You're certainly looking lovely this evening, Mrs. Flintstone. Life with a junior executive must agree with you.Yes. I think so, too. Imagine how good you'd look with a senior executive.That's ridiculous, Flintstone! Nobody could get that many coo-coo berries off our premises!They're convincing fakes, Mrs. Rubble -- part of our exciting display --Uncle! Are you going to stand there while aspersions are being cast at the Slate family? This is absurd --All right, all right, I admit it! I got in over my head in the stock market... took some big losses... I had these guys pull jobs for me all over town disguised as a monster... but it still wasn't enough... and when I saw all those coo-coo berries being delivered every day, I guess I just lost my head...

A cacophony of voices starts to answer.Shut up! I want one person to answer me: Who's responsible for this? PILTDOWNWho are you?Flintstone, I have just one thing to say to you -- Fred cringes. Piltdown and Pyrite smirk.Congratulations!This stuff you had on your car is the most incredible building material I've seen in thirty years in the construction business! It's strong -- -- Light -- -- Resilient -- It rebounds, \"SPROINGING\" him on the chin. He recovers, shakes it off.Where on earth did you get it?The rest of you men go back to work.

Two simple-minded run-of-the-mill nobodies.Boys, this is a small step for Slate Construction... a giant step for all mankind. He points to the translucent material. CAMERA TIGHTENS ON it. We see Fred, Barney and Slate's reflections in it.The Stone Age is over! Let the Fibre Age begin! As HEROIC MUSIC STINGS IN, we...Men, this is a proud day for Slate Construction.

Why -- I could lock the front door and go fishing if I wanted!Why, I could even fire Lava here if I wanted. Lava quivers with mock surprise. Everyone really laughs, now.Or... I could fire you, Fred.Flintstone, Lava, here, recommended that you be in charge of public relations to get Fibrerock off to a good start. I'm a member of that public, Flintstone, and I have to say... this isn't a good start. I'm getting a bad feeling about Fibrerock. A bad feeling about... you. You want that feeling to go away, don't you?Good. Then turn around and walk out of here and we'll forget all about this.'Sky's the limit'... 'sky's the limit'... why, these two buildings, they... they practically scrape the sky! We should call them... Slate scrapers!How about, 'Slate Needle'?It's a gift...Loses his balance, grabs onto Lava for support, ends up pulling him down, too.

I'm gonna kick your fat butt --Why should we?It was Flintstone, Mr. Slate!Seated across the room with Pyrite and other cronies, he immediately leaps to his feet, paws the ground, and gives an eerie moan even stranger than the Herdmaster's earlier call to order.You bet I do. How come Flintstone is 'good old Fred' and me and the other candidates are just 'some other guys'?You and Slate? Who are you kidding, Flintstone? The only partner you got is hanging over your belt. Pyrite laughs, a bit too much.-- If I don't, you will --Mister Lava, the armored car is here.Yeah. Must be a fortune in coo-coo berries on that baby.

It's no secret that most of our lodge members are also members of Amalgamated Neolithic 101... which means that most of us aren't gonna be able to make our cave payments next month. So my agenda for tonight... ends right now. There's a time to be a Buffalo... there's a time ta be a brown nosin' double-crossin' creep... All heads turn and swivel to look at Fred... swivel back.... and there's a time to stand up and be a man! So let's go down there and make the Slate shop into slate scrap... then we'll see how he gets along without the heavy equipment operators of Neolithic 101! Meeting adjourned!Okay! Let's start with Slate's golf trophies and work our way up to the assembly line!

Now, he sees Fred coming toward him...
