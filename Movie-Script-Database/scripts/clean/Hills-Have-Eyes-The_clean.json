Thank God!He's right, Bob.I think we're somewhere on this blue road...Don't drive so fast Bob, you might lose the camper...Hey... Watch your mouth, young lady. Will you please back me up here?Oh, so now it's my fault? Doug joins them.Can we use the C/B?I bet this desert is full of rattlesnakes...Some things never change...It's almost 3, you'll never be back before sunset.We should pray before you go-Is it really too much to ask? Bob? Bob finally agrees, and like a good family man, he gathers them around. Brenda slips on her shirt and joins them.You shouldn't go from the bottle to the breast. At her age she should get used to one or the other.This place isn't so bad. At least the air is fresh.Maybe it was my fault we had this accident...This family has certainly seen its share of adventures.Probably some rattlesnakes not far away.Brenda's going off to college. And then, next year, it's Bobby's turn... The house is going to feel so empty... Lynn grabs her mother's hand-I'm really happy that we're all together on this trip. Brenda moves to the trailer. Beauty is still barking inside.You think he can hear me?She couldn't have gone that far. Brenda notices the revolver on the table. Bobby is unarmed.Hello...Hello... Can somebody hear me? Please answer if you hear me. Hello? No answer. The radio goes silent. Lynn joins her, holding the baby.I heard something. She fiddles with the radio.I'm not even sure I know how to use this thing. Lynn hands her Catherine, and sits in front of the C/B.It sounded like an animal... Lynn stands up worried.Watch your language!Lynn, wait. Ethel stays alone with the baby.You're lucky Brenda found you. Imagine if you had to spend the whole night out there in the cold. Bobby winces from the pain.It doesn't work...I'm sure it was just static.Looks like we're camping out tonight. How's your head? Bobby doesn't answer.Bobby? What's going on? A beat.Are you sure?Me too, honey. Come inside. You've already spent enough time in the cold for one day, don't you think?No..No.. It's not possible. That's not Bob. That's not my Bob. She grabs Doug by his shirt trying to convince him.Doug.. It's not him. Tell me it's not him. It's not my Bob! The poor woman has lost her mind. Ethel erupts in laughter pointing to her dead husband.This camper's so small. No matter how much you clean, it's always a mess.Is Big Bob home?Did everyone go to bed?Is Lynn sleeping? Doug holds back the tears.Look in the closet Doug, I'm sure I have another blanket. I'm so cold. Doug tucks one of the blankets around her.You've always been so sweet.

A beat.Everybody's gotta have a cell phone...No kidding... As the old man closes the hood, a familiar sound returns-Let me pay, Bob.That's not what I meant...Honey!? We're leaving... Lynn grabs the dog by the collar.Honey? What are you doing?!I tried for an hour but I couldn't get it cold in here. CLICK- the light turns on and the A/C starts.How do you know all this stuff?Well, at least we can breathe now.(lighting it with aYeah right, if you start smoking your sister would cut my nuts off.Hey, I like seeing your parents...

Not only are the tires flattened, but the front axel has buckled from hitting the rocks.So what's the damage, General?Can we fix it?I already tried. I'm not getting a signal.What are we going to do? Without answering, Big Bob gets back on his feet, wipes his hands and grabs a bottle of water from the car. After a longWalk?! But we're miles fromLynn, can you bring me my jacket honey? Lynn gets up and returns to the trailer.I'll keep walking north. This road's gotta lead somewhere. Lynn comes around with the jacket and sees Big Bob and Bobby both holding guns.\"...All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray. I've been for a walk on a winter's day. I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A... California dreamin...\" After hours of walking down this road, his face shows signs of fatigue.I was in LA._ California Dreamin...\" The lyrics resonate throughout the desert. Suddenly, he stops singing.What the fuck are you doing? Don't point that thing at me. Bobby lowers the weapon.Who else would it be?! Bobby is interrupted by Brenda who sees Doug from the window.Hey girls! Quickly, Lynn exits the trailer and jumps into her husband's arms. They kiss. Doug sets down all of his findings.Look what I found. Various tools, a fishing pole...With all of this, we can find a way to fix the car, right Bobby? Bobby doesn't answer.I found this really huge crater at the end of the road! I've never seen anything like it! People must use it as a dump site. It was full of all this garbage... (pointing to the fishingNo. The road just stops there. I hope your dad has better luck. Is there anything to eat? I'm starving.I'm tired, I really need to rest for an hour or so...You want us to sleep on the floor?! Doug kisses Catherine and hands her to Brenda so she can put her to bed. Bobby takes him aside.What? Bobby hesitates to talk.So, what Bobby? Lynn walks by-Listen... I'm sure your dad will be back soon. He's \"Big Bob\". It's gonna take more than a few snakes in the dark to stop him, right?Ow, Ow... Yeah right there. Perfect. God, I feel like I crossed New Mexico on foot. Amused, Lynn squeezes his legs a bit harder. She moves up to his love handles.Stop! Stop, you're tickling me! Lynn continues with more fervor.Oh, so you want to play? He turns around and starts tickling her as well. They laugh together before kissing passionately.I love you too... They start making out.Damanit! What is it now?Beauty what?Calm down Bobby, OK? Let's go check it out together. Lynn, stay right here.Take your mother away from here! With her eyes fixed on her father, Lynn walks her mother away. In Bobby's eyes, sadness has been replaced by hatred. Full of rage, the youngster grabs the gun and walks away.Where are you going? Bobby?Come back here, Bobby! Bobby disappears into the night. Doug covers Big Bob's face with a blanket.Not yet.Yes, Brenda is here and Bobby is in the kitchen. At the other end, Bobby turns away, crying. Brenda looks away as well.Yes.. Do you need anything? Ethel finds it more and more difficult to talk.You want to die, too?Look! Look at what they did to your mother. Look at what they did to your sister. He slams Bobby against the door.You're not a fucking child, alright? Think before you do something stupid. You won't make it three feet! We need a plan, OK? We need to think...Get ready Bobby.. Doug opens the door and jumps out ready to fight. From beneath the trailer, someone observes him... Doug bends down and discovers- GOGGLE'S SEVERED ARM. In its hand, the walkie-talkie still works.Beast! The dog jumps into Doug's arms and begins licking his face. Bobby can't believe it, his dog has returned. Radio static comes back on the walkie. Bobby picks it up-How much ammo do you have left?No, you stay here with your sister and stay by the radio. Somebody's bound to hear us. Brenda continues her distress call.No. You keep it in case they come back.Don't worry about me, I'll take Beast. Beast sits at his feet ready to go. Doug straps the walkie- talkie over his shoulder.Yes?I'm going to find.our baby my love...I promise.I told you to stop smoking. Doug sets a different frequency on his radio-Bobby? Bobby? You read me?I followed the blood, I'm in front of a mine!I'm not sure if I'll get a signal from inside. If you don't hear from me in a half an hour, you're on your own.Come on. You can't be serious. Then light goes. completely off, leaving Doug in darkness. Scratch! - He lights a match. Holding the tiny flame, Doug continues down the tunnel until he arrives at another fork. He can no longer see the blood trail.(to Beast, meaningBobby, do you hear me? Bobby? Still nothing. Doug turns around and looks up- A wall of rock towers behind him. He tries one last time, but the signal won't go through.Find her, Beast, find Catherine... With his nose to the ground, the dog pulls Doug straight ahead. Doug walks away through the streets, pulled by the dog. On the outskirts of town, we discover a fence buried in the sand. On it, an old metallic sign reads-Shhhh... Quiet Beast... Don't move! I'll be back... He closes the car door and starts down the alley, lowering his head.Where's my baby! Where's Catherine?! Big Brain does not answer.What did you do with her?Where is she then? ANSWER ME! He raises the bat.What signs?!What the hell are you saying?!I don't know what you're talking about. All I want is my daughter. Please... Big Brain remains silent.What do you want? Money? I can give you money... WHAT DO YOU WANT?Where are the others? Where is my baby? Big brain starts laughing a high pitched sound.What? What's so funny?Please, I'm begging you... Don't kill me...Catherine?! He goes to the crib and discovers a plastic doll...Catherine!My baby ...My little princess... It's me, it's daddy... He kisses the baby and hugs her tightly, elated.

It's their silver anniversary and they're so happy you're here.You're wrong. They love you.Yeah, that's a great idea. Why didn't you plan it?Never mind. Lynn grabs the milk bottle from its heater.Doug, please stop. I never ask you for anything, OK? Well see how happy you are when Catherine comes along on our 25th anniversary. She walks out.I heard that...If you want to use the restroom, it's now or never. Bobby removes his headphones and pushes Brenda.Honey, you haven't put that phone down since we left.Beauty? Come on, sweetie... No answer. Cautiously, Lynn moves through the store to the beaded curtains. Above the cash register, an old sepia photograph of a miner stares at her.Beauty? Lynn goes into the other room. In the darkness, among the old empty bottles, she finds Beauty standing with her front legs on a window sill and barking to the backyard. Lynn looks outside- Nobody. Only the desert and hills. Inside the room, THE HALF OPEN EXPENSIVE LEATHER BAG laying alone on the table awakens her curiosity. As she goes to inspect it, she hears the SUV starting and Doug calling out-Sorry, our dog got out...She won't stay put... A car horn breaks the silence.Mom, we're not on the blue road or any other road. He said it wasn't on the map, remember? In the distance, A LIZARD moves through some rocks before heading across the road unconcerned by the approaching car.Relax, Mom. We're all just tired.Doug? Bobby? Are you alright? Bobby opens the door releasing the barking dogs.She's fine. Mom has her.The heat must have caused a blow out.I think so... Just a little shaken up. Bobby walks around the car evaluating the damage- The SUV tires are shredded - the rims buried into the ground.Doug...Catherine just fell asleep. How are you holding up?Yeah, this is a total drag, especially with a baby.We're not going to have many more trips like this together... As for Cancun, you're gonna have to find a job.What are you going to do with those?Are you sure you're going to be alright? Lynn puts a fisherman's hat on Doug to protect him from the sun and kisses him tenderly.Hey, little princess. Who doesn't want to sleep anymore? The baby looks at her mother, appeased.Are you hungry, my angel? Lynn picks her up and exits the trailer.Mom, thanks for the advice, but she's my baby. Vexed, Ethel remains quiet.It's starting to get cold out here, isn't it? I can't believe you're spending your anniversary stranded in the middle of nowhere.Better than Cleveland...Please, Mom. Nothing can stop Dad when he thinks he's found a shortcut. Remember when we ran out of gas on the \"shortcut\" to the Great Lakes? How old was I? 12, 13?Yeah-what I'd do for a shower and a margarita...A real bed... Bobby sits down at the table.Why are the dogs so excited?I don't know, Mom.Keep it together Brenda, Mom is already worried enough... The fire will help Bobby find his way back.He and Beauty will find their way back together. Lynn hugs her sister.I never thought it could be so cold in the desert...I know...How's it going?Mayday ...mayday... This is a distress call... Do you copy? Still nothing.Mayday. . .We're stranded in the desert, we need help...mayday... Suddenly, the light on the C/B turns green and static can be heard. Ethel grabs her daughter's hand, hopeful that someone may have heard them. A second later, HEAVY BREATHING is heard over the radio. The light turns off. The two women look at each other in confusion.What was that?If animals start answering our radio calls, we're really fucked!Give it a rest, Mom. We have more important things to worry about. She walks out.Brenda? No answer.Brenda? Brenda?We heard something. Some sort of breathing... Bobby lifts his head.It was really weird, right mom?Mom, it sounded like a perverted crank call.What are you going to do with a fishing pole in the desert? You didn't you find anybody?Let's go, it's freezing out here. Doug follows Lynn inside the trailer.Don't close the door, we're leaving in a second!I'm almost ready...A little work out can't be all that bad for these guys, right? Doug laughs and giggles.I love you...What do you want, Bobby?This had better be important. Bobby is too scared to keep the truth hidden. He regains his calm before talking.Bobby...

The eye goes away... He re-zips looking outside. Nobody. When he exits, Brenda appears on the other side.Freak. She looks at him slightly confused...It was nothing... The thermostat was disconnected. He turns to Doug.I don't know.I thought you stopped smoking?It's cool that you came with us. It's a drag when it's just us and our parents...Don't worry, we're fine.Holy shit!I saw a documentary on The Discovery channel about desert snakes. If you get bit, you'll die in twenty minutes. Big Bob reaches into the glove compartment pulling out a 9mm and an extra clip. He hands it to his son..or was it five? Bobby grabs the firearm pointing it to the desert. Big Bob grabs another gun from the car, A 44 CHROME PLATEDYou think we'll see scorpions and coyotes? Big.Bob grabs his son by the shoulders, proud. They look like two kids getting ready to play Cowboys and Indians. Bobby calls out to Doug, offering the gun-Hey Doug, wanna try?Come on, just one shot, it makes you feel kinda powerful. Big Bob answers for Doug-Can I go with Doug?Has anybody seen my grey sweatshirt? It was in the car. I've looked everywhere.Brenda, the dogs! Too late. Beauty runs out in the direction of the hills Bobby drops his plate and gives chase.Dam\u00c2\u00a2nit, Brenda! Beauty! Worried, Ethel watches her son distance himself from the camper.Beauty? Beauty? Bobby moves cautiously. He picks up a big stone for protection- A dangerous animal could be hiding behind any corner. A SHADOW PASSES BEHIND HIM.. Bobby doesn't notice. Anaaaaaau - A swift sound of breathing breaks the silence. Bobby spins around, ready to strike.Beauty? Bobby is ready to give up when something attracts hisDon't... Don't be scared. I won't hurt you... What are you doing here? The girl keeps silent. Bobby drops the stone to the ground but the young girl remains suspicious.So you're the one who took my sweatshirt? Where did you find it? The young girl smiles shyly. The ice is broken.What's your name? The young girl hesitates and murmurs in a frail voice.What are you doing here Ruby? Where are your parents? My family needs help. We had an accident. Ruby repeats her name mechanically as if she doesn't understand the questions.I heard you, Ruby... Are you here alone? Ruby won't answer.Ruby... I'm looking for my dog... Do you understand? My dog... her name is Beauty... She's a German Shepherd, about this high...That's right, have you seen her?Have you seen her? Ruby looks down. She knows something.Look at me, Ruby... Look at me... Where did you see my dog? Ruby keeps looking to the ground. Bobby reaches under her chin to raise her head. Instinctively, Ruby SCREAMS as she backs off, lifting her hands to protect herself.What? I can't understand. What are you saying? He comes closer trying to make eye contact as she continues to murmur the same thing. She too is terrified-Ruby, come back! Once more, Bobby is alone in the labyrinth. On the other side, he finds a trail of blood as if a body had been dragged on the rocks. The bloody trail is still fresh and disappears behind another set of rocks a few feet away. Bobby hesitates, unsure of what he might find... As soon as he's around the outcropping to the other side Bobby sees something that stops him dead in his tracks. Before him, on the ground, is Beauty. Dead. Disemboweled. Bobby drops to his knees, disbelieving, his face turning white. He touches the animal's head as if to convince himself that this nightmare can't be possible at all. Beauty's face is locked in a grimace of horrible pain and shock. And... the animal is missing its front right leg. DRIP... DRIP... DRIP... DROPS OF BLOOD fall on Bobby's hand - ABOVE HIM, PERCHED ON A ROCK, A FIGURE OBSERVES HIM. A man with an impressive build crouches like a monkey. He wears old clothes covered with dust, and a DERBY HAT on his head. Binoculars hang around his neck.Have you tried the radio?What do you mean?Ssshhhh... His mother and two sisters are surprised by his agitated behavior.I want you guys to stay in here. Brenda?! You hear me? Gun in hand, he opens the door- Bobby is about to shoot when a figure emerges from the dark. IT'S DOUG, holding as much as he could carry from the car graveyard.I didn't know it was you.Nothing, Mom.I'll feel a lot better when dad gets back.We can squeeze in here. You'll be more comfortable.What?Beast?! He grabs the gun and exits the trailer, leaving the door open.Beast? Come on, boy. You hear me! Come on now. Bobby moves further from the trailer towards the barking.Beast? Beast? Its me. Come on... All of a sudden the growling becomes a \"mooing\" cow. Then a goat. Then a chicken. Terrified, Bobby turns around and runs back toward the SUV.Doug! Doug! Caught red-handed, Lynn dresses and Doug pulls up his pants.Come on, open up! Lynn opens the back window giving him a dirty look.Something's going on around here. We're not alone. Exasperated, Lynn takes a deep breath, not taking him seriously.I know this sounds weird, but there are people living in those hills.I saw them. And Beauty...They cut out her insides.Her guts were all over the place... He struggles to talk.I...I didn't want to scare you so I didn't say anything, but something's going on... You even said you heard some breathing on the radio didn't you? Lynn nods.We're not alone, I'm telling you... Doug exits the car. Obviously, Bobby is not kidding.I'm gonna take care of the motherfuckers!Come on Doug! They're in the trailer-! They both take off running.Doug! Doug does not answer and takes Ethel's hand. She opens her eyes and looks at him as if nothing happened.Fine. You stay here. I'm going after them. Doug gets between Bobby and the door, preventing the kid from leaving.Let me go!I don't care. Doug drags him in front of his mother's body.Think about what? They have Catherine, Doug... Doug remains silent...THEY HAVE CATHERINE... You know what they could to do to her, and you're not going to stop them?! You're just a coward... Doug jumps back on Bobby grabbing him by the collar.Good boy.. That's a good dog.I don't know, half a clip?Let me go with you.What about you?Doug?I... I didn't mean what I said... Doug hugs him like a brother. Before walking out, he bends down to Lynn's body and kisses her one last time on the mouth.Yeah, Doug...Yeah... Good luck, Doug. He puts the walkie away and takes out the flashlight.Nobody's going to find us Brenda, even with that smoke...Nobody's coming._.. You heard what Doug said-We're alone now, just you and me. Let them come, I'm waiting for them. Now, Bobby stretches the nylon wire from the fishing pole around each stake.
