{"Sex-and-the-City": {"CARRIE": {"raw_line": "Year after year, twenty-something women come to New York City in search of the two \"L's\": labels and love.Twenty years ago... I was one of them.Having gotten the knack for labels early... I concentrated on my search for love.Turns out, a \"knock-off\" is not as easy to spot when comes to love...Until it is.That is why you need help to spot them...... Lots of help.Year after year, my single girlfriends were my salvation. And, as it turns out...... My meal ticket.We still are those four single girls...Even though, technically... we're not.One of us is married...One of us... married, divorced and re-married...One of us... relocated.And... one of us stayed exactly where she was.In love.I've always loved this block.Finding the perfect apartment in New York City is like finding the perfect partner. It can take years.This is thirty-three.Thirty-four. Lucky thirty-four?If anything else opens up let us know. We're very interested in this building.Oh my God. I've died and gone to real estate heaven. Look at this place.Hellooo, I live here.What -- Nirvana?No, he's my boyfriend.Point taken. From now on... you'll be my man friend.Well, if the shoe fits.Hideous. Hate it. Hurts my eyes.How is this place even available?If you live here what is there to fight about?This is the master closet? No.Hmmm. Hmmm. Now, I understand the divorce.Can we afford this?\"I got it.\" Just like that. \"I got it\" -- like he was picking up the check for coffee or something.Except for the closet which Big says he can redo -- also he says the kitchen needs work but I don't know about that `cause I keep sweaters in my stove.Yes, together. That's right.Oh, Miranda, please, I haven't figured out all the details yet, but I'm a smart girl and I'm sure I'll figure out something I'm comfortable with.And I love you for it -- but for now can't you stop worrying for me and just go ahead and feel what I want you to feel. Jealous.Jealous of me living in this gorgeous penthouse in Manhattan.There she is. Hey Hollywood!How was your flight?It was a rare occasion that brought all types of women together. The socialites, the trendies the yuppies, the yentas.Blair Elkenn was a waitress turned model turned actress turned billionaire's girlfriend who came home one night to find herself unceremoniously turned out on the street.And now she was getting the ultimate break-up revenge. An embarrassing and very public auction of all the jewelry he had given her when they were happy.And a little too much.And people say the golden age of television is over.If Schadenfreude is the word for feeling pleasure at someone else misfortune -- This was \"jewelryfreude.\"And the gloves are off.I'm not sitting, I'm thinking.I'm thinking I'm going to sell my apartment and put the money towards heaven on Fifth.I know but --We're together ever night -- so I'm basically paying a mortgage on a glorified closet.There's plenty of room at the new place and -- besides.. I want to make us -- a life there. I want it to be ours.And that's so amazing --but you bought it, so it's really your place. And -- if anything were to happen...I have to be smart here. I mean, we're not married and I'd have no legal rights to... this home that I built... with you.I didn't think it was an option.Well, people are always assuming we are.You and me.Why -- Do you want to get married?No, if that's what you want. Is that what you want?Okay. Really? We're getting married.No, please, don't get me a diamond. Get me a really big closet.So, the other night, Big and I were talking about, you know, moving in together and our future...... And about what makes sense as we move forward. And, well... we decided to get married.Everyone's lookingI am mortified.Well... I made a little decision that I hope you'll be happy about.No. I did not get BotoxI did not call to talk about Botox.So... Last week, after the auction, I started thinking about my options.Right, and... well, Big and I decided to get married.Yes.You sounded more excited about the botox.Hello?I hear ya.I know.Sorry about the extra paper work.Samantha, it feels so different this time. No clich\u00e9 romantic kneeling down on one knee. Just you know, two grown-ups -- making a decision about spending their lives together.And one more thing... I want you to be maid of honor. How do you feel about that?As a wedding gift, Charlotte had given me Anthony Marantino -- friend and wedding planner.What? She was borderline anyway.Oh. I found the dress.The other day. I have it here.Here it is.Well... that was the exact reaction I was aiming for.Simple and classic. When I saw it I just thought: That is what I should marry Big in.No one. I found it in a vintage shop.Don't worry, I'll style it up with shoes.I heard that.And from Anthony Marantino to spaghetti marinara.It's okay, I know all about sex.... \"Color\"?We get it. You love to color. Why are you asking?So... Sleep is the new sex?-- I meant coloring.Oh my.Never. But, I will tell you this. When Big colors -- He rarely stays inside the lines.One glass of Merlot and two orgasms later.And that is how Samantha learned she had a new neighbor.John?Lean?I love the smell.\"The Love Letters of Great Men.\" Volume one.No, but some of your classmates are. Voltaire, Napoleon...No, I don't -- you have them. Here's Napoleon... \"My dearest Josephine, I wake consumed with thoughts of you --\"Research for my new book.Love. I use to write about finding love-- now I want to write about what happens after you've found it.Stay tuned.Listen... Here's Beethoven.\"My thoughts go out to you today my immortal beloved. I can live only wholly with you or not at all.\"\"Be calm my life, my all. Only by calm consideration of our existence can we achieve our purpose to live together. Oh continue to love me, never misjudge the most faithful heart of your beloved. Ever thine -- ever mine -- ever ours.Have you ever written me a love letter?When have I ever gotten a love fax?Yeah, yeah.... Put it in writing.I've been thinking.How about we get married at The New York Public Library? Think how perfect. You and I and our love story surrounded by all the other lesser love stories.It's not that big a deal. It's seventy-five people in a room that's partitioned in half.Well, what did you have in mind?Interesting.Elaine, hi. Do you know John?Elaine writes a single gal column for The New York Post.Well. We're getting married.Our wedding's on Page Six.Oh, I know who.Later that day, I met my friend Stanford for our weekly quick lunch and gossip session... Also known as \"dish then dash.\"Rumor has it.Where are we eating?It seemed everywhere I went... people I knew were excited and available to come to the wedding.The shocking thing was not the plethora of empty autumn social calenders but knowledge that everyone does indeed read Page Six.Even people you didn't expect, like my Vogue editor, Enid.Great. Who am I interviewing?Wait -- I would be in the magazine?Enid -- I'm so very flattered but--Well, I'm hardly the last single girl.I thought the issue was \"great style at every age.\"Enid -- I have no idea -- were you ever married?Why didn't the marriage work out?None at all.Just your typical Wednesday. Breakfast with... Vera Wang.Mid-morning coffee with.... Carolina Herrera.Appetizers with Oscar de la Renta.Lunch with Lanvin...... And Lacroix.... And Dior.And for dessert -- Vivienne Westwood.A confection so special...... It could wring a wedding tear from even the most unbelieving of women.And then the impossible happened.And just like that, Vivienne Westwood kicked my sweet little suit's ass.Double door. So far so good.Well. You did me proud, Mister.Like it? It's love at first sight.Now, I believe this is all really happening.Yeah, a sign I priced it too low.That's the food -- money on the table. I'll get started in the closet... I should be done in seventeen years.You're good friends.What are you doing here?!It took four friends, three days to put twenty years into twenty-eight boxes.Hi.Well, I'm so excited you are here for a sleepover.Brady, do you want to go have some peanut butter?Steve. I can't believe it. Steve.The next night, for the sake of Brady, Miranda went against her instincts and went home.So Miranda left Brooklyn and came home... to Manhattan.I don't know if this question is allowed -- but how is Steve handling this?That's what I said.Charlotte made love to Harry five times that week.Miranda was starting to see the upside of Alzheimer's.Wedding crunch time. We need to really get serious here.Nope. Wedding before contractor. Unless you're planning to invite him -- which would make the guest list two hundred and one.Blame the New York Post and Vogue. Two publications that have never before been uttered in the same sentence.It's the dress. How can I explain this? It's like poker -- The dress upped the ante.No, no, no -- you haven't seen this dress. This dress may be the whole reason to get married. Well, you and the dress.How are you coming with your vows? Just a reminder -- you are going to be saying these in front of a lot of people, so the pressure is on.Hey...This is our wedding and you're not taking it seriously.I didn't know that was even an issue. Why didn't you say anything sooner?But -- don't you want --I think it's too late for city hall now.You're a great man friend.Who is that again?Karl's kind of a jerk.Whooo!Jackass.There you are. I thought you skipped out on me.Well, the all-gal sleepover is about to commence. You gonna miss me?Oh... One night won't kill you. And tomorrow you get to have me for the rest of your life.Is everything okay?Go home and sleep. Now, give me a kiss good night. Make it good -- it's the last single girl kiss.There we sat... like a scene out of Louisa May Alcott's: \"Not-so Little Women.\"Ha ha -- hilarious -- we broke up a lot.You want to answer? Go ahead, sweetie... Open it up...Say something.Sweetie, that was your first bootie call.Hello?Oh my God -- did you just hear Lily?It's Big. I'm gonna take it in the--What's the matter?You won't.Here's the thing. This is me that you're marrying tomorrow. Me. Nobody else.And I'm marrying you. It's me and you. And you want to know the good news there?We've already both done everything we can to screw it up.Is that a smile I'm hearing?Now, it sounds to me like you've got a bit of writer's block on the vow front.And I find - you know - as a professional writer- it's best to just, you know, stop thinking about it so much -- and go to bed. And in the morning...Exactly. And if not -- Just write this: \"I will love you.\" Simple and to-the-point. And I swear I won't even try to take credit for it.You're going to bed now, right?I'll see you tomorrow. Hey. Me and you.There you are! Almost lost you under all that. Got your purse?Whose got a mirror?Stanford, you're on my dress.It's Carrie... leave me a message.This is Carrie, leave a message.What's happening?Did anyone call him? Give me a phone. Someone give me a phone.I don't know how to work this.Are you okay?I don't know where my phone is! What is going on? Where are you?Oh my God --He's not coming. Oh my God.Get me out of here. -- Get me out of here!I knew you would do this -- I knew it!You left! I am humiliated!I thought I would still be in extreme pain but I'm feeling nothing.I'd like a little more nothing.I had gone from Little Women to Little Drunk Women.Yes, I'm still jilted.I knew it when he called last night. I could tell.Didn't want to believe it. Didn't even want to say it out loud. And now I have nowhere to love -- I meant live. I have nowhere to live.Forever.Well, if you change your minds, I know where we can get one hundred beef, seventy-five fish and twenty- five vegetarian meals.And my clothes. All my clothes. I can never go over there again. How am I going to get my clothes?A hit man? I have nothing to wear but a wedding gown.There's the silver lining. A honeymoon to a romantic Mexican resort that's pre-paid on my credit card because I wanted to surprise the man who jilted me.Wasn't there?Close the shutters.All of them.Did I dream it?So?I'm tired.Is there coffee?Let's go down to the hotel for dinner on the beach tonight.Yeah. I've got to do something to pull me out of my Mexicoma.Too late.I'll drink hers.We're staying in one of the private houses. Number three.That was like taking a bullet.Will I ever laugh again? I'm serious.When?Thank god for that Mariachi band or I'd be able to hear my own thoughts.After everything I know... After twenty years of everything we've learned -- I threw it all away for the thrill of putting his name on the honeymoon suite. If I met me now -- I wouldn't know me.So, you're saying marriage is a bad thing? Good to know right about now.Technically -- we're on my honeymoon.He couldn't get out of the car. After everything he'd already put me through -- he couldn't make the effort and get out of the car? I made the effort -- I put a bird on my head.Yes.No. It was a bird.He's a bad guy. Always was. Bad guys do bad things.That's nice. Kinda balances off the one ball.Mrs. Preston will take the check.\"Mail box full.\"Not ready to face it all yet.Well, apparently you can go home again -- but it'll cost you.You two could rule the world.After her workout Charlotte couldn't help but think about how truly blessed she was. This week had made her feel more grateful than ever for her happy marriage.And while picturing her loved ones at home in New York, she forgot where she was...And opened her mouth.Sweetie -- what's --And just like that, Charlotte Pookeepsed in her pants.Miranda was right -- when something was really, really funny -- I laughed.There was no better time I could think of to hire and assistant.Um, Cathy... You seem drunk.And why do you think you're right for this job?So, you're from St. Louis?Have you ever been a personal assistant?Six kids? What was that like?Aside from the space issue... why'd you move to New York?No, it's just -- so -- honest. I don't think I've ever heard anyone say that in a long time.Well... Louise from St. Louis... I have just one more question. How does an unemployed girl with three roommates afford the Patchwork Denim Bowley Louis Vuitton bag?No! How can I not know about this?And she did hook me up.After only three days -- I began to think of her as Saint Louise from St. Louis.As much as Miranda wanted to pat herself on the back for finding her new apartment in just one afternoon... in the end, she knew --It was a Lovro connection.Yeah, hi, can you put on Samantha?You people and your relationships.At the bottom of the ocean in Mexico.No, not yet. No phone -- no calls, no calls-- no questions, no questions-- no explaining no wedding.Plus, It's an excuse to break out the gloves.When Samantha Jones decides to do something...... She does it all the way.She and Smith did all the upscale L.A. couple things. Sushi...... Spray tanning.... And saving Somalia... Samantha- style.-- Interesting -- so is Carrie Bradshaw.Come on -- When are we going to get to the really important things like unpacking my closet?Yes.Now?So right.Delete.And -- isn't there some cyberspace place that you can send those so that I never have to see an email from him ever again? Do that please.\"And Cinderella and Prince Charming lived happily ever after.\" This is a fairy tall sweetheart. Things don't always happen like this in real life -- you should know that now.And another one bites the dust.Sure. Everything okay?How?Sweetie.I guess, in certain houses, fairy tales do come true.I can't believe you're even dressing up.You said a mouthful there, sister.Speaking of monsters -- I got an email from Big.\"I don't know what to say.\" Ah... then don't send an email.Gonna take a little more than that to scare me after what I have been through.And in the subject box: two words: I'm sorry.Maybe he's sorry.Point taken. I still can't believe this happened to me. I know it happened, but I can't believe it happened. I lay awake at night going over every detail of the last week in my head.And then I saw it...the only thing scary enough to scare me after the experience I'd been through.Wait -- what's that say? In the box at the end?Is what?\"Carrie Bradshaw is still single and living in Manhattan.\"I didn't want to buy it - but I figured it was one less Vogue in New York.Yes -- I'm a beautiful bride. Come in.Hi, honey.For me?And what are you going to be for Halloween?Yea!Look closer. I'm the scariest thing in New York. Jilted at Forty-one. Boo.You know you have to give me some of your loot, right?Louise!That's the point. My head is the witness protection program.And I am feeling that Balenciaga on you.Already?Hold, Hold, Hold. 347? No, no. I'm a 917 gal. Always have been.Great. Now even I don't recognize me.Carrie Bradshaw ---- Or I used to be.I'm a 347 area code. How tacky is that?I want the old New York with the old 917 and my old will to live.Looking?Yes. When I was a 212.And in an effort to stay out of her house and out of trouble -- Samantha went shopping.It certainly wasn't the cutest dog in the pen - but their was something about it --And just as Samantha convinced herself that the dog wasn't for her.No, it's too beautiful. I'll just bury it deep in the back -- like I did my feelings.Every day. You know, it's weird -- I haven't cried very much at all. Maybe you're only allotted a certain amount of tears per man -- and I used mine up.Suddenly, it dawned on me -- there were two broken hearts in my-walk in.Louise -- we need a cocktail. Grab your rental.What happened?Good.Oh, I remember that smile. Who's the guy?At 11:30? That's a bootie call.Louise, I may not get texts and I may not send texts -- but trust me: The sub-text of that text: Bootie.All right, then. You kids enjoy. That's what your twenties are for. Your thirties are to learn the lessons.And your forties are to pay for drinks.It's all about the desk. If I find the desk, the writing will come. And it better `cause I'm using my new book advance to pay the fancy decorator.Out with the old -- -- In with the overpriced.Hey, Harry called me and mentioned you're not running.`Cause he loves you... and he's concerned.Did the doctor say it wasn't safe or something?So, why are you not --But if the doctor said --Okay.Sweetie, you shit your pants this year. Maybe you're done.You run every day -- that's what you do. You can't stop being who you are -- just because you're afraid. Right?Now let's get down to business. I've got to have my apartment done in time for that baby shower.And as the last of the autumn leaves fell away -- so did Charlotte's fear.Yep. I'm perfectly happy spending time home alone. And speaking of home -- you're going to miss your plane.Oh... Louise from St. Louis.Now, I feel bad. If I had known we were going to exchange gifts --I would have bought you one two weeks ago and hidden it in here.Open it.No more rent girl for you.It was the best money I'd ever spent.New Year's Eve... and a Cup O'Soup.Hello?That's sweet but I can't, I'm writing.No. You're not really having a fabulous time are you?Oh yes, that's just what every New Year's Eve party needs: a visit from the lost Bronte sister.Thanks but -- by ten PM I'll be in bed asleep and blissfully unaware of how fabulous this night is supposed to be.Hello.I was sleeping.That's okay. Where's Brady?Right.It's okay. Are you alright?Want me to come over?I can grab a cab --You're not alone.Easy girl.Every year the women of New York leave the past behind and look forward to the future... this is known as Fashion Week.This way. I hear the couture calling my name.Very nice.Well... Not every Saturday.Ah.... yes.Impressive. Better work up a hand gesture to go with it.Well, I'll do my best. We'll talk after?I've gotta go.This was a mistake -- it's too soon -- I'm not ready. I'll go get a coffee and you guys call me after -- and I'll meet you for lunch.Yeah, I really was... until I became the poster child for wounded women everywhere.Is this thing going to effect everything I do for the rest of my life?Where everyone can see me.I didn't know if it was the fashion or the fact that the four of us were together again -- but for the first time in a long time -- I felt like myself.And a couple of weeks later -- I met St. Louise's St. Louis boyfriend, Will.Over Christmas they realized how much they loved each other. Just in time for Valentine's day.Hello?You called an hour too early.Miranda and I are going to dinner and then a really violent slasher movie.And you?Wow. Do you make sushi?Boy, you do have time on your hands.I think it was like this last year but we played for the other team.`Cause -- I'm an emotional cutter. I deserve what I got. Running all over New York believing that I'm finally getting my happy ending. \"See everyone, love does conquer all. Look at me in my one of a kind wedding gown marrying the love of my life.\"And Miranda... in that article -- I did not say \"we\" once. It was all: \"I\" want and \"I\" think.My point of view... Exactly. The whole wedding was my point of view. I let the wedding get bigger than Big. I am the reason he didn't get out of that car.What do you mean?I have been going over this and over this in my mind for five months -- and -- for five months you kept a secret like that?Once? You tried to tell me once? You should have tried to tell me every single day!There is no right time to tell me you ruined my marriage!And I think what hurts the most is that you kept a secret from me. I have never ever kept a secret from you. Ever!No, I'm lying. For the last five months I've been thinking that it's a huge mistake that you left Steve. There. How does it feel?Excuse me!It was the same Valentine night Samantha had planned -- minus the sushi.Three days of \"I'm sorry\" calls and e-mails and flowers -- and I still wasn't ready. It was the longest we'd even gone without speaking.How long have you been waiting here?I'm upset.You know --No.You badger me to forgive you in three days -- and you won't even consider forgiving Steve for something he did six months ago.It's forgiveness.And -- I know you're not the reason my marriage fell apart. I was just - desperate to have someone else to blame.Can you do that?Thinking -- or feeling?Miranda -- you're a lawyer. You can argue both sides of any case -- but, why we feel what we feel -- isn't logical. It's emotional. Sorry, Harvard -- I'm afraid you're going to have to make this decision based on your emotions.You will. There will come a moment when you'll know. And if it's: yes - - all that brilliant logic will go out the window... with the past.Where is it?Very logical. And yet poetic.And I have two coffees.What's the other news?Oh my God --Meanwhile, back in Lost Angeles...... Samantha had money, a career and a man who loved her... Still, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing from her life.With her two weeks just about up, Miranda's list of pros and cons were equal.It suddenly dawned on Miranda that Steve's list might have had more cons then pros.And Miranda never looked back...Well, almost never.And at home -- everything felt and looked different -- and yet still very much me.Sorry. This is a very exclusive party.Thanks.You know her, probably ran to the hotel gym for a quick work-out.Sweetie!And that rat better be house trained.No, a belly on anyone else is a \"so what?\" A belly on Samantha is a: \"So what the hell is going on?\"Never. And when has she ever not talked about every detail regarding her body?Language, please -- this is a grown- up apartment now.How -- and I say this with love -- How could you not realize it?Why didn't you say something?Now, listen -- this isn't about the weight. You'd be gorgeous at any size. But are you happy?I'm pretty sure that's to you.What does your gut tell you?Sweetie... You just compared your relationship to chemo.There we were...the three mirrors Samantha couldn't avoid.And Samantha?That pillow cost three hundred dollars.As someone returned to my life...... Someone left.What am I gonna do without you?St. Louise, you brought me back to life.Wait -- don't forget your \"love.\"I'll meet you in St. Louis.Now, there were no more distractions. And as I moved on...... Samantha moved in.Hi. Congratulations... A girl!Oh my God. She's gorgeous.What a beautiful name.Well, I have to say you two are very cool customers -- just making the \"baby's here\" call without all the \"I'm in labor\" drama.Very dramatic.What?Well -- today is not about him. It's about beautiful baby Rose. So -- we know she has Charlotte's hair -- what else do we know?She's a doll. Mazel tov!Harry -- it's so much more complicated than you can imagine.He's never written me.No. He's never written me. Ever.Two hours, two manila envelopes and countless emails later, I was just about to give up on the Big riddle when --I had told Louise to put Big in a place where I would never have to hear from him again.Hey, Louise -- it's me. What's the password to get into your assistant file? Call me.Shit.Oh my God.As soon as I typed in \"love\" -- there he was.And because Big still didn't have the words... he retyped a love letter from Beethoven.And Lord Byron.And James Joyce.And Voltaire.There they were. \"The Love Letters of Great Men - Volume One.\" Plus one more... Written by John James Preston.I wanted to call him - but our love... Carrie and Big: volumes one, two, and three... stopped me.Hello.No, it's okay I figured it out.I don't need to go over there.Oh -- I completely forgot about --It's already five o'clock.Five twenty-five. Bye.Taxi!The light in our pre-war apartment looked completely different post- war.It wasn't logic -- it was love.Why did we ever decide to get married?I'm sorry to have done that to you... And you know the funny part?We were perfectly happy before we decided to live happily ever after.Good closet.Comfortable. Is this what you had in mind when you installed the carpet?We better get up before the new owner bust in on us.And in the end... Carrie Bradshaw married John James Preston in a label-less dress.Perfect. You and me -- like I said.It wasn't a fancy designer reception either. Just food and friends.Maybe some labels are best left in the closet...... Maybe when we put a label on people... bride, groom, husband, wife, fat, thin, married, single... we forget to look past the label and see the person.Because everyone else started.And speaking of an oldie but goodie...Wait -- wait -- a toast.To Samantha... fifty and fabulous!To us... and the next fifty!And there, in the same city where they met as girls, four New York women entered the next phase of their lives... dressed head to toe in love.And that's the one label -- that never goes out of style.", "clean_line": "year year women come new york city search labels love years ago having gotten

So. You are keeping your own place, right?I just want to make sure you're being smart here --Fine. I'm jealous. You're in real estate heaven and I'm in Brooklyn.Whoever wrote that - lives in Brooklyn.Hey -- what's coming up on Smith's series? Is he going to sleep with that new blonde neurosurgeon?Great. Can't wait.Kinda like Steve and I.I'm kidding. But come one-- it's been seven years. He does that, I do this... It's not like a new plot twist is going to turn up.She's bidding for someone on the phone.... and I'm deaf.There is literally a ringing in my ear.Where is he with the check?I still have a legal brief to work on when I get home.What? I'm sorry. I'm exhausted. Brady woke me up at five AM.It's like you're always criticizing me.Yeah. Yeah.Yeah. Yeah.It's late... let's just get it over with.I mean -- We have to get up in four and half hours.Steve... We have sex.How often do you guys have sex?What?She's three, she doesn't know what it means. I'm forty- two and I still don't know what it means.Fine. How often do you guys...Steve and I were \"coloring\" last night and just as I was about to --He wanted to change positions and I said... \"Let's just get it over with.\"Well, he kept trying to make it last longer.It is when you have a full-time job.Well, you don't also have a five year old and play groups and PTA and a mother-in-law in a rest home with advancing Alzheimer's. I'm telling you, at the end of the day all I want to do is sleep. The most exciting thing in bed now -- is the bed.We're just going through a no coloring phase -- it comes and goes, right?Great. Now I feel worse.Six months ago.But that's a dry spell.Well, this was very helpful.I can't believe it sold so fast.Oh, you know me -- I'm your daughter-in-law. I'm Miranda.While I run over to see your mother tomorrow maybe you can take him to the first birthday party alone. Then -- I'll meet you at the twins' party and you can leave and be at the bar by six.What's the matter? Steve.It's killing you?!Do not follow me.Surprise -- Here we are!We are too. Aren't we B-boy?Here. Mommy has to go to the bathroom.Apparently you don't have sex for six months he runs out and has it with some girl at his bar.Steve. When I think of everything I've done for him. And this is how he repays me. Man, if I didn't have Brady, I would never go back there.Is it?Yes, it's sad, but I'm not going to make it any sadder by staying at a bad hotel while I look for a place. Pass the salt.Plus, I have to be downtown and close to Brooklyn. We're going to keep things as normal for Brady as we can. I'll pick him up on my days... take him over on Steve's.Says he's devastated -- begs me to forgive him. Not going to happen. I can barely even look at him.Well, even if I could get my head around that justification -- it's the cheating part -- the behind my back part... the violation of the trust -- that's the thing that's killing me.Besides... women who stay with men who cheat are women who are afraid to be on their own. And that's not me -- I can handle it. Always could.I don't know if Steve's mentioned anything to you yet -- about us. Has he?Well -- we've had some marriage problems -- it's not necessary to go into the details but -- I just wanted you to know that we won't be coming to see you together anymore. I'll be here Monday, Wednesday and Sunday -- the other days will be Steve.Hi. I haven't talked to you all night.Could you give us --What could you possibly have to say that could make it better?You broke us! You broke us. What we had is broken!I changed who I was for you.No, I'm not alright. You two are crazy to get married. Marriage ruins everything.After the fifteenth?Is that a rip?Traffic was the worst --I did something really bad -- I think.I said something to Big. At the rehearsal dinner.It was right after Steve showed up. I was upset... Big came up to me -- and I said something like: You're crazy to get married. It just came out.Do you think it was totally the reason?I keep thinking I should tell Carrie.What?I can't go to Mexico. I have a job.Oh My God!No more honeymoon stuff. This is very important. Have I made myself clear?Magda -- I'll talk to you tomorrowMorning.It's a five-star resort.The sun feels nice.-- What? I didn't know I was going to be in a swimsuit.I forgot to get a wax.I've had other things on my mind.Well, when you're married, Samantha -- you have a different set of priorities.So what -- It's my fault?! I let the sex go out of our marriage! I deserve what I got. Thanks for understanding.I'm fine!Don't look to your --Charlotte had pudding in her Prada.Yes.When something is really, really funny.No, that's marriage.No-- I think we're on their honeymoon.It's all so hot -- three days in.Was that what that was?I thought it was just feathers.And good guys do bad things. The good guys screw you and the bad guys screw you.And that was all Steve had -- didn't have money -- didn't have a career. He was the good guy bartender with a big dick.Nine. Like -- nine and change.Good news. Just got an e mail from your buyer's attorney -- they have agreed to sell you back your old apartment at that escalated price. And \"are willing to vacate by the time you return -- pending an additional financial offer.\"Did you --No, I can't be more patient. Your agency has had three weeks to find me an apartment.No -- I told you... It has to be in Manhattan. Because it does.How hard could it be to find something just on the other side of the Brooklyn Bridge?On second thought -- Forget it. I could do a better job myself.According to New York Magazine, this is the new up-and-coming neighborhood.See! Wherever he's going is where we need to be.Coming or going?Going. Oh boy. Lets go.Hi. I'm interested in the apartment.I understand but -- who would I talk to about it?Lovro... -- and I have no idea. Ku...No way.No way -- You dated?He's single?All the parents at Brady's school dress up -- it's fun! Fun thought up by a group of non-working mothers with nothing else to do all day.Witch and -- \"sexy kitten\". That's it? The only two choices for women. Witch and Sexy kitten.Maybe I should just wear this and a business suit and go as myself.What were you expecting?Steve is all about \"I'm sorry.\" I'm sorry emails -- I'm sorry voice mails -- I'm sorry flowers -- I'm sorry cards. How about: don't do anything to be: \" I'm sorry\" for.Maybe Big is too.Carrie -- There's a detail I've been meaning to tell you about --You look great, you look amazing. So. That's the worst of it.\"Editor's note: The wedding of Carrie Bradshaw and John James Preston was cancelled as this issue went to press. Carrie Bradshaw is...And what are you gonna say at midnight?That's right -- but you gotta say it more excited than that -- \"Happy New Year!\"You say that and then... you kiss.Did you pack the new Batman Santa brought you?It's there near the tree.We're all kinda staying in tonight.No, thank you.There he is. Batman.Happy New Year.See you tomorrow.I thought one of the perks of having a family is you don't have to spend New Year's Eve alone with Chinese food. I'm alone with Chinese food.Oh, shit -- I'm sorry.It's Steve's night.Go back to sleep -- don't wake up.I'm fine -- I was just getting a little choked-up watching the stupid New Year's Eve stuff on TV alone.I'm all the way downtown --On New Year's Eve? No way. I'm fine... really.I just wanted to talk a little. Go back to sleep. Good night.-- In your four billion dollar beach house.There's Mayor Bloomberg.I believe that was his last campaign slogan.So, this is how you all spent your Saturdays while I was with Brady and Steve at the Brooklyn Aquarium.Just so you know -- We always had front row at the mammal show. Steve does the funniest dolphin impression. Actually, it's more -- Steve as a dolphin --Are you suggesting something?And are you also suggesting that she forgive Big?Should I --Is it me or is Valentine's Day this year on steroids?I could do a lot worse.Why would you look at the Vogue today of all days?It was from your point of view.You can't put this all on yourself. Okay. I said something I shouldn't have said to Big at the rehearsal dinner.I was really upset after Steve showed up and I bumped into Big and -- I said that you two were crazy to get married.Stop -- It's fine -- Thanks.I'm sorry, I was upset-- Steve had--I tried to tell you once but the Vogue article came out --I know, I was looking for the right time.It just happened -- I wasn't thinking.Carrie, please -- Don't go -- I --It's me. Pick up. Are you there?Carrie.Hi. I need to talk to you.Seventeen dollars long. Please get in. It just turned to eighteen.Carrie, I understand -- but it just happened -- I never meant to hurt you. You have to forgive me.What?Please. What were you going to say?It's not the same thing.I don't know if I can trust that it won't happen again.Me?!So, we're done with our last session and we're not allowed to talk for two weeks while we figure out if being together again is something we really want. And then - - we had to pick a place to meet -- and if we both show up on that day - - the past no longer exists. Showing up is the promise we make to each other that we're willing to let it all go and move forward.I don't know. I have a lot of thinking to do.What do you mean?Well, then -- I'm screwed. I don't know what I feel.And I thought picking the place to meet was a challenge.The Brooklyn Bridge. Halfway between both our places.Poetic -- if we both show up. Otherwise -- you're on a bridge -- rejected. Not a good plan.Kiss me.We're on the list. Miranda Hobbes plus one...and a half.Where's Samantha? Her plane landed two hours ago.There's a rat in your purse.So, she has a belly. So what?What -- like a fat intervention? \"We love you -- have a salad?\" No. We should let her bring it up.What exactly are you eating?When was the last time you felt happy?Why did we ever stop drinking these?", "clean_line": "bought going live ll keeping place right want sure smart fine jealous real estate heaven brooklyn wrote lives brooklyn hey coming smith series going sleep new blonde neurosurgeon great wait kinda like steve kidding come seven years like new plot twist going turn bidding phone deaf literally ringing ear check legal brief work home sorry exhausted brady woke like criticizing yeah yeah yeah yeah late let mean half hours steve sex guys sex know means know means fine guys steve coloring night wanted change positions said let kept trying longer time job year old play groups pta mother law rest home advancing alzheimer telling end day want sleep exciting thing bed bed going coloring phase comes goes right great feel worse months ago dry spell helpful believe sold fast oh know daughter law miranda run mother tomorrow maybe birthday party ll meet twins party leave bar matter steve killing follow surprise aren boy mommy bathroom apparently sex months runs girl bar steve think ve repays man brady yes sad going sadder staying bad hotel look place pass salt plus downtown close brooklyn going things normal brady ll pick days steve says devastated begs forgive going happen barely look head justification cheating violation trust thing killing women stay men cheat women afraid handle know steve mentioned ve marriage problems necessary details wanted know won coming anymore ll monday wednesday sunday days steve hi haven talked night possibly better broke broke broken changed alright crazy married marriage ruins fifteenth rip traffic worst bad think said big rehearsal dinner right steve showed upset big came said like crazy married came think totally reason thinking tell carrie mexico job oh god honeymoon stuff important clear magda ll talk tomorrowmorning star resort sun feels nice know going swimsuit forgot wax ve things mind married samantha different set priorities fault let sex marriage deserve got thanks understanding fine look charlotte pudding prada yes funny marriage think honeymoon hot days thought feathers good guys bad things good guys screw bad guys screw steve money career good guy bartender big dick like change good news got mail buyer attorney agreed sell old apartment escalated price willing vacate time return pending additional financial offer patient agency weeks apartment told manhattan hard brooklyn bridge second thought forget better job according new york magazine new coming neighborhood going need coming going going oh boy lets hi interested apartment understand talk lovro idea ku way way dated single parents brady school dress fun fun thought group non working mothers day witch sexy kitten choices women witch sexy kitten maybe wear business suit expecting steve sorry sorry emails sorry voice mails sorry flowers sorry cards sorry maybe big carrie ve meaning tell look great look amazing worst editor note wedding carrie bradshaw john james preston cancelled issue went press carrie bradshaw gonna midnight right gotta excited happy new year kiss pack new batman santa brought near tree kinda staying tonight thank batman happy new year tomorrow thought perks having family spend new year eve chinese food chinese food oh shit sorry steve night sleep wake fine getting little choked watching stupid new year eve stuff tv way downtown new year eve way fine wanted talk little sleep good night billion dollar beach house mayor bloomberg believe campaign slogan spent saturdays brady steve brooklyn aquarium know row mammal steve funniest dolphin impression actually steve dolphin suggesting suggesting forgive big valentine day year steroids lot worse look vogue today days point view okay said shouldn said big rehearsal dinner upset steve showed bumped big said crazy married stop fine thanks sorry upset steve tried tell vogue article came know looking right time happened wasn thinking carrie pick carrie hi need talk seventeen dollars long turned eighteen carrie understand happened meant hurt forgive going thing know trust won happen session allowed talk weeks figure want pick place meet day past longer exists showing promise willing let forward know lot thinking mean screwed know feel thought picking place meet challenge brooklyn bridge halfway places poetic bridge rejected good plan kiss list miranda hobbes plus half samantha plane landed hours ago rat purse belly like fat intervention love salad let bring exactly eating time felt happy stop drinking"}, "SAMANTHA": {"raw_line": "Samantha Jones... Smith Jerrod's manager -- I'm in New York `till Monday.Fabulous. Let's go in -- I am so excited!There it is. My baby.When I saw this in the catalogue I said to Smith: This flower ring is the essence of me. One of a kind, filled with fire...Exactly. Come on. Let's go spend some of my hard-earned Hollywood money.He sleeps with every hot woman doctor in that hospital.No, I think it's hot. Sometimes, when I'm alone, I masturbate right along with them.Besides, it's fake sex. When they're doing it -- no one's actually turned on.Bitch.I deserve this. I work hard.Sex with only one man for I don't know how long.Fifty fucking thousand!I draw the line at fifty.... Till they weren'tSamantha Jones--Oh, honey... you finally got Botox.I'm telling you, Carrie -- you'll love it.I'm just saying.Right.Really?That's great.Well, honey -- I am excited for you but -- you know me... I don't really believe in marriage.... Botox on the other hand -- That works every time.Honey, I've got to go. The People magazine person is on hold. Smith's on the short list to be their \"Sexiest Man Alive.\" We can catch up when I'm in town next week.I think I was in shock. I mean, it's you getting married. This is not some random person -- it's you.And I guess, I thought that after that big mess with Aidan -- you'd never want to get married.So, I put you in my \"we're never getting married\" file. Now, I've got to take you out of that file.You'll get my bill.Well, I'm happy for you.The same way you feel about Botox. Painful and unnecessary.If I knew the girl talk was going to be on \"lock down,\" I wouldn't have flown two thousand miles.Well, I can't color enough. I would color all day -- every day if I had my way. I'd use every crayon in my box.Come? Sorry -- there is no crayon equivalent.And this is bad?I have a full-time job.Well, when was the last time for you?I bet it is.Send it to Smith Jerrod at the office address.I've got to go. Something just came up.So far, I like it.How did -- Wait -- that was you on the phone at the auction?But I was going to buy it for myself.Right.To be clear -- This is a ring with diamonds -- not a diamond ring, right? In that case... I love it. It's my second favorite thing I've ever found in there.Now, my gift's a little bit more... oral.Bed? It's seven-thirty.This is how it starts. Next thing you know... we're only having sex three or four times a week.I am not most people.She's looking quite at home for someone who didn't think she had the bride gene.I lot of shit went down in this place. Attention must be payed!Miranda, honey -- are you sure you want to do this? It's just one time. Anyone can have a slip.It's a little quick to move out, don't you think?He had sex once. Not even an affair.That's what she said.Are you waiting for me to get out my datebook?You want me to tell you if I'm going to have sex? Fine. I'm about to have sex.Now, I know it's tradition at the rehearsal dinner for the maid of honor to reveal embarrassing things about the bride. But in our group --... We never kiss and tell.So, I'd like to make a toast to the groom.Hey \"dick wad\"... I'm speaking.Now. There were times when we had our doubt about this gorgeous man. But after careful observation over the last hundred years, my doubts are over. So... here's to the groom. A man who finally got \"Carrie-d\" away.Well, you're quite a guy.Steve.Steve's here.You thought that after the second break-up?Yes, but... after the break-ups -- comes the hot make-up sex.Are you sure she's not my child?There's so much fabric I can't see.Ready. We're ready.Who's not?Big's not here.What do you mean he's not coming?Go, go. You take her. I'll stay here and deal with this --What the hell got into him? He was perfectly fine at the dinner.Why didn't you say anything?Oh, honey -- I can hire people to do all that. Anything you need.I can get you out of that. Worse comes to worse -- I'll say there was a death or something.Well, turns out, I couldn't get her out of the honeymoon -- but I got us in.I just booked us three seats on the flight. Mexico here we come.Buenos dias.Honey, you'll be waiting for a long time.We'll talk.This... will kill her. Where is she?Well, it's a gorgeous sunset.Honey, you have to eat a little breakfast.Eat something and you can go back to sleep.With all this gorgeous fresh food you're just going to eat that pudding crap the entire trip?Jesus, honey. Wax much?Since when -- 1998?I could be on death row and not have that situation.Honey don't blame marriage -- This one's married -- and she's not growing a national forest. How do you even cross your legs? Let me make you a spa appointment -- Any thicker and you won't be able to find it.Honey, I'm sorry. That's not what --Oh, honey... you made a little joke. Good for you.Felix -- We'll start with quatro margaritas.Fabulous -- and keep them coming.Well, as long as we're going down this road.I can't believe my life revolves around a man. On what planet did I allow that to happen?Does that mean saying his name fifty times more a day than I say my own? Does it mean worrying about him and his needs before me and mine? Is it all about the other person? Is that love?Even this ring. I wanted to buy this for myself. That meant something to me. To be able to do that. Then, he buys it for me.Yes. But now, every time I look down at it... I see him. Not me.No, you could look at it and see that. I'm Samantha.We'll take another round.Relax -- we're on vacation.And the rest of them don't know how to screw you. Trust me-- I've done the leg work.How big?Eat your pudding.You can't forgive a man with a dick over nine inches? Well, honey, if you can't -- some other woman will.And a bottle of tequila.No time like the present.Now -- lets work on getting your things there.That's locked -- Use the other--That was really hot.Distant? You're still in me.When have I ever wanted to talk about it?It's more than that -- lately, I haven't been feeling a connection to --No -- to -- it -- here. I have no real connection to our life here.Not every chance I get. Only for the A-list things. And my managing you -- it's all too much. I'm starting to resent it. For the last two years it's been all about you.I know. That was so much more fun.So, I won't be coming to New York for a while. We're going to spend some time reconnecting on the weekends... do the \"LA couple thing.\"Really. At first I was all: \"You can't tell me what I can do\" -- but then, I had to admit he had a point.Honey, a pay phone? Where's your cell?Want me to hook you up with a new one?Samantha Jones.Talk to me.347 is the new New York.Old New York, new New York -- honey -- at least it's New York.Another hard thing about being in L.A? My \"sex on a stick\" next door neighbor. I can't stop looking at him.Just looking. After I saw Steve's face at the rehearsal dinner, I could never ---But you should see this guy. Every night sex with a different partner. He's like -- --Me. Five years ago.And she needs a little eye work. Anything you can do about these stains?Honey, I don't mince words.Thanks -- Three months driving in L.A. and I forgot how to use my fucking legs.See this -- this is what I miss. Last night Smith and I cuddled in front of the TV with \"take out\" Mexican.Still -- I don't think I'm cut out for the one-on-one relationship thing.No, see -- I've always had girlfriends on the side.New Yorkers are so damn attractive - - Even the Mayor is hot.There we are.I pulled some strings.I should go thank them --We thought we were leaving.Let's get a cab -- I am starv --God, I miss New York.I'm just calling to make sure you aren't hanging from your shower rod.So, what's the V-day plan?Perfect.I am making Smith sushi. Pause for reaction.We took a class a while back -- and when he walks in the door at seven- thirty, I am going to surprise him by laying on the dining room table - -- covered with homemade sushi.You are three hours late.Yes, I ate. I ate the sushi that I hand made for you. The sushi that I planned to lay all over my naked body as a Valentines surprise for you.I slaved away in a kitchen all day to make this meal for you.Not a big deal?You see this -- This took me five fucking hours!I am not the type of woman who sits home all day waiting for a man! You love California so much -- enjoy your hand-made California roll!No! Come back here.Where are you, baby?Sorry -- I'm your neighbor and my dog ran up on your dick-- --Deck!Smith is interested - but the dates will have to work with the series.We agreed that no one else from the show but Smith was going to be on the cover.There's no place like home.Did you ever think you'd see the day -- me with a pooch.Ladies, we can talk about my gut later-- right now, I'm bored to tears here.I eat -- so I won't cheat.Everything except Dante's dick.I guess I didn't realize how big I was until I saw it on your faces.I've been avoiding mirrors.I don't know if there's anything to be proud of. I stuff my face to stop myself from doing something that feels natural to me.I guess I didn't want to admit it. And when you're in denial -- you don't dial.Relationships aren't always about being happy, right? How often do you feel happy in your relationship?You feel happy ever day?Six months ago.What am I going to do?I know but -- Smith stayed with me through chemo. If he could stay with me through that, I should be able to stay in this relationship for him.We need to talk.Yeah. This isn't working. I've done my best. I've given it five years and fifteen pounds.Yes, I love you - ah, fuck it -- I'm just gonna say the thing you're not supposed to say -- I love you but I love me more.
