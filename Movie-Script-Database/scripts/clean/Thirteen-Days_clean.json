{"Thirteen-Days": {"KENNY": {"raw_line": "Hi, hon.Kids are supposed to get detention.Secretary of Defense...Wrong, and you get to wax my car.Nope. Attorney General?All right, wise guys, Assistant Secretary of State for Latin America...Morning, Floyd.Top o' the morning, Mr. President.Bayh's going to lose, but it's good groundwork for us for '64.No you weren't.Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...Who else you got?Got the touch?Everyone likes a good kid...Busy. But you've got his heart.I said his heart, not his attention.Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.We're giving the Brits Polaris instead. But a story'll just aggravate things.Not today. He's got tight schedule.Forget it, Scotty.All right, you're in. Half hour.Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.Morning, Floyd.What's it about?Just Cuba? Okay, I got work to do, see you guys downstairs.Listen to me, you worthless piece of disloyal shit. You will pull Daly's man on the circuit. You owe your goddamn job to this administration. There is a word you need to learn. It is the only word in politics. Loyalty. LOYALTY you motherfucking piece of shit!What're you looking at? This isn't the blessed order of St. Mary the Meek.Excuse us.Not as far as the election goes.We hit a Nazi buzz bomb field in '45. It looks like a rocket base...Jesus Christ in Heaven...The principals are assembling in an hour. See you then.Should be here any minute.Who gives a shit about the midterms now? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us.Jesus. I feel like we've caught the Jap carriers steaming for Pearl Harbor.Lyndon. Adlai.Ted.If we hit 'em, kill a lot of Russians, they'll move against Berlin. They attack Berlin, that's NATO... and we're at war.There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.The other thing is...They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.It's too politicized with you in there, anyway. They need to be able to stick their necks out.EXCOM. Has a ring to it. Like F-Troop.Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule - your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State. Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.Way it's going, the Democratic Party. DNC strategy session. If you can call it that.Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.What is it?I ask for a lot of 'em. Whose is it?Gotta go, Scotty. See you tomorrow.Jesus Christ Almighty...Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.There is no expert on this subject, no wise old man.Then let's bomb the shit out of them. Everyone wants to, even you, even me. It sure would feel good.He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.He was.Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day.I was hoping LeMay pushed you. I wouldn't mind going a few rounds with him.They're planning to shave you bald next time you fall asleep on the bus. Sorry, Pierre, Gromyko just arrived.Come on, Scotty. This meeting's been on the books for months. It's just a friendly talk on U.S.-Soviet relations.We go into this split, the Russians will know it. And they'll use it against us.You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.No way.I'm not calling and cancelling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly.Damn right I'm scared.What are you telling them?Tell 'em you've looked into it, and all it is is an exercise. And Pierre -- The President may have a cold tomorrow.Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.Cuba? You're fucking crazy. We are not invading Cuba. Nobody gives a rat's ass about Cuba. Not now, not ever. If you print something like that, all you're going to do is inflame the situation. Nobody talks to assholes who inflame situations. Assholes like that can find themselves cut out of the loop.Tell Pierre I need to talk to him. Bobby?We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.As the town's most popular playboy, the President felt my presence would be sorely missed. So in the interests of National Security...We're not going to make it to Monday. I'll try to lean on Reston, but you're going to have to call Orville Dryfoos. This is the sort of decision the publisher makes himself.Acheson called, DeGaulle's with us; haven't heard from anyone else yet.You'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional support.This is all rhetoric. They don't know how to respond yet.-- run the blockade. They'll run the blockade.I don't like what's happening.All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...What about these low-level flights? They're starting in what? An hour? Do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?Fair enough. But Castro's on alert and we're flying attack planes over their sites, on the deck. There's no way for them to know they're carrying cameras, not bombs. They're going to be shot at, plain and simple.I'm your political advisor, and I'm giving you political analysis here. This is a setup. The Chiefs want to go in. It's the only way they can redeem themselves for the Bay of Pigs. They have to go in, and they have to do it right. It's that simple.They're boxing us in with these rules of engagement. If you agree to 'em, and one of our planes gets knocked down or one of the ships won't stop for inspection, the Chiefs will have us by the balls and will force us to start shooting. They want a war, and they're arranging things to get one. If you don't want one, we have to do something about it.Maybe it's harder for them to say it than they let on. At the very least, they believe it's in our best interest. And at the end of the day, they may end up being right.That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...Ma'am, would you mind helping me out with a few special calls?Commander, my name is Ken O'Donnell. Special Assistant to the President.The President has instructed me to pass along an order to you. You are not to get shot down.I don't think you understand me correctly. You are not to get shot down under any circumstances. Whatever happens up there, you were not shot at. Mechanical failures are fine; crashing into mountains, fine. But you and your men are not to be shot at, fired at, launched upon.Commander, if you are fired upon, the President will be forced to attack the sites that fire on you. He doesn't want to have to do that. It's very important that he doesn't, or things could go very badly out of control.If the President protects you, Commander, he may have to do it with the Bomb.I've known the man for fifteen years. The problem is, he will protect you. So I'm asking: don't make him protect you. Don't get shot at.Yeah?Hello?The Chiefs must want to talk to you. Listen to me, Commander, they'll want to know if you were fired on. Were you?Commander. Do not, under any circumstances, tell the Chiefs.I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.I'll be evacuated with the President.I'll find you. But we're not going to let it come to that. I promise.Helen just asked me what sort of arrangements we have for the families.How long will it take to get someone up?No. No, I'll let her sleep. Let 'em sleep.They're right. This is intentional.Khruschev's stopped the 20 ships which are carrying contraband, and he's letting the ones which aren't go through, hoping for an incident. I think we should let them go.Then we deal with it tomorrow. But today he's stopped most of them. He's done something smart here. We gave him an ultimatum, and he's agreed to most of it, preserving just enough room to save face. We need to do something just as smart now.Give it a rest. You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat.Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.Then let's move the quarantine line.Moving the line. Stroke of genius.The Chiefs are looking for a provocation out there. The President's going to come under enormous pressure. You have to keep 'em on a short leash, Bob.Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has. Besides me.You need to be the best you've ever been.Find out how close our exercises are coming to their cruise missiles. I'm calling you back in five, and you will have an answer for me or I will come down there and beat the shit out of you. Then you can press charges, and I'll get a Presidential pardon.Jesus...We can't do that, Bobby.And we can't purge the Chiefs. Our invasion talk will look like a bluff. Or even that there's been an attempted coup.We've got Khruschev's attention with the blockade. If we want a political solution. I think it's time to turn up the diplomatic heat. Cause if we let this go on too long, we're going to find ourselves in a war.I think it's a bad idea.Then they should speak up.Yes it is.-- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.No, they just lack 'moral toughness.' And you think I'll play your Judas. You WASPS and blue-bloods never understood us, thinking we want into your club. Well we got our own club now. And you guys don't realize fighting with each other is our way. Nobody plays us off each other. And nobody ever gets between us...Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba.If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.Then somebody'd better deny it publicly.Yeah, a good political solution.You can't take him out this late in the game.Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.Something your father would've come up with.-- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad.Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score.Adlai, it's Kenny. How're you doing?The President told me to pass the word to you: stick it to them.Adlai. The world has to know we're right. If we're going to have a chance at a political solution, we need international pressure. You got to be tough, Adlai. You need to find it, old friend.Yeah. Yeah.Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time.Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.Who's he talking for? Is it Khruschev, or is this more bullshit?How do you become the KGB top spy in the United States?Politics is politics. Walter. Khruschev is the Moscow Party Boss under Stalin. Give me their career chronologies!Every time Khruschev moves up, Fomin does within a year... Khruschev was the administrator in charge of preparing Moscow's defenses during the war. And Fomin... was here in the U.S.They know each other. They're war buddies.Hello?They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence... Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.It's ten pages of sentimental fluff, but he's saying right here. He'll remove the missiles in return for a no-invasion pledge. It looks like Fomin's overture was genuine.Hi.-- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won.Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.What does the letter say?Jesus Christ...We can't sell out one of our friends for our own safety. NATO wouldn't trust us anymore, and they'd be right not to.Major, my name is Kenneth O'Donnell. Special Assistant to the President.Major, a few days ago the President ordered me to help him keep control of what's going on out there. I've been browbeating pilots, navy guys left and right to make sure you don't get us here in Washington into trouble. But you know what? We're pretty damn good at getting ourselves into trouble. So instead of riding your ass, I'm just going to tell you what's going on, and let you figure out how best to help us out up here.Last night, we looked like we were going to cut a deal to get us all out of this mess. Today, the Soviets are reneging. We're going to try to salvage the situation, but a lot of things are going wrong today. It's making everyone nervous, and it will be very hard to avoid going to war. Don't get shot down, Major. Beyond that, whatever else you can do to help us, I'd really appreciate it.Thank you, Major.It could be a mistake.We need to be positive before we react.Hey, sport. You winning?Yeah, Kev. Everything's gonna be fine.I, uh...Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.Back to work.If we're going to make a deal, we're going to have to do it fast. This is only getting out of control. The only reason we're not at war this very minute is he's been able to stretch, bend and break his own rules. He won't be able to keep it up forever.And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.-- Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I told you how stupid it was to float the Lippman article! But you wouldn't listen to me. What if there hasn't been a coup at all? What if it's you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade?And if the two of you are thinking this trade is your ace in the hole, you're so wrong. It's a deuce.And it's not just me who thinks that. Everyone on this so-called EXCOM is telling you exactly the same thing: make the trade, and they're going to force us into trade after trade until finally they demand something we won't trade like Berlin, and we do end up in a war. Not to mention, that long before that happens, this government will be politically dead.So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.I agree. If there has been a coup, and there's a hard-line government in power now, then it doesn't matter what we say. The end of the day we'll either agree to their terms, they'll agree to ours, or we'll go to war. But what if there hasn't been a coup? What if... what if what is happening is a series of accidents?No. The letter is an intentional, but it's having an effect far greater than its authors intended. What if our Jupiter missiles are just a last minute haggle to salvage something? Maybe a bone Khruschev is throwing to the hard line, not really caring if we reject it or not? And then these accidents have happened.Exactly. If they're sane and human like we are, then maybe we just refuse, and they'll let it slide, like we've been letting things slide.No. We don't reject it...And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.Six months from now, I'm not going to care. Are you? We'll deal with it.And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.Hey, Joe. Listen, I'll take care of him. Go ahead in, grab some coffee. We'll be back pretty quick.What's the matter with you? Forget how to open a car door?Jesus, you rich people.There's nobody else I'd rather have going in there.Nobody else I'd trust Helen and the kids' lives to.Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.You're right about the smart part, but ruthless, well...Smoke.I'll whistle up some luck for you.The friend.All he had was his character.-- he kept the peace.No. I'm glad I'm home.If the sun rises in the morning, it is only because of men of goodwill. And that's all there is between us and the Devil.Yeah?Don't you understand?The sun came up today.It shouldn't have. But it did.Every day the sun comes up... says something about us.Something... amazing.You know......this was what we're here for.", "clean_line": "hi hon kids supposed detention secretary defense

{"raw_line": "Morning, Kenny. You see this goddamn Capehart stuff?I was eating that.I was, you bastard.So what've we got today?I think you should come in here.Still think Cuba isn't important?You used to look down a bomb sight for a living, Ken. What do you see?Where's Bobby?Good.Good.In here!Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?Good morning, gentlemen.Dean, good morning.Bob. Bet you had a late night.Max.Okay. Let's have it.Arthur. Are. You. Sure?Is there any indication - anything at all - that suggests they intend to use these missiles in some sort of first strike?Do we have any sort of intelligence from CIA on what Khruschev is thinking?Gentlemen, I want first reactions. Assuming for a moment Khruschev has not gone off the deep end and intends to start World War Three, what are we looking at?Bob?It's clear we cannot permit Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba. We must get those missiles out.I don't think it's going to matter what Khruschev's intentions are. I tell you, right now... I don't see any way around hitting them.No choice. This is going to cost lives any way we go. Do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. We have to get rid of those missiles.So if there are alternatives that make sense - and I'm not saying there are - we need 'em. Need 'em fast.We can't worry about everything right now. We've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it.Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast. You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.Find him, Kenny. We're going to need all the help we can get.An invasion...Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?Dean. What do you think?Then it appears we have three options. Number one. A surgical air strike against the missiles themselves. Two, a larger air strike against their air defenses along with the missiles.And three, invasion.We're certainly going to do number one; we're going to take out these missiles, so it seems to me we don't have to wait very long. We ought to at least be making those preparations.Dean, how does this play out?Those plans call for the use of nuclear weapons. And what is the next step?Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.The thing is, Acheson's right. Talk alone won't accomplish anything.Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy.There's something...immoral about abandoning your own judgement.We can't let things get ahead of themselves. We've got to control what happens. We're going to do what we have to make this come out right. EXCOM is our first weapon. We'll resort to others as we need 'em.Doesn't anybody in Connecticut have to work today?Let's get out of here.How long until the army is ready?General LeMay, do you truly believe that's our best course of action?General, what will the Soviets do when we attack?Nothing?Those aren't just missiles we'll be destroying. We kill Soviet soldiers, and they will respond. How would we respond if they killed ours? No, they will do something, General, I promise you that. And I believe it'll be Berlin.We knew it was coming. I tell you, Kenny, these brass hats have one big advantage. We do what they want us to, none of us will be alive to tell 'em they were wrong.We keep 'em in the dark as long as we can. But I sure as hell am going to test him.So that there should be no misunderstanding, the position of the United States, which has been made clear by the Attorney General to Ambassador Dobrynin here, I shall read a sentence from my own statement to the press dated September 13th. Should missiles or offensive weapons be placed in Cuba, it would present the gravest threat to U.S. national security.So I do not misunderstand you: there are no offensive weapons in Cuba.Lying bastard. Lied to my face.I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.Have you cancelled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?I don't care. Cancel it.You're scared to cancel on Daly.Well, I'm not.Quarantine or air strike.I don't think that's possible, Adlai. I will be asking the networks for air time Monday night. I have not yet made my final decision. We will announce our course of action then. I want to thank you all for your advice, gentlemen.Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.We've got bigger problems right now.I don't know. I don't know.I'm asking you to hold the story until I can present our course of action on Monday night.Orville. I want you to tell them this: they'll be saving lives. Maybe even including their own.Cam, can you guarantee me you'll get all the missiles?As of seven o'clock Monday night, all United States armed forces world wide will stand up to DEFCON 3.They want this fucking job, they can have it. It's no great joy to me.The elected representatives of the people have spoken... Now let's tell the people...Good evening, my fellow citizens. This Government, as promised, has maintained the closest surveillance of the Soviet military build-up on the island of Cuba......unmistakable evidence has now established the fact that a series of missile sites is in preparation on that imprisoned island. The purpose of these bases can be none other than to proved a nuclear strike capability against the Western Hemisphere...Therefore, in the defense of our own security and under the authority of the Constitution, I have directed that the following initial steps be taken. First, to halt this offensive build-up, a strict quarantine ---- on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated. All ships of any kind bound for Cuba, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, will be turned back. Second: I have directed the continued and increased close surveillance of Cuba and its military build-up. Should these offensive military preparations continue, further action will be justified ---- I have directed the Armed Forces to prepare for any eventualities.And third: it shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba against any nation in the Western Hemisphere as an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States, requiring a full retaliatory response upon the Soviet Union...So now you're Khurschev. What do you do?There will be no shooting without my explicit orders. Is that understood?Well, Admiral, it looks like it's up to the Navy.General, have we developed any more information on the missiles?In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.I know, I know...We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.I'm gonna protect those pilots.How does a man get to a place where he can say, 'throw those lives away,' so easily?Triple check everything the Chiefs say to us with the guys who actually have to do it. No one's to know about this but Bobby. I need redundant control over what happens out there. And if things aren't as advertised, you're going to make sure they come out the way I want them to come out, starting with this low level flight thing.Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.-- we need this one, Dean. The quarantine's legal if we get a mandate, otherwise it's an act of war in the eyes of the world. Get me that vote. Make it unanimous.-- unanimous, Dean.About time something went our way.Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?All right. Then I guess it's time.In accordance with this afternoon's vote at the OAS, the quarantine shall hereby be effective as of ten o'clock tomorrow morning.Last summer I read a book. The Guns of August. I wish every man on that blockade line had read that book.World War One. Thirteen million killed all because the militaries of both alliances were so highly attuned to each other's movements and dispositions, afraid of letting the other guy have a theoretical advantage. And your man in the field, his family at home, couldn't even tell you the reasons why their lives were being sacrificed. Why couldn't they stop it?And here we are, fifty years later. One of their ships resists the inspection. We shoot out its rudder and board. They shoot down our planes in response. We bomb their anti-aircraft sites in response to that. They attack Berlin. We invade Cuba. They fire their missiles. We fire ours.Okay, Bob, I'm putting you on intercom.Bob, the quarantine is now in effect.Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first?Put me through to the Pierce.Captain, can you force that submarine to the surface for inspection without damaging it yourself?Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.Captain, belay that order! Bob, where's that coming from!Will somebody find out what's going on?!Captain, have the ships you're observing changed course?Captain, I want you to maintain contact with those ships. Do nothing until I order otherwise. Is that clear?I hope you're right.We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.-- how the goddamn hell did this happen? I'm going to have Power's head on a platter next to LeMay's! Hey, Kenny, did you hear me give the order to go to DEFCON 2? I remember giving the order to go to DEFCON 3, but I must be suffering from amnesia because I've just been informed our nuclear forces are DEFCON 2!-- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!General, the Joint Chiefs have just signalled our intent to escalate to the Soviets. You have signalled an escalation which I had no wish to signal, and which I did not approve.Get out of here, Max.He's right, we can't rescind DEFCON 2. The Soviets will think we've gotten sweet on them.I've been considering a variation on one of Stevenson's ideas. We're going to send up a trial balloon through Lippman. The Jupiter missiles.What's that?I don't want to listen to this again.It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution.You want to turn up the heat? You call Adlai. Tell him to stick it to Zorin.Let's hope it doesn't come to that.Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.Keep us posted, Bob.So they'll remove the missiles, and we'll pledge not to invade Cuba, destabilize Castro or assist anyone who plans in doing so...Well, it seems the question of the day is -- is the offer legitimate?If it is... if it is, then we can't afford to ignore it. John, we'll have instructions for you in a couple of hours.Kenny, get over to your old stomping grounds. Go through everything the FBI has on Fomin. I need your best call: is this guy legit and is he speaking for Khruschev? And I need you to tell me by the time I call you, because right after I call you, I'm calling Scali with his instructions.I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?You're sure...Okay, Ken. We're going.Glad to hear we're not alone.Well, gentlemen, I wasn't planning on invading Cuba anyway. I think we can live with the terms of this deal.Ted, I want you to draft our acceptance.Dean?You know, the problem we have is that this is latest offer of theirs will seem reasonable to everyone. We remove our missiles, they remove theirs. Our Jupiters were scheduled for removal anyway. They're obsolete, after all.So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?Then we have no choice. General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.Permission granted.Gentlemen, if anybody's got any great ideas, now's the time...Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets?Goddammitt. There's always some sonofabitch who doesn't get the word. All we need is the Soviets thinking we're bombing them. Anybody else?No. I want confirmation there wasn't some sort of accident first.Very well, then.That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.Bobby. You know Dobrynin best.Ted, you get working on the draft.And make sure he knows we have to have an answer tomorrow. Because on Monday we begin military action against Cuba.We were just debating who had it worse, us or George Washington and his guys.Yeah, but the country didn't even exist as a country yet. It was a mess, and he didn't have a leg to stand on.Doesn't matter to me. If I went down in history like Adams, I'd die happy. All they say about him today is --You know, we never did control it. Not really. Not like we think.But we did our best. Now it's up to them.Hey! Hey. Okay, that's enough.I don't want any gloating. This is not a victory over the Soviets. It's a victory with the Soviets. I want everyone to remember that.Kenny......never mind.

{"raw_line": "Where the hell are you?Jesus Christ, guys. What the hell's Khruschev thinking?Complete snowjob. And then we went out and told the country they weren't putting missiles into Cuba. By the way, you realize we just lost the midterms.You mean there's something more important than votes? Didn't think I'd live to see the day, Ken.How long until they're operational?They lied to us. Two weeks ago Dobrynin told me to my face Khurschev had no intention of putting missiles into Cuba. They said themselves, this is our backyard.It will be Munich all over again.Damned if we do, but if we don't, we're in a war for sure somewhere else in six months.He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.... I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.We got a bunch of smart guys. We lock 'em up together in there, kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options.I'll do it.It'll be the principals, a couple of the key guys from each department: the Executive Committee of the National Security Council. We'll call it EXCOM.I think we should bring in Dean Acheson. He was fighting Soviets while we were still working the wards in Boston.Screw secrecy. You try having that fat ass sit on your lap all the way from Foggy Bottom.Everybody agrees the diplomatic route is out. It's too slow, and they'll have the missiles finished.Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.No. No. No. There is more than one option here. If one isn't occurring to us, it's because we haven't thought hard enough.You're talking about a sneak attack! How'll that make us look? Big country blasting a little one into the stone age. We'll be real favorites around the world.I can't let my brother go down in History like a villain, like a Tojo, ordering another Pearl Harbor.Bob. If we go ahead with these air strikes... There's got to be something else. Give it to me. I don't care how crazy, inadequate or stupid it sounds. Give it to me.There's still no sign they know that we know about the missiles. Been a lot of cloud cover; probably think we aren't getting any good product.What happened?We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.What if I can't?Then you'll call, right?Bring him back.We believe that a surprise attack would be counter to what the United States stands for. We believe that an attack leaves us no room for maneuver, and the inevitable Soviet response will force us into a war we do not want. A war that, this time, will really end all war.Goddman Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.He wants to talk to LeMay again.We're getting the Soviet response.Admiral Anderson, if the ships do not stop, what exactly are our rules of engagement?What happens if the ship doesn't stop for inspection or want to be towed?And what happens if the ship ignores the warning shot?Course that's for morale. The missiles only take five minutes to get here.It's an accident. They must not have gotten their orders yet. Let 'em go.What happened to speak when spoken to?We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.LeMay... he's history.Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.McNamara won't be able to handle them. It's too much for one man... ...with all due respect to our heroic fifth column.Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.Zorin will eat him alive!What's gotten into you?Oh, still sore about this.My father --He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.I make the call, and Adlai is out. McCloy goes in.John? It's Bobby. Get ready to send your staffer in. He's going to be coming out.John, I'll get back to you.I think... this may be our first real message from Khruschev.By the way, Scali, your activities now fall under the secrecy codicils of the National Security Act. Sorry, no Pulitzer.Where've you been? We've been trying to find you all morning.We just got a second letter from Khruschev. The deal's off.We're getting everyone together as fast as we can.They want us to take our missiles out of Turkey along with the no invasion pledge. It looks like Fomin was a ploy after all, and they were just stalling for time.It gets worse.Kenny! We need to talk.And?The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --All right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. Okay? You happy? So now what?And if there has been a coup and there is no acceptable political solution?He gets it, but he's pissed.Making the second letter and the overall picture look worse than it really is.... We accept the first letter and pretend the second doesn't exist.What do you want? A good-bye kiss?I don't know if I can do this.Take a left.We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?You know... I hate being called the brilliant one. The ruthless one. They guy who does the dirty work. The one everybody's afraid of.I hate it. I'm not smart, you know. And I'm not so ruthless.Slow down. Smell that?Just wanted to see for myself. They're burning their documents.They think we're going to war. G-d help us, Ken.Ambassador Dobrynin, we are aware that at this moment your missiles in Cuba are at the brink of operational readiness...They are a vital threat to my country. If launched, they would kill 80 million Americans.My brother, my friends, my countrymen and I cannot and will not permit those missiles to become operational. I promise you that.If the missiles do not become operational, if you remove the missiles, then there will be no war. At this moment, the President is accepting the terms of Secretary Khruschev's letter of Friday night. If the Soviet Union halts construction immediately, removes the missiles, and submits to U.N. inspection, the United States will pledge to never invade Cuba or aid others in that enterprise.The United States cannot agree to such terms under threat. Any belief to the contrary -- -- was in error.However, while there can be no quid pro quo on this issue, the United States can offer a private assurance.Our Jupiter missiles in Turkey are obsolete, and have been scheduled for withdrawal for some time. This withdrawal should be completed within, say, six months.Of course, any public disclosure of this assurance would negate the deal and produce the most stringent denials from our government.Yes.Of course. Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.With the caveat that it is not made public in any way, shape or form. And we must have an answer tomorrow at the latest. I cannot stress this point enough.Tomorrow...We're out here.He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.How does a guy get a rep like that?Kenny.
