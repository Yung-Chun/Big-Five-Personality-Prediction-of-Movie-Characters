{"Kids-Are-All-Right-The": {"JULES": {"raw_line": "Don't worry. We just started.Honey, that's disgusting. We're eating.Mine.For the business.Yes, thank you very much.I didn't look, honey.Laser, no phone calls at the table.Can I ask you something? What do you get from your relationship with Clay?Do you feel like he's the kind of person who will help you grow?Okay, honey. She got it. Let it go.I know...Because if I'm starting this business I need something to haul my equipment in.What does that mean?Well you're the one who's always telling me to \"act as if!\"A movie-movie?Don't focus on it.We left it in Hawaii.Sorry. I couldn't breathe. Jules wrangles the blankets, trying to cover her partner. The transition is awkward and Jules gets caught in the top sheet. As Nic repositions herself, she leans on the VOLUME CONTROL BUTTON and suddenly the porn is blasting at full volume.No, they didn't.Where are you going? It's your turn.Hey bug, come here. We're watching \"Locked Up Abroad: Uganda.\"Can I have a hug before you go?Just a quick one. Please!What? \"Are you and Clay fucking?\"And what if he is \"exploring?\" This is the age for that. Why should we care?Look, we don't even know what the deal is. We're jumping to conclusions.What are you trying to say?It feels like there's some subtext here.I don't know: Like mother like son? Is that it? Both of us aimless, wandering in the darkness, \"wasting our potential?\" Nic won't go there.Well, maybe it hasn't risen to the plane of consciousness for you yet.Laser, you left your bike out...Laser, is there anything you want to talk about?We won't judge you. Laser looks at his moms. Nic and Jules brace themselves.Honey...Honey, that's not what he asked--Well, sweetie, human sexuality is complicated. And sometimes, people's desires can be...counter- intuitive... For instance, since women's sexual responsiveness is mostly internal, sometimes it's exciting for us to see sexual responsiveness more, you know... ...externalized. Laser looks at them, still baffled.Like with a penis.You would think that. But in most of those movies, they've hired two straight women to pretend and the inauthenticity is just unbeara--Are you having a relationship with someone?Did he find you on-line?!Why was Joni there?!Look, guys, we understand why you'd be curious about your biological father. That's totally natural.Honey... We just wish you'd have included us in your thinking. But what's done is done. You met him, and now you guys can move on--Of course I know. I don't want to time-share our kids with someone. Especially when it's Joni's last summer home. No way.I know...I'm with you, honey. We're gonna get through this, okay?I love you too, pony.I hope the traffic wasn't too bad.Almost ten years. Wait, has it been that long? We moved right after Laser broke his leg, I remember that because we had a ramp for a while, so that would have been...ten, no, nine? No, ten years this fall.You okay?Go easy on the wine, hon. It's day time.I hope the food's okay. Joni told us you own a restaurant.My tongue went numb.Laser, that's not nice.I don't know. I just lost all the feeling in my face and tongue and I thought I might gag and then, you know...Yeah...exactly...Actually, she started teasing me and that really helped.I know. And it worked. You were really funny.So that's it. My tongue started working again.We like it.Well, I, you know, I studied architecture in college...But I'm not an architect. I mean I was on my way to becoming one. But I quit before the kids were born.When they got a little older, I started a Balinese furniture import business...Yeah. But that didn't work out.Actually, I'm in the process of starting a new business.Landscape design... But not like a gardener! I mean, yes, there's a gardening component to it, but the real work is to create unique, eco-friendly outdoor spaces that harmonize with the surrounding environment. Do you know what I mean?Honey, that's your forth glass.Oh, that's okay.Thank you. That's really sweet. Why don't you think about it.No! I am! I'm up for it!... Jules smiles at Nic: \"Isn't this great? My first client.\" Nic looks less than pleased.You're unbelievable. You're all over me about getting clients, I finally get one and you're--Yes, and I think it's disgusting. The two separate, go down separate isles. When they rejoin, Nic is contrite.Yeah, he was working the whole \"alternative\" thing pretty hard....We could do a kind of a Secret Garden thing with trellises and topiary... ...or something more Asian, minimal, with a rock garden feel. It's up to you...Personally, I'm tired of minimal. I'm into more is more. Let's not try to tame the space. I think it would look great all lush and overgrown and fecund...I'm sorry, you know, fertile...Sorry, I just keep seeing my kids in your expressions...You and Laser have the same mouth.Yeah. The observation strikes Paul. Suddenly, he's feeling a kind of fast-tracked intimacy with Jules he hadn't expected.Pretty close. Laser cranks a forehand that whizzes past Jules.Great. We settled on a concept.It's hard to explain. You have to kind of see the space to get it.Wow. What's this?Yeah, well...Oh god, chicken, that's the spot.Perfect. You wanna come in?No, don't stop...Nic?!!Look, I'm gonna go to the nursery in the morning so we should probably make sure you're signed off on the Bougainvillea...What's that?Oh my god. That is criminal.No, please, just take it away...I have another you may as well just tape it to my ass cause that's where it'll end up.So...you're good with the plants? Look, we don't have to do that. We could do go in a totally different direction if you--Sorry. Sometimes I mistake silence for criticism.No, I know...I just... Sometimes Nic can be a little critical, you know. She's a perfectionist.What's up?Yeah. Okay.Yes! Same time!Okay. I'm gonna take off too...That's mean.No!Okay! God, you're such a pusher! Jules grabs the pie and gives him a kiss on the mouth, almost as a mistake. Before they know it, they're making out.Whoa. I'm sorry. That was...I don't know where that came from...Okay. I'm gonna go now......but I shall return! Jules bolts for the door, clutching her pie. Paul watches her go, stunned by what just happened.What do you mean?No, we just talked...conceptually.You know, maybe we should lay off the Paul digs a little.And I also think we should start composting.Relax. She'll get home when she gets home.What's going on?Paul?Look, I'm sorry about last night. I'm really embarrassed.I know, she's just going through a lot of stuff right now...And look, I just want you to know, about the other day, the kiss, that's not something I...do.I just wanted to clear the air.Paul, I can't!No, I do! It's just... I have a guy outside!Oh. Well. Hel-lo!Nothing. Paul flips her on her hands and knees and they go at it some more.You gotta be fucking kidding me! She dislodges from Paul and starts dressing furiously.What's up?The stones? Over by the fence.What? I was using the bathroom. Do you need to use the bathroom?Joni brought some home from Paul's garden the other day. They were huge!No, but they're pushing them like crack at Whole Foods.Honey...How about some green tea, honey... Nic slams her glass on the table. Explodes.Yeah, if you drink a thousand bottles a day!I'm sorry.What the hell is going on with you?No. He's not!Maybe you need to take some time off and recharge.Because that's the way you like it! That's the way you keep control!Oh come on! You hated it when I worked! You wanted me at home, taking care of the kids. You wanted a wife!You didn't trust any of those nannies! And you sure as hell didn't back my career!Yeah, so you can feel better about yourself!Are you even attracted to me anymore?God, I feel so drugular right now. I really want a cigarette! Do you have any? I haven't had a cigarette since Laser was born. Do you smoke?Yeah. Wait, no. Don't. Sorry.Do you think I'm just like some sad- sack middle-aged lesbian?You want to get that?Did you go to Home Depot?That was fast!What's that look?The look you're giving me right now!Look, I'm not gonna play this game with you! You need to keep your judgements to yourself!I don't ask you why you keep blowing your nose constantly! I mean, if you have a drug problem that's your business...Then why are you a gardener?!Look, this isn't gonna work. I'll pay you through the end of the day and then we're done.Okay...We can't be doing this...I'm married...Yeah, and I love Nic.Jesus, what's wrong with me? I shouldn't have fired Luis like that. That was totally wrong...That wasn't messy. That was fucked up. I'm totally fucked up...Paul, don't...I'm gonna do some planting over there so it won't look so bare...Oh, I had to fire him.Yeah, he had a drug problem.Blow, I think...Mmm-hmmm.Well, you and Paul seemed to get on like gang-busters...What?Where is this coming from?!What? I was working. I got dirty so I took a shower.No!No. It has nothing to do with that!I've just felt so cut off from you lately...No! Who said anything about fault? Just listen to me!I just needed...No, appreciated!He's not just \"other people!\"Where are you going?!Hey Laser. Honey?Listen, I know you and Joni heard what's going on. I just want you to know that what happened with Paul and me is over. There's nothing going on now.I know you might need some time to process your feelings around this, but I just want you to know that I'm here for you if you want to talk about anything. Is there anything you want to talk about?Okay then. Go back to sleep.Joni?Can we just--Okay. I'm sorry.Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I should have called you. Jules sucks a big, anxious drag off a cigarette.Nic saw my hair in your bathroom.Yeah.Yeah. Beat.Paul...Paul, come on...Jesus, Paul! I'm gay!Just getting another pillow. The couch is kind of saggy.It's a little ache-y.Hey. How was the party?How big was it?Are you drunk?Don't talk to your mom like that! Joni spins to face Jules.Hey, I'm still your mother.I can't believe this is our last dinner together.I wish you were gay. You'd be so much more sensitive.I need to say something.Look, it's no big secret your mom and are in hell right now. Bottom line...marriage is hard...really fucking hard. Just two people, slogging through the shit, year after year, getting older, changing. It's a fucking marathon, okay?! Everyone is silenced by the outpouring. Jules soldiers on.So sometimes you're together so long, you just stop seeing the other person. You just see weird projections of your own junk. And instead of talking to each other, you go off the rails, and act grubby and make stupid choices. Which is what I did. And I feel sick about it because I love you guys and I love your mom and that's the truth. Sometimes you hurt the ones you love the most. I don't know why. Maybe if I read more Russian novels I would...Anyway, I just wanted to say how sorry I am about what I did and that I hope you'll forgive me eventually.

"PAUL": {"raw_line": "How you doing, foxy?Oh, sorry...What can I say. I've just been out there, you know...hoe-ing. How's it looking tonight? They stand close to each other, peering at the chart.Really...Hello.It is. Who's this?Okay. What can I do for you?Yeah...I did a little bit of that back then...Uh-huh. Paul heads to the back of the kitchen, searching for privacy.Not really. I mean I was 19 when I did it. It was so long ago...I just figured no one actually used my stuff.This is so weird. I mean, a part of me's really curious...I don't know.Hi, I'm looking for Joni Allgood.Hi. This is Paul... Uh, your donor...?Is this a good time to talk?So... How are you?I'm well, thanks. Banal, awkward pause. Paul jumps in to fill the void.So, Wendy at the Cryobank said you call-- Joni cuts in, nervous and businesslike.Your brother?No. I didn't know.Both of them?Like in two?Good deal. I love lesbians. Paul cringes at his lameness. Joni doesn't know what to say.Joni. Hey. Nice to meet you.And Laser, right?Very cool name.Thanks for making the trek all the way over here. No one knows what comes next.Cool, I got a table set up for us out here...Listen, feel free and ask me anything you want, okay? Or we can just hang out. That's fine too. Whatever you guys want.Anything you want to ask me, Laser?That's fine. I'd love to know about you guys. What about you, Joni? What are you up to?Oh yeah? Congratulations.Shut the front door!Don't stress it, Laze. School wasn't my thing either and I turned out okay.I'm sorry. Laser. So tell me about you, Laser. What are you into? Laser freezes. So his sister jumps in.Oh yeah?I played a little basketball in junior high.Pretty much. The whole \"team\" thing got on my nerves, you know like, \"Hey, let's go kick some ass, man!\" What about you?Hey, I wasn't bagging teams in general. Teams are great. I'm just weird like that.Yeah, I've been working on it for a while. I also have this organic co- op farm down the road. We use a lot of the stuff we grow there for the restaurant.No. No pigs... But it's a great spot. You guys should come check it out sometime.Yeah. You like motorcycles?That's too bad. They're fun.Well it was great to meet you guys.I hope this was okay.Really nice to meet you, Laser.Sweet. They were really good kids. The boy's kind of a sensitive jock and the girl's kind of innocent but whip-smart and super cute.Yeah, we kinda did.We didn't really leave it anywhere. Brooke, the sexy Wiccan volunteer, comes up to Paul bearing a basket of freshly-picked fruits.Whatcha got? Oh cool. First strawberries of the season.Whoa...Hi, great to meet you two.No, I've got my bike so...I just sort of weave through.This is for you. I don't know if you guys like wine... Nic takes it.Beautiful house. How long you guys lived here?Okay.The food's great. Can't go wrong with salmon and corn. Nic finishes a glass of wine as Jules takes note.Well, I always liked food.Oh yeah. Wow, that was a long time ago. Yeah, I was considering it, but then I dropped out of school.Yeah, it wasn't my thing.It just seemed like a massive waste of money after a while. I mean, I wasn't \"doing\" anything. I was just sitting on my ass listening to people spout off ideas I could've just as easily learned reading a book. Paul sees that his little rant may be alienating the moms.I'm not saying higher learning uniformly sucks. I mean, college is great for some people.Joni, I'm sure you're gonna love it. That's just me. I'm just weird that way. Which is probably why I ended up in the food-services industry.My social life?No, never been married or divorced. I date a little, but I'm just kind of focused on my work right now.So, how'd you guys meet?Really?What happened to your tongue?Choke? Die?...So what'd you do for her?That's a great story.So Nic, I know you're a doctor. How `bout you, Jules? What do you do? Jules never likes this question.Right...Well, that happens...Right on.Well, business aren't easy--Good for you. What kind?Absolutely.No, she didn't.Hey, I was just thinking. You know, I bought this place last year and the backyard's a wreck. Would you be interested in working on it?No, seriously. I don't have time to work on it myself.Why? I just did. I mean, if you're not up for it that's okay--What do you think?Fecund?No, I love that word. You just don't hear it that often. More is more. Yeah. Let's do that.What?You think so?This may not be a good idea.He's not gonna make it. Clay, you're not gonna make it!Maybe next time we can hang out just you and me.That's not amped. That's being a dick.Okay...I just didn't like the way he was talking to you.You're right...I don't...Sure.Well, it's a lot more fun then donating blood. Laser doesn't laugh. Paul realizes he's gonna have to give a \"non-joke\" answer.I don't know, I guess I thought, you know, if I can help somebody in need, somebody who wants a baby...It was a long time ago...Why do you want to know?I don't know, like 60 bucks a pop.It was worth more back then. You know. With inflation... Hey, I'm glad I did it...Strawberry rhubarb pie. Fresh from my garden.Good, huh?Have more.You had one bite.Hey now, don't go negative on your ass.No, I'm just thinking. Hang on. Yeah, I'm good with the plants.I wasn't criticizing you.That doesn't mean you have to be negative.Same time tomorrow? Jules pushes Paul, laughing.Here, take this...Just give it to the kids.It's okay...Jules...?You got your mom's fair skin. You didn't get my Mediterranean genes...Who's that?Why? What's she doing?She's your mom. That's her job.Well, if you want things to be different, you've got to make that happen. That's your job.Here, put this on. Joni takes the helmet and puts it on. Paul fastens the buckle for her. They get on the bike and take off down the hill.I'm a very safe rider...You know, Nic. If you eased up on the restrictions, maybe there'd be less tension...I was just saying--I was just making an observation.Hey. What's up?Don't be. She's the one who wigged out.Jules, it's okay. You don't have to defend her.Yeah, I sensed that.The air is clear.You don't want to?!What?I know.Hey, don't take it easy on me cause you're winning--Nobody likes a show-off.Oh god. Okay. Hit me.That's your question?I think I'd rather be buried.I don't know, something about the idea of being burned into this chalky powder and sprinkled--That's true. I guess I just want to be in a place where people can visit me.Sorry guys, I need to steal Tanya back now. Sasha clocks Paul's hand. She carefully and without looking back places her hand on top of his.Sometimes. But I don't have any here. Want me to run to the store?God, that's it. I was trying to figure out how to describe you to my friends. Thank you.No. I want to get this...Hey, Joni. I'm here...Listen, don't worry about your friend. Jules pales. She mouths: \"What are you doing?!\" Paul gesticulates: \"I'm sorry!\"No. Honestly. I didn't even notice...Hey, Joni? Can you hold on a second?How's it going?Here, let me help.I know......and the kids...I know... They stare at each other and we cut to...I got you some cigarettes.Come on. Don't be so hard on yourself. Things get messy sometimes...I think I'm really falling for you.Wow. Yeah. Good night.I think she looks more like her mom actually. But thank you.Yeah?Oh yeah?...Yeah, it's been a while.Tanya, you're so sexy and beautiful, but I don't think we should do that anymore.You know, our thing is really fun and easy, but...I don't want to be 50 and still \"hanging out.\" You know? If I really want a family then I have to stop getting in these situations that don't go anywhere. Paul just looks at her. Tanya gets it.Hey Nic, I think you're gonna love this `98 Screaming Eagle.I just mist it with a little truffle oil.So it's not too rare?Good. A lot of people in the restaurant order a steak rare and they freak out at the slightest sight of red.Don't people know that rare means red?Exactly! They should see what rare looks like in Argentina. The cow's practically still mooing. Laser chuckles at Paul's joke, then reigns it in. Joni tries to insert herself in the conversation.Thanks...Oh yeah, you a Joni Mitchell fan?Cool. Right on...I think I have to go with \"Blue.\" Nic raises her hand in a testify.Yeah? You too?I know, it never lets up, you got \"River,\" \"California...\"\"All I Want..\"Hey. It's hard enough to open your heart in this world. Don't make it harder.You didn't tell me you were named after Joni M.I think it's cool.Just around there.Hey Joni, how you doing?Excuse me?What happened?Listen, can I just come and talk with you--Joni...Hey, it's me. I just talked to Joni. Conversation intercut.What happened?The other night.Fuck...Listen, it's all out in the open now. Let's make this happen.No, I'm serious. Fuck it. Let's get the kids together and do this thing.No! I'm sick of this life. I want a family. I'm ready--I needed to talk to you before you left.I just want to apologize again for what happened. I can't tell you how much I regret it.No, it wasn't bullshit at all. I know I don't seem credible right now but I really care about you... Paul struggles to keep his emotions in check....and I just hope someday we'll be able to see each other again. Do you think that could maybe happen?What?Nic, hold on...Well, they're kinda my...I didn't mean to hurt anyone...
