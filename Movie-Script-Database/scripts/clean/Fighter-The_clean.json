I can't lose again. Look at that guy.He did not just get off his fuckin' couch.Where?You'll pay me to train in Vegas?What about my brothah?(looking out window,No, he didn't mention you.Yeah I know.

He gets up off the couch and peeks through the shade.. .AND SEES CHARLENE STANDING ON HIS DOORSTEP. Scared, he ducks back down, crouches behind a chair. KNOCKING continues.I was gonna call, I started to call, but I couldn't call.How'd you know my house anyway?I didn't get to fight the Jewish black guy.He got the flu, the guy who took his place had 16 pounds on me, I nevah shoulda fought him.Nobody woulda got paid.

That's good, Dick, I'm just, ya know, trying to figure out what's best for me-- Micky tilts his head, cat's got his tongue. They all look at him. Alice lights a cigarette, exhales, tense.Yeah, I know, Ma.

He hangs up. He and Charlene stare at each other, taking it in, emotional, awkward. She laughs a little through tears. - .they hug. Micky crying into her shoulder and hair, Charlene holding onto him, she backs him into his BEDROOM, the fall to the bed, kissing. FADE OUT -I wanna meet that guy George told you about. [pause] The one with the cab company. Charlene nods, Micky disappears down the stairs; she runs to the edge of the balcony, looks down, waits, in a moment Micky's back appears from under the porch, walking away. She watches him go.You own a cab company, you're a good businessman, right?Don't answah the door.I'm not hidin' from nobody -Why ya always lookin' out for him, Ma? Wes? Why's it always Dicky, Dicky, Dicky -Yeah, a funny way, Ma, Dicky's a great trainah, I love him to death, but do ya evah think all the othah damage he's done?Don't ever lay a hand on Charlene.HEY!

They let ya keep the new teeth!You look good, your eyes are clear.That's beautiful, Dick. There's somethin' we gotta talk about.I made a promise to them that I wouldn't work with you again.

Dicky is hurt, stunned.I'm glad you're back, I'm glad you're doing good, I don't know what else to say.I wouldn'ta won Sanchez without Dicky.Because it's true. I went in with our plan and it wasn't working, I switched to what I learned with Dicky. Micky looks at O'Keefe, who is hurt.I wouldn'ta won it without you, either, O'Keefe, you know that.I'm the one fighting, not you, not you, and not YOU. I know what I need.I want Dicky back. And I want you, Charlene, and I want O'Keefe, and my family.You sound like them now.Can this be my fight, for once, Alice, huh, just once, maybe just this one time, not for Dicky? I know you think he's comin' back, he's 40 years old and doesn't have a tooth in his head that's his own--Shut up!Shut up! Dicky, hurt, stops.Good. Get O'Keefe back, too.You went ten rounds, and he never hurt you. You were my hero.Do you want a ride home?HEY. Nobody goes on stage. Just me and the manager, that's how it's done by the professionals. I don't wanna hear anothah word.

Look at this -- He walks down the street like he's running for office, people shouting his out his name. . .most everyone knows him...and even those who don't are charmed by this toothless Pied Piper... some look confused, surprised by his comeback, some hold memorabilia from his Sugar Ray Leonard fight to sign. He kisses a girl, laughs his missing-toothed grin. Dicky high- fives 19-year-old RAY RAMALHO, crew cut, body bent by cerebral palsy.Ray Ray! Smile, you're gonna be in my movie!

Dicky inhales again from pipe, a refashioned plastic soda bottle, lit with a Bic lighter. He starts sparring BooBoo. SINGLE ON Dicky OVER BOOBOO'S SHOULDER, actual audio in his head from the fight: \"Ecklund has a bit of a reputation for being a fast-liver, Don.\" \"A what?\" \"A fast-liver. And they think, at least Angelo said he thought that's what has held him back. But of course with an opportunity like this perhaps he's slowed down his living a little bit.\"BooBoo put ya hands up, stand like Sugah Ray I gotta get ready for my movie!I stahted the ovahhand right in the 8th.

I think we got all the bases covahed, right? Micky lost three fights in a row, he can't get used to losin', it becomes a mental thing, we're gonna break it with Mamby, right?Enough a you wastin' time, Mick, half the fuckin' day's gone, we got work to do! Micky glares at Dicky like he's going to fucking hit him.Oooh, Alice, he's mad now, look at him. Ya hit one those guys like ya wanna hit me right now maybe ya woulda won one of them fights! See? He's a quiet guy, he needs the fire.Work, work, head, body, head, body. [To camera] Set it up sneaky, switches stances inside. No! [shoves Micky] That's too far out, switch inside, see, he switches outside, I'm gonna catch him like this, [upper cuts Micky, nails him], don't switch OUTSIDE! Micky, mad, throws a fast combination back but Dicky leans on the ropes and SLIPS IT ALL, clinches Micky, smiles at camera, pops his hips forward.Micky does everythin' I tell him, he's goin' all the way to a world title! Now move, that's why you dropped the weight! We're gonna out box Mamby. [Now to Producer] Three months. I can get myself back in shape in three months.Hook-- Head-Body-Head! C'mon! That's ya fuckin' combo, head-body- head!Ya know Sugah Ray's gonna be there callin' the fight for ESPN. I ain't seen him since since I knocked 'im down 14 yeahs ago. You don't wanna embarrass yaself in front a Sugah Ray, do ya Mick?! Micky scowls at them, gets inside, unloads a vicious hook to Gilberto's ribs. Jose crumples down to the canvas. .Micky's eyes go wide as he looks down at Jose on the ground. Micky's surprised himself, that was good!That's ya punch, Micky.That's a kidney punch, shuts the whole body down. Right heah - [pokes HBO producer on the spot and he bends over in pain, Dicky laughs].You look good! You can definitely do this. You look good in there, Micky, real good. [false teeth sideways, crazy face]. I'm Saoul Mamby, Micky Ward hit me - Dicky arm around Micky, walks up to Alice at her car, Little Alice and Beaver getting inside. He shoves his dentures coo- coo sideways --I'm not here! Bonnie laughs as Dicky rushes for an open window in the back of the kitchen, 2nd floor of the crack house. Dicky climbs out the window and jumps...No, no, I just came to check on some friends, I'm not mixed up in this. Micky looks at his mother in disbelief, his father down on the ground behind him... . his brother high out of his mind.Hold on. BOO BOO STARTS TO CLIMB IN, 'COSMO' written on forehead.We got a promotional thing we're doin', for the bar, it's gonna be good, you'll see.Nobody asked you!See his right ahm goes leaves his side open, light him up like a pinball machine, he'll be pissin' blood, no way you lose, no way - .Alice and LOU GOLD, 40s, balding, mustache, the matchmaker for ESPN, walk into the room, \"Mamby vs Meekins\" still playing on TV. Alice looks serious.ESPN couldn't get us bettah rooms than this, Lou?Like what?The guy from Philly, ain't he in prison?He's a fuckin' middleweight, Ron!We're gonna box Mamby, not slug it out with a middleweight!Joey Ferrell knocked him out! You knocked out Joey Ferrell.Ray! Sugah Ray! Ovah heah! Sugar Ray doesn't respond to Dicky. He's talking to the ESPN camera, still looks young, handsome, not a mark on him.We gotta talk latah!Holy shit. [rubs Micky's neck]Look at me, Mick, don't look away.You can't go back to fightin' scared, you gotta hit back like you know you can and I know you can. I don't care who that guy is, you're Micky Ward. Micky nods, but we see he's scared; it's not a fair fight.- Button it up, Ed. If you can't stop the bleedin', we'll fuckin' sue ya. .Ed Aliano smiles, sticks swabs up Micky's nose to stop the bleeding, get everything cleaned out. . .Dicky pours water into Micky's mouth. Micky swishes it around, spits it out...You okay?What're you doin' out there? You feel like fightin' or what? You gotta jab and move. Don't stand in front of this guy, keep 'im off ya, jab and move - Jab and move. What are you ascared of? You're fightin' scared again! Micky just nods.We nevah shoulda fought that guy. Forget about it. Alice, HBO's waitin' for us. Sugah Ray's out there! C'mon you come too, Mick. Dicky heads back out. Alice looks at Micky, pats his cheek and follows after Dicky, leaving Micky sitting alone on the trainer's table.RAAAAAAAY! Hey, Ray,-- The bodyguard stops him. Sugar Ray sees Dicky and waves him over.. .Dicky smiles, missing teeth. The HBO cameraman following after him. Sugar Ray shakes Dicky's hand.That's what I was tellin' 'im! I told 'im, Ray. But Mungin weighs like 160 pounds! ESPN fucked us,-- Ya know I knocked Ray down.Oh don't say that now. I know I look like shit, but,-- I went 10 rounds with you, Ray, I knocked you down. C'mon, lemme buy you guys a drink.(points to the HBO(looks at Sugar Ray like he's fucking crazy; whatWhat's he talkin' to Mike Toma for? He starts to head over.You can't trust that guy, Micky, you don't know 'im. Did he say anythin' about me? Did he say I could come?Take care, Mick, we'll talk tommorrah. Little Dicky runs out of the house into Dicky's arms.Hey, champ! Daddy's home!Not this time, Dicky, try and gimme a sock in the nose-- Micky, lost in thought, stands at his car watching Dicky playing with Little Dicky.What're you talkin' about? George walks over to his Micky sympathetically as Dicky grabs his brother by the shoulders.ESPN screwed us, they owe us. We'll get anothah fight. Just get healed up, Micky, you're okay -Just like I told ya! Against Joey Belinc in six weeks at Foxwoods! Kid's like 10-8. He's nuthin'. And they're payin' us 25 grand!17.5, I thought you said 25, anyway that's still good money, Mick.What!? Charlene looks at Micky, as if to say, \"speak. is He looks at her, she starts to open her mouth, stops.Why, how they been goin'? You're the one in the ring, Micky, yeah that last one was unfair, but we ain't gonna repeat that, so it's up to you in the ring.What's his problem? Micky sits back and folds his arms, a bit frustrated.What do you know about anythin'! We don't even know who you ah.He don't know who she is!And me.Of course! Of course, Micky, I coulda had that! I know what you're talkin' about. You think I'm stupid?Ma, please, let me say this-- to give YOU $200 each, and now you have your $2,000.Understand?Not everyone, just 10 a you.No no no no. I'm givin' you anYou get that from TEN OTHAH PEOPLE you offah the opportunity to.I love Cambodian people! They all yell in Cambodian at Dicky who looks aggravated, still holding onto Quackah.They didn't understand. They're practically my gang, they usually listen to me but didn't understand the opportunity, anyway, where wereOh, yeah, all the money I coulda made if we just fuckin' did it RIGHT, they threw me in too early. We didn't know, my mothah didn't know, Sugar Ray was too much, too soon. I needed to build slow. If I had Micky's discipline, with my talent, forget about it. My wife Debbie was the prettiest girl in Lowell, and my daughtah Kasie, I mean Kerry, I want Kerry to be proud a me. [Lights pipe]Excuse me, BooBoo, it's still my movie, and this part [lights pipe] will make me and Micky's comeback more dramatic. I'll tell ya how crack works [inhales from pipe].When it entahs ya blood, ya get a peaceful energetic feeling ovah ya body, a kinda happiness - As his words continue we PUSH IN ON Dicky'S FACE and CUT TO FLASHBACK: medium shot, Dicky sits by a window, high; from this dissolves a second Dicky who dances a slow happy, funk dance across the room; out of this second Dicky dissolves a third Dicky who lies on the couch, Karen comes and makes out with him ---all the mistakes and the regrets of the past melt away, you feel so much lightah like when you were young and everything's in front of you. Then it fades and you gotta get high again. All three Dickys in the flashback - by the window, dancing, making out on couch -- flicker and vanish to the grating sound of aphone left off the hook. PULL OUT FROM Dicky's face in present(through cheap megaphoneEmpty ya pockets, put everything on the roof, ID, wallet, cash. Your wife know you're here, huh?Don't turn around! Empty ya pockets! The guy empties his pockets onto the roof of the Volvo. BooBoo sits in Dicky's station wagon.Walk to the sidewalk, we have to take the vehicle. [Takes cash, mumbles to Karen] Take half, get us some rocks.You're 'bout to lose your breath.We gotta talk, it was self-defense, right, say it was self defense, ya come outside, ya seen 'em beatin' on me, I didn't do nuthin' --I was doin' it for you!What ah ya gonna do without me? Micky stares as Officer pulls Dicky away, sad.- I can't believe they let Micky go. What about me?What'd I do? They're aftah me. I'm fuckin' Dicky Ecklund. I'm gonna have to plead out, right, get like three yeahs. Could HBO help talk to 'em? What's gonna happen to my movie? I'll be out in a yeah or so, maybe less with good behaviah. We can finish it then,What about my comeback? I didn't do nuthin'. Who's gonna take care a Little Dicky and, what about Tommy?I know. They're lettin' everybody on the first two tiers watch it tonight. C'mon, hit daddy with a kunckle sandwich. Bang-bang. Right in the mouth. C'mon, a knuckle sandwich! .Little Dicky hits Dicky in the mouth again. . .And Dicky pops out his fake teeth. Little Dicky cracks up laughing.- My teef, my teef, Dicky, you knocked out my teef!It wasn't supposed to work out this way. Say we did it for the kids, ma.About drugs, and all that. Is Micky gonna watch it? You ask 'im why he don't come to see me? All I do in here is think about comin' back and workin' with Micky, that's what keeps me goin'. I want a second chance to do it right for him and win a title. Will ya tell him that for me? They hear a guard, \"C'mon, five minutes Dicky, wrap it up.\" Little Dicky reaches out and gently cups his father's nose..I gotta go home, Harry. I gotta tell Dicky it's gonna be okay, he don't gotta cry.- He don't gotta cry no more.Yeah, sure, they got ya fighin' Alfonso Sanchez.Yeah, HBO's all invested in the Mexican, Micky, wake up, they don't care if you get killed. Toma did it. He's usin' ya like a steppin'- stone for Sanchez.I seen that Mexican fight, Micky! He hits very hard! 15 knockouts! Undefeated! Are you crazy? That idiot LoNano went right for it! He's usin' you to steal money!What's ya plan, Mick? How ya gonna fight Sanchez?Oh yeah, you are.They won't let us watch the fight cuz it's 'violent'! They let us watch the stupid documentary on crack but not my own brothah fightin'! [people look at them]. Are ya scared? Are ya embarraassed cuz ya don't even have a plan? Just tell me.I won't shit on it. Come on, just tell me.Ya gotta run against this guy! Move, let 'im punch himself outTake 'im to the body, Micky! Get inside. Switch stances like ya workin' his right, hit 'im on the left. Be careful, don't switch outside.I'm TALKIN' about the way you fight, you moron! You know I'm right! As Micky opens the door his face registers Dicky's words.I told 'im inside, c'mon, Micky!He's gotta go inside, Ma, he's gotta go inside when the time's right. He's gotta -Easy, Ma, my back's killin' me.I'll make it right with Micky, I'll apologize, it'll all be okay.Quackah! .Micky stops punching, smiles when he sees his brother, sweat dripping... and jumps out of the ring, leaving Mickey O'Keefe behind holding the pads... Charlene, George, Sal, Art, Ray, other fighters in the gym look at Dicky, some call out, \"Dicky!\" \"Dickyee!\" \"Dicky!\" WHILE MICKY AND ALICE HAVE AWKWARD EYE CONTACT; ALSO CHARLENE AND ALICE, then Micky and Charlene.Hey, why ain't Micky spahhin'!? Georgie, what're you doin' outta the house? Charlene just shakes her head at Dicky. Micky kisses his mother hello.Hey. Ra Ray! O'Keefe stares, fuming, looks to Micky, who glances nervously, but says nothing.I wanna make an amend to everyone here, I know I done a lot of stupid things, and I wanna say I'm sorry, and that's ovah. They all look at him.I'm very grateful to be back in this gym with you all. I gotta lotta time to make up for, and I wanna make the best of it.You deserve the best, Micky, you have a chance to go all the way and I'm ready to be there for ya. Charlene and O'Keefe look upset. Awkward, everyone looking at Dicky who nods, pleased, and walks into the locker room. O'Keefe and Charlene stare intensely at Micky, who looks somber.I look good, right? Alice said lock up mighta been the best thing to happen to me. I got clean. I got clear up here .Hold on, I wanted to say' I been waitin' for this day, Micky, I been waitin' the whole time I was away. It kept me goin', it kept me alive, the idea of us workin' togethah again. Micky looks at him, nods. It's breaking his heart.Ever?The whole time I was away --He says I can't work with him.Don't talk to my mother my mother like that.Fuck you, Charlene, I'm 8 months sober.O'Keefe's in the same boat I am, one day at a time, why's it all right for him to be here, but not me? I'm blood.I was trainin' in jail, so I'm ready. The two brothers spar, falling right back into it as Alice, George, others watch. Dicky moving around the ring... He snaps Micky's head with a combination. Micky starts banging him with body shots...Bam! Bam! Bam!...Dicky tries to make Micky miss. Micky grabs him tying him up.. .Dicky pushes Micky away, ducks, jabs.. .Micky traps Dicky's left under his elbow/arm, pulling it. . .Turning Dicky so his back is exposed, drilling him in the kidney. Dicky goes down on one knee in pain... And Micky comes over the top with a straight right off the back of Dicky's head.. .Dicky SLAMS down hard! Face hitting canvas, blood running from his nose into his mouth...I'm Shea Neary, let's go, I'm Shea Neary, how ya gonna work me?Shea Neary --I'm the one who has this fight, this is my chance for a title, and I won't get another one after this. Am I being selfish? Am I saying Micky, Micky, Micky? I'm sorry, I thought I was fighting for a championship. He throws his gear off and starts to go when she runs to him, embraces him.No, I gotta take care a something.Do ya, Georgie?You're my poppa, George.I gotta take care a something. He takes off, leaving George behind.I know you can't fuckin' stand me.I got no use for you eithah, but my bruthah loves ya and ya can't walk away 'cause a me. He don't deserve that. If you want me to quit, I'll quit.Sweah to God, I'll quit if it makes you go back. Micky's got a chance to do somethin' I nevah did -Fuck you, Charlene. I came here to make things right -Your eyes are red, you're hung ovah, don't tell me you're not. Ya life sucks.Then leave me alone. He needs me, you heard him, and I know he needs you, so let's spare him the bullshit from either one of us. She looks at him. Nods grudgingly.We worked it out fah you. Ask her. It's all together. Micky looks up and sees Charlene standing in the door. She nods. He looks at Dicky.Micky nods, heads toward Charlene.- hey, Mick, you think I knocked down Sugah Ray Leonahd? Micky pauses, looks at his brother, says nothing.(walking away, back(shakes his head, limpsI should be the one standin' there next to him, I'm his trainah, his brothah and my mothah--No shit, Mick, she's our muthah - Reporters laugh, shout, \"How long were you their manager for, Mrs. Ward?\"Where's his song, Sal? You gotta be good for somethin'. I dunno why you gotta be in the cornah anyways -Why dontchya try singin', Sal, maybe you can do that -Good. Go right at him, staht early for once!Shut up! Get outta here!(leans close into his brother before he goes,Go aftah 'im! Get off the ropes! Micky throws a right, going right after Neary. Neary caught off-guard, steps back, letting Micky off the ropes. Micky keeps throwing, legs still unsteady. Neary flicks out a jab, keeping his distace. Foreman, \"I think Neary's making a big, big mistake. He's allowing Micky to recover. He knows Micky's a veteran who's been hurt before, knows what to do when he's hurt. But he doesn't know if he's still hurt or not.\" .Micky waking back up, getting his legs back under him, hitting Neary with a left to the body--Left uppercut ...Neary answers, landing a left hook to Micky's chin--Left hook--Left hook.Don't take unnecessary punishment, you're not a punchin' bag, don't let him abuse you! You hear me? We been waitin' our whole lives for this! It's all been leading up to right now, Micky! This is your time, Micky! I blew it, but you don't have to. Take all ya emotion and pain from me all we done and use it out there right now. Don't let 'em take it away from you, Micky! Do you hear me? Micky looks at his brother, nods, turns spits out blood and water. Dicky TAKES MICKY'S NECK IN HIS HANDS AS HE PUTS HISOhmygahd, Micky, you're the world champion! You're champion a the whole world! .Dicky holding his brother up in his arms...Micky raises his fists above his head... the two brothers together in the middle of the crowded ring...

Micky's a clown. Dicky went to the store for me.Get outta the ring, O'Keefe, Dicky's the numbah one trainah, should be that way in the movie.Don't -- he's not part of this, forget him. He's numbah two manYou need me walkin' in again? - I wasn't ready last night, but I'm ready today.That's the Golden Gloves, before that the Silvah Mittens, Micky did that too.

Dicky lied he was 18. In the ring, push in on Micky looks up, eyes wide.And Dicky was just a kid from Lowell.Dicky had never been knocked down in his professional career, neither had Sugar Ray. They were both 21- yeahs-old.( 15 years earlier, alreadyIt's true! Sugar Ray had a hard time hitting Dickie, didn't really knock him down, but Dicky knocked Ray down! I wore a new white dress.

If his goal is to frustrate Leonard, he's doing it. Leonard still hasn't solved his speed, still hasn't been able to find him, I think in his own cute way Ecklund is making Leonard be the aggressor..\"My Dicky can do anything!

What would you do without Dicky? Or the family?What?Listen to your bruthah, honey, they owe us big time. Maybe they could even do Dicky's comeback fight too. Micky just nods okay. Dicky pats him on the back as Micky gets into his car.What're you talkin' about? (to O'Keefe who's staringJesus, it used to be Dicky was the one we couldn't find, now it's both of 'em?What girl?Just find Micky and tell him we have business to discuss.

He is torn up over this as he considers it before he speaks and they all watch, tense.You were lucky to win that fight, Dicky saved him!Everything happens for a reason, this could be for the best, honey. Micky watches Dicky get geared up with gloves, headgear, mouth guard by Art Ramalho. ANOTHER BOXER gears up Micky.Alice, take him home. [Little Alice leaves with Little Dicky]. What're you doin', Micky? What's the matter with you!Let your brother talk.I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't know.I didn't know what I was doing, I don't know why I did what I did, I did the best I could, I'll do better, I don't want to hurt you, Micky, I love you so much. As she holds him, Micky looks frustrated, but tears up in spite of himself and nods.Been there from the staht --(smiles at all the cameras.. .her one well-Both my boys are champions, Micky you're a champion! I love you!

Are you gonna order a drink? Are you gonna just stand there lookin' at my ass? Your father looks at my ass but at least he talks.

You pave streets, right?I heard you're a steppin' stone.The guy -- they use -- against othah fightahs to move the othah fightahs up. Micky and Charlene stare at each other.

What kinda name is Saoul Mamby?Where'd they find a guy like that?Formah champ.What's that mean?I didn't know there was a difference.Are you married?It happens all the time, trust me.When?I saw your shadow. And I heard you talk two seconds ago! Micky doesn't move.Why don't you open the door and tell me to my face why you didn't call me yestahday? Micky thinks, goes to the door, opens it. Charlene is slightly taken aback by his bandaged face.- Why'd you stand me up last night?'Cuz you lost the fight?I asked my brothah,-- Your, ahhh, your thing is comin' off. She points to his face. He touches the right side bandage.No, the othah thing. It's a mess. It IS a mess.Ya got any tape?You didn't go head-body-head.So why'd you fight him?Who's everybody?So are you gonna take me to dinnah and movie tonight or what?Thanks.

You come to this theatah a lot?Like what?I think Belle Epic is how ya say it and I nevah heard of it. Is it only playin' up here in Lexington?From who?That's what you wanted to see? There wasn't even any sex. What Lowell guy on a road crew saw that movie in Lexington and recommended it?? Micky walks quickly ahead to the car, can't find his keys.Micky. [He stops, turns] They're in your hand. Micky looks at the keys in his hand, embarrassed.What's going on? You afraid to run into your girlfriend? You have a girlfriend, just say it, that's why you took me to Lexington. then stops, puts the car in park and turns the engine off. f nNTTNTTFT)'- What do you have to be ashamed of?You said you never shoulda fought that guy, but your mothah and your brothah wanted ya to do it.You think your family's lookin' out for ya?What else could I say after what you told me? Look at your face, look at you. Beat. He suddenly leans in and kisses her. The kiss builds with confidence and passion to a very intense level of connection and abandon and promise.Really? I heard a lot about you, too.The same thing you meant. Micky shifts uncomfortably toward the sofa.I don't know, maybe you not showin' up on time to train. Maybe Micky havin' to come find you in a crack--when you're sposed to go to the airport.My name is Charlene, you just met me, I'm datin' Micky. Should we do it again? Hi, my name is Charlene.We're together, don't insult me and don't insult Micky.Stop callin' me a MTV girl, whatever the fuck that means.Why aren't you at work? Is ESPN paying you to train?Dicky? Alice would be better than Dicky.Fuck, those pillows barely did the job, pardon my French, Kasie.She did. But she's wants to quit to go for teachah certification.It's OK, I know you been tryin' to live offa Micky for years.Whoa.Mickyyyy! Nooooo!LEAVE HIM ALONE!

Micky doesn't say anything.I don't wanna see you, Micky.I can't take it, I'm not gonna let you or your family drag me down. )That's fuckin' stupid.Because it's sad you let them take it away from you, with all their stupid bullshit.There's a lot you could do, Micky. Ya fathah's gotta guy he wants ya to meet. You just don't think you can do it without Dicky - Micky looks at the intercom... doesn't say anything... looks up at the apartment building. Walks away. 65aA INT. DICKY'S CELL - BILLRICA HOUSE OF CORRECTIONS- NIGHT 65aA Dicky shivers through crack withdrawal, clinging to his bed, sweating. SCREAMS, scratches at himself, SCREAMS in agony. PRISONER'S SHOUT OS 'SHUT THE FUCK UP.' Time lapse shows day night day night as Dicky shakes, screams, shivers. Til he stops - exhausted. Clean.No crazy-time nonsense.Holy shit. Your mothah's here with your sistahs.I'm not hidin' from your crazy fuckin' family, Micky!Hi.Look at what?He's not hiding.Micky's a grown man, he can make his own decisions.You got a funny way a showin' it --Lettin' him get beat up, get his hand broken.Don't call me skank, I'll rip that hair right outta ya fuckin' head! Red Dog lunges at Charlene and takes poke at her; Charlene grabs Red Dog's face and shoves her.. .then backhands Beaver, who's grabbing her hair, sloppy like a bar fight.Come on Micky! Stop dickin' around!(looks up at Micky fromWhy? Why is the beautiful?They have to go, Micky.How can you say that to O'Keefe?You got the focus and confidence from O'Keefe and Sal and your father and me!We saved him! Dickya junkbag!I'm sure you'll need somethin' for your back now that you're out.You can't do that to us.Maybe you're just like them and that's where you belong. She looks at him, turns and walks out of the gym, followed by O'Keefe, who looks sadly back at Micky.Get off my porch, you piece of shit. Dicky presses the buzzer and won't stop.You fuckin' asshole!Really? What makes ya say that?You're full a shit.OK, let's make things right, numbah one: Ya didn't knock down Sugah Ray Leonahd, he tripped.Maybe, the part without Micky sucks. Maybe I never did anything special like you, but I love Micky and I want him to have his chance.OK. I'll see ya in Micky's corner, otherwise go fuck yourself.

He jumps into the ring and holds the mits for Micky who hits them, they work the mits. Sisters whisper, gossip. Suddenly the door bursts open, EVERYONE LOOKS: Alice, made un, hair done, high heels, gold earrings, new dress, grand entrance with Dicky's scrapbooks under her arm...Two more daughters, Little Alice and Beaver, follow her. She stops when she sees the camera guys look up, unprepared.Your Dicky ain't here, Alice.Jesus, I come by to help! I gotta go back to work anyhow, it ain't fair to Micky. He needs to be trainin'. He's not bein' handled right.It's none a my business, but I been goin' to meetin's, and they say let go and let Gahd. You don't need this shit, Micky.

O'Keefe turns back to Micky who's staring at MIKE \"MACHINE GUN\" MUNGIN, 27, 5'9\", 158 lbs, red trunks, in the opposite corner: HUGE, and in prison shape, big biceps, shoulders, neck. Micky's eyes widen with fear.That guy's not a welter weight.Is there gonna be a press conference?We were lookin' at tape today on Belinc and I think if Micky cuts off the ring in most rounds --Don't, Micky! I don't want ya gettin' hurt before the fight! He rushes out after Alice, George, Red Dog, Sherry leaving Micky and Charlene behind. Hear more SIRENS, SCREAMS from the street. Micky can't take it, jumps up.Guys, come on, back up. Cops back up from Charlene and O'Keefe... Blood spilling into Micky's eyes, holds up his left hand, which Charlene looks at.How's ya hand?!Looks bettah.Why don't ya come down to the gym if ya want? Ya fat fuck, look atcha.It's bettah for ya if ya don't see it, Micky, it's just gonna make ya feel bad. [turns to everyone] What are you lookin' at? He ain't gonna be on TV, it's his crazy brothah.
