{"American-Milkshake": {"JOLIE": {"raw_line": "All my life, my parents have told me I'm smart and talented. That I can be anything I wanna be when I grow up. Getting into the West Branch Magnet Program was supposed to be some kinda honor. They probly thought I'd grow up to be a doctor, or a lawyer, or scientist that cures cancer and junk. I mean for me school has always been a breeze.But when I look around, I just feel surrounded by dorks.All I want, is to be like the kids on varisty, who live in the Maple Ave towers.The maple ave kids are coming up from nothing. I mean, their only shot at college is balling. And they've got girls blowing up their pagers twenty-four seven.I pray to God I make varsity. I'd do anything to be like the Maple Ave. kids.I support you no matter what. But I can't be changin' no diapers.I've been fucking Henrietta for a while. She's the best. She's pregnant with someone else's baby but I'm cool with that. In fact, I think that's why I like her so much. She's kinda thugged out.Your stomach's smooth.I think you look more beautiful like this than anything. I wish you could be this way forever. We'd be so happy like this.I love you.Hey, Mr. Aaronson.You got my check?I guess.Henrietta's adopted. She lives in a big house like me. Her parents pay me to tutor her in geometry. She's kind of an outcast. I think that's why we click. Plus, our moms both work for the same law firm. They fly all over the country doing somethin'.Uh, I don't know. Maybe....you know... Geometry's a hard thing. Algebra leads to it and if you dont get that then-Yea.Thanks.My great great grandfather was a famous black face performer.They used to call him the greatest performer of all time. But now. Kids at school have never even heard of him. I mean not even magnet kids in AP history have heard of him.Hey, can I use the bathroom?Naw, not till Monday they said.Yeah right.Lucky bastards.This sucks. All the minorities get an excused absence for the Million Man March.But me, I'm stuck in school like a bama.I wish I was one of them. I wish I was one of them. I wish I was one of them. Fuck.I'm supposed to tutor Henrietta every Sunday. She's getting an F in math. She knows how to do it though. She's flunking on purpose.She's so gangster.Oh you mean like netscape?I got you. Dont forget to get me my bio homework back.My great great grandfather had a song, Hallelujah I'm a Bum. Tupac had a song, I'd Rather Be an N.I.G.G.A., so we can get drunk and smoke weed all day. I always thought they were really similar.Yea.As a white boy at West Branch I'm just not cool.But making the team would change my life forever.It's my one shot to fit in with the Maple Ave kids. To actually be somebody!Making the team, felt like the most important thing in my life.As a white boy I just didn't fit in, not in Takoma Park. But now...I was practically black.I even ditched class to work on my hops.I was the last bama on the list! If Francisco hadn't been arrested I'd still be a loser! I'd be just another Joe Shmoe Lame-oh geek in the Blair High School Magnet.Oh hey, can your mom give you a ride home later. There's something I gotta do.2.5's right?Tupac. Biggie. Snoop Dog. Easy-E. Dr. Dre. Suge Knight. Mr. T.Alright, bye Dad.Wow. That is pretty bad. It smells like a dead mouse or something....what? No.Yea but, I can't. Not no more. We can't be hanging out any more. You understand though right?Henrietta, I told you. I made the basketball team. I'm a Blazer now.L...Look. If I make the NBA I'm gonna take care of you and your baby. We're gonna live in a big house in Potomac. Be rich, have maids. That's the reason I'm doing this. Can't you see that? Can't you be happy for me?Do you need a token for the bus or some junk?I felt bad but,Henrietta had rich white parents. And after I made the teamI realized, compared to me she wasn't thugged out at all. She was just bad at Algebra.For a while I was worried her Dad, Mr. Aaronson, would be mad.But he was cool. He even offered me 20 bucks to mow the lawn. So, everything worked out.I guess.Oh yeah.Which one?I don't feel like it. I told you.Man, if I can't get in when we're up thirty in the preseason then I'm never gonna play.Yeah, for thirty seconds.Already?Because you know I love you.What?You're the best. I love you forever Henrietta.I promise to God.I'd do anything for you.I know. They were just photos. Everyone makes mistakes.What? No. Lemme see.Wow. I heard Francisco got arrested but I didn't know he made the paper.That's a rumor, duh. They just took photos.I heard.Who?I'm not with that girl man. I just tutor her in Algebra.What? Yeah.What? No. I just. The sun was in my eyes.What's up?My programming skills aren't that good. But we can copy Haroon's code and just change the variable names.Yea.I don't know man. I think she's into me.Hmmm.Yeah.Oh yeah. All the way past C hall.Through parenting class? Let's just go the long way.I just tutor her in Algebra. You know how we need community service hours to graduate, well...It's hot as a mug in here.The season hadn't even started and my life had changed forever.I swear, exactly when we kissed someone yelled score.It felt like a million bucks.I felt guilty cuz of Henrietta, but as Tu Pac says, \"Only God can judge me.\"I did wonder if Henrietta's Dad, Mr. Aaronson, even knew she was pregnant.But for some reason it just never came up.Yea he's just afraid to step to me directly because he knows varsity has my back. Don't stress though. He's just a bully.Ray is just a bully. All you have to do is hold your ground a little probably.He'll back off.Come on dude, isn't that why you always carry that Batman figure around?Because Batman's the only superhero that is just a regular guy.Fine, then just stay close to me and the team will get your back, I swear.Done.Hey.What's up?What's up?What's up?See man. Ray can't mess with us now. We're rolling too deep.Yea. No prob.Jump in the trunk dude. It's not far.I'll bring you some cinnamon twists too!She's not my girl.Come on man. Coast is clear.And just like that, with Marley arrested and Arius doing in-school, I might just get some playing time?Woah. Dude. Are you alright?I'm sorry man.No. Come on man.Well at least you've still got your teeth.Let me get you back. Come to the movies with me tonight dude. The new Ice Tea flick is out. The tickets on me. Coke, popcorn, the whole nine.It's an Ice Tea flick and it's gonna be tight as a mug.We had an early game today against Paint Branch. And I scored 3 points.Come on. Enough with that. I washed my hands already. So I can please you.You want the truth. How is this?I thought you said you didn't fuck any of them.Did you suck their dicks?Well everyone at school says you did. And now they're saying there's a video and that's why Francisco and Merly got arrested.How do you know?Why did you let them take pictures?For what?Where did you sleep that night?Dang. I know. I'm sorry. I'm such an idiot.Why didn't you come to me then?I know. Damn it. You could have slept on my couch, easy. My parents wouldn't have even cared.You lied to me.How do I know?Haroon and I better get going. We gotta finish our Magnet project for R&E.I would but I can't. This is like the biggest project of the year.I know but Mr. Donaldson just assigned a huge thing-What are you talking about?She's just like that. She's a cheerleader.What do I want to do?What do I wanna do? I mean, you know that, right?Spud Web was five seven.What?UH-I'm really sorry, Mr. Aaronson, but-Yea.What?So?What? I thought we were gonna play street fighter?What are you scared I'm gonna smoke you like a blunt again?I'd turn you into a straight dikfor.You don't know what a dick's for!? You fucking homo-thug!Damn, Ray really smashed your face didn't he?I never lied to them.I love them both.Uh, Keep it simple stupid.Keep it simple stupid.Arius, man. When can I see the VHS tape you mentioned?Yeah, but-Henrietta didn't really fuck any of them, did she? I mean she was just posing nude for some photos, right?How can it just escalate?Dude? If this is a psych, you got me. OK? Just tell me the truth.It got erased I thought.Damn.Yeah.Shit man. I'm sorry dude. You deserved an A. It was tight as a mug.Aw, man.Yea. ...Henrietta Aaronson.This. This tape is going on. I saw it. The whole team saw it.You lied to me. Why?Don't you have anything to say?! Don't you?!How could you lie to me like this? How could you make a fool of me like this?Why? Why not? I love you.I think we shouldn't see each other anymore.You do?Kiss me one last time.I'll tell your Dad I'm not your tutor anymore.What's this?Oh. One of those tracks isn't even out yet though.Just like us I guess.Dude, I was thinking about getting some Tims.So you haven't noticed all the kids on the team wear them?Do you have these in a size ten. And bring a what - Size 7? Yeah size seven for Haroon.Mr. Aaronson.We just ate. But thanks.Oh. Uh, Henrietta didn't tell you? I, uh, can't tutor anymore.No, it's just, the team. Basketball is taking up so much time now is all. Getting ready for the playoffs and everything. Honestly, I'd be so tired I wouldn't even be any good.I could probably recommend someone. My buddy Haroon's older brother maybe.No. I'm good. It's-.What do you mean?What evil eye?Who? Henrietta?Henrietta Aaronson?I tutored her in algebra. Her dad is a long time friend of the family.I know, right. You'd have to be twisted to get down with that.I never had to use a condom with Henrietta.Dang. I don't see one here.Well maybe we can just do it a little bit.I won't even do it. I'll just feel it.In my head I kept thinking about dribbling a basketball down an endless basketball court, playing point guard in the biggest game of the year. The Springbrook game.That kept me focused so I wouldn't bust in about two seconds.I was gonna pull out but...Uh, I better not keep going.Yea.No. Do you?Really? Shit, so do I. All the time.So SO cool.As the season rolled on, the Taco Hut became the spot to be. Some days I would just look around and soak it in. I couldn't believe I was even here.Sure.Holly shit. You need help. Someone call an ambulance.I dunno.Who you got?Owwwww! My thumb. Sharp pain just shot all the way threw my neck.Yeah.No, I'm good.I don't know?Why me?Really? Dang.Duh. Come on, Dad. Just drive.Don't worry, I know how to help Henrietta get her shit together.Dad. Come on. You know what I mean.Henrietta, your Dad showed me the test. It was bad, but if you get an A on your last exam you'll still pass.You just gotta learn to distribute.What?What is it then? You can talk to me. You can tell me anything.What? You mean the Bowe fight?Yeah. It's pretty much just a team thing though.Oh. I didn't know that. Well, why don't I just call you when I figure out what time we're going.Is it?Oh.Well, I don't know. You have a lot of studying.Cliff Livingston. I forgot about that guy.Henrietta. Come on? We're not together anymore.He won the dunk contest. The guy's a beast. You're way out of your league.No he didn't.That's not true. Where did you hear that?It must have been good for Henrietta too, because afterwords, she didn't mention joining the team to the Bowe fight, she didn't mention Christine, she didnt mention nothing.Still though, I was worried she'd show anyway. If she did, I didn't know what I was gonna do.Yeah.Yeah, when I first got there she didn't even have any clothes on.She threw her pajamas into the fireplace. I swear to God.Yeah - the need for something.I don't have to. She's pregnant.Not for a fight?Hey.Yeah. I did.When did you get a pager?! That is tight, dude.Strangely Henrietta never showed. I should have been relieved, but instead I felt awful. It was like yesterday we were in love and today she didn't even care I was with Christine.Ms. Bart. I know you're the cheerleading coach and all, but this really better be important. I'm supposed to be in the weight- room by now.Christine?Well, maybe you should get one of those things and check it out.Yeah.No worries. My Dad will let me put it on his credit card. Trust me.No. It's not your fault. I gotta run though. Let's talk about this after the game, OK? The team needs me.I'm ok though. I can play through it. do you understand. I just gotta do this?Tonight I'm gonna play for you and our baby.I got stuck with no toilet paper, coach.I know. It wasn't my fault. I gotta be light on my feet.My hand is all better. Look.That night. I never played. None of us did. Because there never was a game. Before the opening tip even kicked it off a fight between schools broke out in the crowd. Some fired a gun twice, and all hell broke loose.Yeah. Was that gun shots?OJ Simpson....not guilt.I made JV that year.They're not rescheduling our game? That's insane.It's not fair man. I mean everyone got suspended on the team but me. Just because I'm in the Magnet.Are you sure you wanna do that? We're in the middle of C hall.Really? On Mr. Applebaum's door? Yall have been warring. He's gonna know it was you.Jesus Christ, man.You just sprayed painted `thugg life' on Mr. Applebaum's door.You could get suspended for that.What's gotten into you?Are you serious?It's for your own good. This car belongs to Principal Ganus.What's that supposed to mean.Come on what?Dude. It's not like that. She's gonna get an abortion. She comes from a wealthy family.I don't know. I don't know what it means. It just happened.Once everyone heard that I got Christine pregnant, it was like I was the coolest kid in school.All the kids from the team wanted to hang at my place while my parents were gone. And even some cheerleaders came too.I told them all it was Haroon who spray-painted `Free Mike Tyson,' and even he was cool too.We even smoked a blunt. It was our first time gettng blazed and drunk.Don't worry.I told you I'm on it. First thing when my parents get back. But this is the best time to do it because we dont have to wear a condom. Come on, let's go upstairs. Trust me.Forreal?Who's there?Damn Henrietta. You scared the shit out of me.What? What are you doing in my basement bathroom?Shhh. People are sleeping.Whao.Henrietta, relax.Come on, I know you have friends Henrietta.The next day I found out Christine had the abortion on her own. She said she asked the doctor to see the fetus.The doctor said she wasn't supposed to showed it, but did anyway.Christine said the dead fetus looked like a baby squirrel. Like the ones that fall out of the nest and are on the sidewalk dead with no fur yet. I guess it went well though.After that Arius said not to worry about anything. That Christine would be cool, and Henrietta was just fucked up anyway.He even invited me back to his place. It was the first time I had ever been to Maple ave.Everybody played this ghetto version of Jin Rummy called `Tunk.'Naw. I gotta see this.Wow.Why wont it go play or whatever?Oh yea.I wasn't sure what to make of it all. Why Henrietta's parents never know she was pregant until too late? Or why I never said something myself? It was like none of it really mattered, or was even real at all, until it was too late.After that I used the internet to find a bunch of places that would take Henrietta's baby up for adoption. It wasn't easy, but I found all the information right from Haroon's basement, using Netscape.Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're perfect. All I have to do is convince Henrietta.I don't know. Our sessions are in the kitchen now.It's weird, I don't really care if I make the NBA anymore.I don't know.I do but there's something I gotta do.Hey. What's up? Uh. I brought over my Super Nintendo. I thought the baby might want it.No. Come on. I'm just trying to show you I actually care.And I brought this too.Yeah. I'm not gonna need it anymore so.I'm not playing next year. I want to focus on my studies.Oh. Wow. Well. Uh, before you name him, I was kinda thinking maybe we could discuss, uh,Well,I was also thinking maybe we could talk about the possibility of you giving up your baby for adoption?Well. Yeah. I guess so. But at the same time, it just doesn't seem like the smartest thing. I've already found a really wealthy, well educated, good meaning couple who'd like to meet up with you about it.Don't you even want to think it over for a few days? I mean, look how lucky your parents are to have you. You'd be making some couple just as happy. And your child would have more opportunities. I mean you're still in High School, know what I mean?What?", "clean_line": "life parents told smart talented wanna grow getting west branch magnet program supposed kinda honor probly thought grow

in these woods, Jolie. Why'd you want to meet out here anyway?You dont want to be seen with me do you? Cus I'm pregnant.You wanna make out with me?...Why?I knew you'd be back.Whatever.You promise.Are you gonna help take care of my baby?Wait. I want you to know... There's some stuff. I feel like you're the only one I can trust, the only one I can talk too. Like about when I ran away, and let those kids take photos of me. I couldn't tell anyone but you. You know that right?Jolie's stupid. He'll believe anything. But I like him. I've been failing algebra just so he can tutoring me.The thing is. He's not like other guys. I mean, he's on the team, but he's not really a cool kid. I've always hated the cool kids.Hey, can I bum a cigarette?Whatever.Thanks.Yea. I guess so.You know I saw you with that Cheerleader.Just tell me yall are hooking up. It's OK if you are. I just want the truth.Yeah. Francisco got arrested. What about it?I didn't.Jolie. It's none of your fucking business.They're not arrested. They got questioned and shit and then they got suspended.Because I hear all the Maple Ave stuff.Look, that's all beside the point. Whatever you heard about me at school, they don't know shit. It's a lie. I already told you. I ran away from home. That's it. Now leave me alone.I told you. I needed money.Duh, an abortion. Does that make you feel better. But I decided I want this baby Jolie. I want a real family. So I went to Pizza Hut for dinner instead. The one on University Boulevard, do you want a receipt or something?I told you. I slept at the ATM machine. Now stop it.But I love you. I just want to be with you now. And put all that in the past.We had just met.Jolie. No.I didn't. I would never.Don't you trust me?Jolie, my Dad is picking us up. I thought you were gonna help me study?I have a huge test tomorrow and if I don't pass this class I have to go to summer school.Haroon. Would you mind letting me talk to Jolie in private?The only time we go out is to the movies, and you're always late, and it's always the late show.Jolie. I saw Christine was all over you at school.Tell me something. What do you really want to do with your life?Why do you repeat everything I say?You're five-eight.Jolie.Dad, we're fucking studying here! Do you mind?Dad, have you seen how fucking fat I am!?Dad, we all know the story of you saving kids in the ghetto, ok?Jolie's bailing, Dad. Come on.Dad. Just drive please.He'd knock me out for the rest of my life.Jolie, you are soaking wet. What's going on? Why did you want to meet here in the middle of the night?What the fuck?How could I tell you when you never listen?Sometimes love is not enough.I just couldn't tell you about Maple Ave., Jolie. I just couldn't let you down. Your a Magnet kid. Your smart. Your excellent at computer, math and science. You don't understand where I'm coming from. What's important to me.I think you're right.Yeah. This time I think you're actually right.I never meant any of that to happen. Things just got out of control.Thanks. Oh, and here. I want you to have this back.It's Milkshake. The 95 R&B mix you gave me at our second tutoring session.Yea, I know. And some are older. It's kind of fucked up.Just like everyone.Dad.Dad!I don't care if I go to Summer School!This shit is meaningless! Who gives a crap!?You really think I don't know how to do that shit?That test isn't why I was so mad.I wasn't invited with you guys to the Tyson fight tomorrow. The one on pay TV. I heard everyone was going and I just flipped out. I mean what's the deal?Yeah. Bowe, Tyson, whatever. The point is the whole team's going.No it's not. Wendel, Arius, and Codroy are all bringing girls.Well the fight is at eight, right?Yeah. And everyone's going to Muhammad Ali's Rotiserie Chicken at City Place.Yeah.You know Spud Web only gets a roster spot because he's a circus freak. He shouldn't be there, and that's why he sells tickets. Don't you get it. He's not good, he's just a draw. Is that what you want to be, a circus freak?The league is about making money. Jolie, the only reason you even got on varsity is because your Dad paid for the new uniforms. You never would have made it even with Francisco getting arrested. Don't you realize that?Yes he did. They cost over two thousand dollars. How could you not know that? I mean you made Varsity at Blair after being cut from JV last year. When have you ever seen that happen?My Dad talking to your dad on the phone in the kitchen.I still love you, though. None of that matters to me.Dad, we're studying here! Do you mind?Jolie.How could you?I'm catching you cheating with Christine! You asshole!Don't lie to me. You think I dont know shit. She's pregnant with your baby.You think the Maple Ave. kids don't hear mad junk about the Magnet kids.I know about all that stuff, how y'all hooked up during floor hockey intramurals under the trampoline. Everything. You think I don't have friends? I have friends!You think I'm a fool? I watched you make out with her on the Power-pad two second ago!Oh yeah. Let him in.Did Jaguar 64 finally come out?Your practice Jersey!Really? Why not?Jolie. Thank you. It smells like you. Someday little Benny will wear it. That's what I've decided to name him, Benny.What?Jolie. How could you even say that? I've wanted a family of my own, a real family, since as long as I can remember.
