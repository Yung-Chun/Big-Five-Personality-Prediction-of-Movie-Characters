{"His-Girl-Friday": {"HILDY": {"raw_line": "Hello, Skinny. Remember me?Hello, Maisie.No, just visiting. Tell me, is the lord of the universe in today?No, never mind -- I'll blow my own trumpet.I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.What did you say, Bruce?Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.I'll come a-running, pardner.Thanks, Bruce.Hello, Beatrice. How's \"Advice to the Lovelorn\"?Point of information -- what does a girl say on meeting her divorced husband? OR:Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.Hello, Walter. Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?Editorials?I don't like to interfere with business, but would you boys pardon us while we have a little heart-to- heart talk?You won't miss anything. You'll probably be able to hear him just as well outside as here.Mind if I sit down?May I have a cigarette, please?Thanks. A match?How long is what?Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed. \"-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!\"I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.Done what?Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write: 'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.What home?Oh, yes -- we were to have it right after our honeymoon -- honeymoon!All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --What?!!Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?I have a lunch date. I just want --No, I can't.Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.Just what I said. That's what I --That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --You bet I've got a better offer.I know, Walter, but I --You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!Listen, Walter --Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!You -- you --What's the matter?Dead?Sweeney? Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?Well, haven't you got anybody else?No!Keep away --That's what I'm afraid of. \"Any time -- any place -- anywhere!\"Get away, Svengali.Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --Please! Will you just --I'm not working for any other paper!Look at this!Do you see this? Do you know what an engagement ring is?I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.You can't sell me that, Walter.That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.Bermuda.Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.He's in the insurance business.It's a good, honest business, isn't it?Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you. So long, Walter, and better luck next time.Thanks...Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.Afraid? I should say not!Better.Now you got me.You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!Allow me.I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.Nobody else.How's everything, Gus?Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.I guess so.No -- just coffee, Gus.It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.Isn't it sweet of Walter -- still wanting to protect me?I might have, Walter, but you were never there.Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must have slipped.Gus, this --Thank you.You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.Thanks, Gus.No. It's strong. But I like it that way.He certainly -- hic -- does!What now?You said it.If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.We're not interested.Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train. And no tricks, Walter!Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?Better make that a certified check, Walter.Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.So long, husbands.One at a time, boys.No, I'm not back for good. I'm just covering the Earl Williams story for Mr. Sweeney who had a sudden attack of something but will be all right by tomorrow. No, I haven't made up with Walter Burns -- far from it! As a matter of fact, I'm leaving tonight for Albany and I'll be married tomorrow morning. The lucky man is Mr. Bruce Baldwin, a gentleman in the insurance business -- and when I say gentleman, I mean gentleman! Are there any other questions?Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?Thanks, boys. That's all I want to know.I know, I just want to give him a thrill.All right, boys, now that everything is settled, deal me in.Hello, this is Hildy Johnson. Get me Walter Burns. Hello, Walter. How's the old double- crosser?How about that check? All right, Mr. Burns, but remember, no checkee -- no story. Well, as soon as they decide whether you live or not will you have that new man of mine call me up? Yes, sir. All right, boys. Up a dime.And up a dime.Three bullets! Any good?Oh, I'll think of something.Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.I'm getting married tomorrow.Kings and sixes.'Kings and sixes The pot affixes'... Poetry. I learned that at my grandma's knee.I don't know why you boys are so good to me.Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see -- -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.I made it up just now, and who's asking you? I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.Fine. And here's a kiss for you.Now, darling, you go back to the hotel and pack and you and Mother pick me up here about half-past five. Goodbye, dear.I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?I thought so. Come on, I'm in a hurry.You didn't mean to kill that policeman?What are your beliefs, Earl?How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?\"Production for use only.\" Well, maybe that's the answer.Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.Sure. What's the purpose of a gun, Earl?Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?Very simple, Earl.No, Earl, not at all. Who sent you the flowers, Earl?Isn't that her picture?Same way you did. Through that gate.All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.That's awful kind of you, Sheriff. I've got to get started on my interview. See you later.I won't, Earl.Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you.They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.Who is it?Give me that!Hello! Hello! Bruce?... what?... Where are you?... You're where?... How did that happen?... I'll be right over!I know you didn't, Bruce.Let him out of here, Lieutenant.And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!You can let him out on bail, can't you?You'll take fifty and like it!You'll get into a worse one if you don't.What's the matter?The check, Bruce!Yes, wasn't it?I'm sure you haven't any.Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!The Criminal Courts Building.No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.Well, the story's practically finished. I'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger.No, you stay here. I'm not taking any more chances. I'll be down in three minutes -- and don't you dare move!It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies. Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns, please.This is Hildy Johnson... Oh, I can give it up all right. Without a single quiver. I'm going to live like a human being -- not like you rats. Oh, is that you, Walter dear? Oh, I didn't mean \"dear.\" That was just habit, I guess. Oh, be yourself, Walter. I've got some news for you... Yes, I got the interview, but I've got some news that's more important.Better get a pencil out and write it down. All ready? Get this, you double-crossing chimpanzee, there ain't gonna be any interview and there ain't gonna be any story... Huh? That certified check of yours is leaving with me in twenty minutes. And if I ever see you again, it's going to be just too bad... Eh?... Oh, you don't know what I'm angry about, do you? If you come over I'll be very glad to tell you the story of Louie's watch. I dare you to come over, you -- you -- skunk in sheep's clothing! And bring that bodyguard of yours, too -- you'll need him....And I just want you to listen to one more thing.Hear that? That's the interview I wrote... Yes, I know we made a bargain. I just said I'd write it -- I didn't say I wouldn't tear it up. Yes, it's all in little pieces now, Walter, and I hope to do the same for you some time!And that's my farewell to the newspaper game. I'm going to live a normal life and have a home.I'm going to be a woman, not a newsgetting machine. I'm going to have babies and nurse them and love them and give 'em cod liver oil and worry about their new teeth -- and the minute I catch one of them even looking at a newspaper, I'm going to brain him! Where's my hat?I'll take it. What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!Now where was that hat? Oh, yes.Well, goodbye, you wage-slaves. When you're crawling up fire escapes, getting kicked out of front doors, and eating Christmas dinners in one- armed joints, don't forget your pal, Hildy Johnson! And, remember, my husband sells insurance!\"It takes a heap o' livin' to make a house a home.\"Ahhh --Morning Post?... Get me Walter Burns -- quick! Hildy Johnson calling.Walter?... Hildy. Earl Williams just escaped from the County Jail. Yep... yep... yep... don't worry! I'm on the job!Cooley, I want to talk to you.There's money in it, Cooley.A lot of money. Four hundred and fifty dollars --Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?There goes another scrub lady.From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.Give me Walter Burns -- quick --Walter, listen. I've got the inside story on how Williams got the gun and escaped.It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.Keep the thanks, but just see that the money gets here!I thought so, too.No -- what?Hello -- Bruce! I thought you were downstairs in a -- What? Arrested again! What for this time, Bruce? Mashing! Oh, Bruce, can't I leave you alone for three minutes even? Well, where are you? The 27th Precinct? All right, I'll be right over -- I'll be over in twenty minutes, Bruce. If I ever see Walter Burns -- Get me Walter Burns... Hildy Johnson! Well, he was there just a minute ago! Have him call me back!If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire for me, will you? I'll be right back.Will you try --Louie!Have you got my dough?Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!Come on with that money!Where's the money?Here!So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!You know it is!No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?27th Precinct Station House?Put down that gun, Earl.You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your \"Production for Use\".Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.I don't blame you, Earl. If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.Earl, you must never do that again.Well, maybe you think I could!Don't talk too loud.Sure I do, Earl.Hello... Gimme Walter Burns -- quick!Hello -- hel -- Oh, hello, Bruce... Oh, Bruce, please -- I know I said I'd be down in fifteen minutes, but something terrific's happened! Hang on, Bruce -- Walter?... Hildy. Come over here -- right away!... Wait! Bruce, just a second, Bruce -- I'll explain everything. Walter! Get this: I've got Earl Williams... Yes! Here in the Press Room... Honest! On the level. Hurry -- I need you.Bruce, this is the biggest thing that ever happened... I just captured Earl Williams -- you know -- the murderer --Bruce, I'll be down -- Well, Bruce, the minute I turn him over to the paper I'll be right down. Bruce, don't you -- Bruce, I can't now -- I can't, don't you realize?Who's there?Wait a minute, Mollie.Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!Quiet, Mollie!Quiet, Mollie, quiet!How'd you get here, Earl?Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.Ssh!Just a second, Mike --- Mollie, I got it!Can you get in this desk?We'll get you out in ten minutes.All right -- all right!I'm coming! Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!Never mind! Just play dead.Shut up, you!Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.Give me a hand with her, will you?Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.Any news?Are you all right, now?A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.What's the matter with you boys? Afraid it might rain? If you want to go, I'll cover this end.Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!Mother!Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.But I never said anything like that!I said I was trying to catch one. You got it balled up, Mother.Let her alone! She's goofy!Gee! The poor kid... the poor kid.Walter! D-did you see -- -- that?She jumped out of the window.Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!Now, let go of her, Louie. Listen, Walter, this'll get me in a terrible jam with my fianc\u00e9e and I don't stand so well with him now. Don't worry, Mother, this is only temporary.Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?Oh, get off that trapeze! There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!I know, but --Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?I'd like to think.I get it!Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.Huh!How much do you want on it?Where's some paper?Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?Hello, Bruce...BRUCE!! How'd you get out?Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam --Okay, Walter.We'll explain the whole thing to them.Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that. Walter!Thanks.Oh, she was here.Out some place.Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.Oh, yes. Here it is.Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back.All right, Walter.Fine.Where's Butch?He'd better hurry. The boys'll be coming back to phone.Where's Bruce?What tickets?Is he coming back here?Who is it?That's Bensinger. That's his desk.Bensinger -- of the Tribune.Double-crossing swine!I'm finished.Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?Where's Mrs. Baldwin?What happened?Where's the old lady?Oh-h-h... was she hurt?Louie!What did you do with her?-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?Don't tell me -- was she killed?Dead... dead! That's the end!What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh- h... what can I do now? How can I ever face him? Oh, I hope he never comes back!I'm looking at you -- you murderer!Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?Nobody? Morningside three-one-two-four.Is this the Community Hospital?Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?Shut up, will you? You sure? Nobody?Lafayette two-one-hundred.Ring that number, will you?Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.Yes.I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother. Oh-h... I'm going out and find her!Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --Let go o' me. What's the idea?Take your paws off me!Let me go! Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!Nobody's trying to put anything over on you. I'm getting out of here and you can't stop me!What do I know about Williams?Look out, you --No, you don't! Walter!I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.With a bag of marshmallows.No!Mother!Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me.Mother!He's harmless.He can't hurt anybody. You've got his gun.That's murder!What?Who was bribing you?Wait a minute! Let go there!Hanging an innocent man to win an election!Who did you talk to?Who's 'they'?Go on, you'd kill your mother to get elected!You guys better quit politics and take in washing.Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.You're going to run into the Governor.How was that for a tight squeeze?Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?In a way.We've certainly been in some swell jams.Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.Don't remind me. That's how we happened to --That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --I don't know what to do, Walter.All right. Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!Thanks.Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?Walter!What would you do if it was a daughter?What's the matter with my brains?Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.What!Nobody's going to rush me into anything! You keep away from me!That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.You're not fooling anybody.What would you do with a gun in your back?If I know where he is.I will -- if he will.Walter, you can't do that!Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!Walter!Counterfeit money! That's the money you sent me, Walter!

Sure you don't want me to go in with you?I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.Mr. Burns!Mr. Burns --I'm Bruce Baldwin!Yes!Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.Oh.Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.Where are we going?No -- she didn't.Oh, I'll take the same, I guess. And a glass of milk.Yes.Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.Oh, it isn't like that.No. My mother.I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.Well, I'll try to give her one.Just for the first year.Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.You've forgotten my milk.He hasn't brought my milk yet.You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.Too hot?Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?Anything the matter?Just what is the lowdown on Williams?Are you sure Williams is not all there?But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?How long would the interview take?We could take the six o'clock train, Hildy. If it would save a man's life.I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.But --I could get a company doctor in twenty minutes.About twenty-five hundred dollars.All right, dear.The five hundred? Sure.But --But I don't gamble, Hilda!All right. One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.I don't know. This makes me feel funny.I feel I ought to take care of her.Well, I'm independent, too.Well, of course, if you put it that way.I'm beginning to realize that.Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.Well, she'll know some day.Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.Thanks a lot.Oh, sure. Well, thanks for everything.So long.Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.All right. Wait a minute.All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?He's crazy. I haven't any watch.I haven't got --I never saw it before.My hat!I'm innocent. I didn't do anything. I never stole a watch in my life.I lost my wallet.That's right here. Gee, it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition.I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.Did you finish the interview?But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --Hildy!Hildy!Not through any help of yours, Hildy.I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail... I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.Did you say anything, Mister Burns?Oh. I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.Where'd she go?Hildy! Where's mother?Did you give her the money?Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.Thank you.And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here.I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.She's -- well, she's very motherly.

I got company.I'm busy, Duffy.What?You're crazy. Where's Mac?They can't do that to me!Give me that call on Duffy's wire! Hello -- Mac? Burns. Where's the Governor? -- What do you mean, you can't locate him? Mac, you know what this means. We're the only paper in town defending Earl Williams and if he hangs tomorrow we're washed up! Find the Governor and when you find him tell him we want that reprieve!... Tell him I elected him and I can have him impeached! Sure, you can do it, Mac -- I know you can. I always said you were the greatest reporter in the country and now you can prove it. Get going! Attaboy!The greatest reporter in the country! First I gotta tell him what news to get! Gotta tell him how to get it -- then I gotta write it for him afterward! Now if you were a decent City Editor --Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.Scram, you guys.How long is it?You know what. How long since we've seen each other?Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?Oh, yes I would. I'd know you any time --I notice you still remember it.You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.Now, that's a nice thing to say.Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did.Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.I haven't any hard feelings.Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.You can break it, can't you?Sure you can. Come on.What do you mean by that?You mean you're not coming back to work here?You've had a better offer, eh?Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!You're losing your eye. You used to be able to pitch better than that. Hello... Yeah... What? Sweeney? Well, what can I do for you?Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to. How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.Sweeney.Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless -- Hildy!You've got to help me, Hildy.It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.Where'd you meet this man?Bermuda... Rich, eh?What's his line?The insurance business?Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.Too bad I couldn't see this guy first. I'm pretty particular about whom my wife marries.Say, could I meet him?You're not afraid, are you?All right then, come on and let's see this paragon. Is he as good as you say?Then what does he want with you?Nothing personal. I was just asking.After all --No kidding?What for?Oh, I'm sorry.Have Duffy call me in the restaurant in twenty minutes.Thanks.I can see right away my wife picked out the right husband for herself.Already married! Hildy, why didn't you tell me?Congratulations again, Mr. Baldwin!Yeah? You'll have to excuse me -- I'm busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin here. Just leave your card with the boy.I'm very sorry, but I'm busy! Look -- -- there's the boy. Take your card and leave it with him.I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!You're Bruce Baldwin?Then who are you?Pete Davis! Well, Mr. Davis, this is no concern of yours and after this I'll thank you to keep out of my affairs!This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?That's right. -- Rubbers, too, I hope? A man ought to be prepared for any emergency.Attaboy! Come on, Bruce.Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?Just wanted to surprise you, I guess. Down! After you, Bruce! Come on, Hildy, my treat!How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!Oh -- after you, Hildy!Well, I can. I'm hungry. Roast beef sandwich -- rare. And some coffee.Good idea. How about you, Hildy?And don't put any rum in it, Gus.Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?Taking the train today -- and being married tomorrow?Mother? But your mother --Oh. Your mother -- well, of course, that relieves my mind.I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.Anyway, I'm glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things I couldn't give her. You know, Hildy is about the best reporter in the country -- and that goes regardless of sex. But all she really ever wanted was a home.I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!Yes, I know... Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...How's business, Bruce?I don't blame them.I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do.I see what you mean.Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.They would!Get this -- get Sweeney off that yarn and out of town on a two weeks' vacation -- and right away... All right, Duffy, keep your shirt on. Hildy's coming back... No. She doesn't know it yet. But she'll be there. I promise you, Duffy. And tell Louie to stick around.Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him. I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.Because it happened to be a colored policeman.Especially with an election coming up in a few days.All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.How?Yes, you could do it, Hildy. You could save that poor devil's life. You could -- but -- -- you're going away. I forgot.Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?What do you mean?All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young man. You let Hildy do this story for me and you can write out a $100,000.00 insurance policy for me. What do you say?Now you're talking!What tricks would I pull?What do you think I am -- a crook?All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?You haven't seen anything yet.Hello, my fine-feathered friend. Thought I might be hearing from you. What have you got to report?Going all right, eh?Doctor, will you please keep quiet a minute? How do you expect me to get any work done?Well, they haven't finished with me yet but I'm hoping to get my shirt back. Oh, no. I'm in the pink of condition. They found two new dimples.Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five. Thanks, Duffy. Stick around.Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.Exclusive? That's great.Never mind that. What's the story?You'll get it. Now what's the story? I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!No kidding, Hildy. Say, this isn't a rib?That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.Hold on a minute.Come here. There's a guy waiting in a taxi in front of the Criminal Courts building. His name is Bruce Baldwin. Can you do your stuff?Then scram! You've got about two minutes.Sorry to keep you waiting. How much was it again? Four hundred and fifty dollars? Hang on a second.I need four hundred and fifty dollars in counterfeit money. You know where I can get it?It's coming right over. I'm sending it over with Louis. Thanks for the story and good luck on your honeymoon.Yes. Where is he?I know. Where is he, I said.Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.Tell 'em it's a case of delirium tremens.Where do you think you're going?Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald!Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies! By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!We're going to take him over to my private office. Where's our phone?Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over. Give me Duffy!We'll lower it out of the window with pulleys. Quit stallin'.Hildy!Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!All the words you've got.Hello...! Hello!Call him a love-child, if you want to. Duffy!Give him the works. Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!Fine! Now, listen, Duffy -- I want you to tear out the whole front page... That's what I said -- the whole front page! Never mind the European war! We've got something a whole lot bigger than that. Hildy Johnson's writing the lead and I'll phone it over to you as soon as she's finished. Oh, Duffy! Get hold of Butch O'Connor and tell him I want him to come up here with half a dozen other wrestlers -- right away! Tell him we'll run his picture on the sport page for two weeks straight. What? I've got a desk I want moved. Never mind what desk!Duffy -- Duffy! Operator! Operator! Get me Duffy back. Somebody cut us off!What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy! Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that?For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!Take the President's speech and run it on the funny page... What is it, Hildy?You mean the one who drank so much? Tillie!Get back in there, you mock turtle!No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office.Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --Hildy!I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.Ts! Ts! Ts!I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?That's the kind of stuff they want!Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure.Duffy. Good. Stick close.Now the moon's out!Fine. Three taps is me. Don't forget! You're sitting pretty, now. Got enough air?Is that better? Now breathe deep!Attaboy!That's the stuff! Lam it into 'em, Hildy.Hello! Duffy, ready? Here we go!\"In the darkest hour of the city's history --\"Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All right. Duffy's getting old!Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.Railroad tickets.Didn't you hear him? Of course he's coming back here. Keep going, will you?Duffy!What's his name?I'll handle him.The Tribune, eh? Watch me!Hello, Bensinger.Quite a coincidence, my running into you tonight. Isn't it, Hildy?I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.The poem?... The poem was great!Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?We need somebody like you. All we've got now are a lot of low-brows. Like Johnson here.Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you. Mervyn, isn't it?Of course! Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff. How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?I'll give you a hundred and a by- line.Let him have everything he wants. Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man. He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!Exactly!It doesn't have to rhyme!I'll keep you in mind.Bon jour!Mademoiselle from Armontieres, parlay --Duffy! Got this!A rat from the Tribune is coming over to get a job -- Bensinger, the guy I told you about. Handle him with kid gloves. Tell him to get busy writing poetry... No, we don't want him. Stall him along until the extra comes out. Then tell him his poetry stinks and kick him downstairs.You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.Tear into it, will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin!Finished!Duffy! All right -- here we go! And got it out as soon as you can. I want this paper out on the streets in half an hour! \"So once more the Morning Post --\"Hildy, you think I could? After this story? Here! You're just nervous.Who is it?It's Louie!What's the matter?What did you do with her?You been in a fight?Take that mush out of your mouth!Where is she? Tell me!Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.Was she? Did you notice?It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything. Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?Look at me, Hildy --If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!You stay here. I'll find out everything.Hello -- hello...Who? Hello, Butch! Where are you?What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?Oh, for -- H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here! Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello? I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em! Duffy! Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation! Duffy!!Duffy!!!! Duffy!!!! Well, where is Duffy? Diabetes! I ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease. Louie.It's up to you.Beat it out and get hold of some guys.Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them. We've got to get this desk out of here.You got plenty of money?I mean real money -- not counterfeit!And don't bump into anything.That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it. Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?If Louie doesn't come back in five minutes we'll get it out alone. There's millions of ways. We can start a fire and get the firemen to carry it out in the confusion.Come here. See if we can move it.Will you come here?When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!Don't open that!Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.Get out!What is it? Here!I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself.Are you trying to make me out a liar?You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman.My dear Hartman!The Morning Post is not obstructing justice or hiding criminals. You ought to know that.Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense. And you'll be an accessory!Are you referring to me, Madam?Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never saw this woman before in my life!Now, Madam -- be honest. If you were out joy-riding, drunk, and got into some scrape, why don't you admit it, instead of accusing innocent people?Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get bail.Madam, you're a cockeyed liar! And you know it!Come on, Sheriff, we've got to get bail.You grey-haired old Judas!Call Duffy!Do you want to get us scooped?Duffy! The Morning Post just turned Earl Williams over to the Sheriff.Duffy!Hartwell, you're going to wish you'd never been born!Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.Duffy! Get Liebowitz!This is the Morning Post you're talking to!Bigger men than you have found out what the power of the press is... President!... Yes -- and Kings!What's this?What did I tell you? An unseen power! What's your name?Murder, uh?When did you deliver this first?Out of the mouths of babes.Just a minute. All right, Mr. Pinkus. Let's have your story.Skip all that.Save that for the Tribune.Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.And your arrest. You'll each get about ten years, I think.Wait till those two future jailbirds read the Morning Post tomorrow.Don't tell me you were worried!Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through, Hildy.Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?Flip a coin.Ready.Well -- what is it?Hildy!Then why are you doing it?The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy!And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.Where'd you wire him?Sure.Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?I don't want to rush you. Take a couple of seconds.Hello, Judge!Now, wait a minute, Judge. This isn't a kidnapping. You've got the legal power to perform a marriage ceremony, haven't you?Now don't argue, Hildy. How about it, Judge?Then go ahead. Come on, Hildy.I will.Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!How about Bruce's?Sure, I can. Look at the policy I gave him! \"With this ring I thee wed and with all my worldly goods I thee endow: And thereto I plight thee my troth.\"Hildy, darling!It'll be Heaven!But, Hildy -- I can explain

"HARTMAN": {"raw_line": "I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too. 'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.Once and for all, I'm not going to hang anybody except at the legal hour... What? Don't threaten me, Bensinger! I'm not afraid of any newspapers. Yeah?... Oh, shut up! And, operator, I told you not to disturb me! I don't care who calls -- I don't want to be disturbed again till I tell you! How do you like that, Dr. Egelhoffer? Want me to hang williams at their convenience!You said it!Me, too.Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.I don't know --If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.What went off?A fine fair-weather friend you are!After all I've done for you --I'm very disappointed in you, Hildy Johnson.Just a minute! We've got him located.Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!There'll be no Red uprising!Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred deputies.I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.If you're talking about my brother- in-law, he's worked for the city fifteen years.What do you mean -- through?Fred!Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.There is a way out. I've got Williams surrounded, haven't I? What more do you want? Hello... Yes... Hello! Four hundred suppers! Nothing doing! This is a man-hunt -- not a banquet!... The twelve dollars includes everything!!That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away.Ah! For me!I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?For who?The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!Read it! Insane, he says. He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!An attempt to ruin us!We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?Ah, Fred -- Hello... this is Hartman --Sssh. Wait, Fred. What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!They got him! Wait a minute -- hold the wire. They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.I did. Hold the wire.No -- don't out me off.Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!Will you wait, Olsen? I'll tell you in a minute!Just one second --Just -- one -- second!What?I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.Hello, Olsen... Listen... Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there. Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.Just a minute, Johnson!Hold her, boys!You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.Hang onto her! Keep her in here!Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --You'll ask me to what?Close that door. Don't let anybody in or out.Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?All right, boys. Take her along. I got ways of making her talk.Gimme that.Where'd you get this?Not this gun!Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with!Where is Earl Williams? Where you got him?I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.What?Speak up! What do you know about this.No? Well -- Johnson, you're under arrest. You, too, Burns.I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.We'll just start by impounding the Post property. Is that your desk?Oh, you do, eh? All right, boys. Confiscate that desk.You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that. All right, boys. Take it.We'll take a chance on that, Burns. Go ahead, boys.What's the idea here?What?Just a minute. Did -- did -- -- this man have anything to do with it?What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?Did you get the Mayor?Hiding him? In here?What was that?Aha! I thought so! Stand back, everybody!Get your guns out!Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.You stand there!You there!You cover the window.No, you don't!Now then, everybody aim at the center. And when I say three --All right! Carl! Frank! One of you get on each side of the desk. Take hold of the cover.Now then! We got you covered, Williams. Don't try to move. Now! Everybody quiet and ready for an emergency. I'm going to count three.One!Two!Everybody ready? All right. Now then, up with it.Got you, Williams!Put the cuffs on those two!Hello, girlie -- gimme Cooley. Quick!Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into. But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!Cooley?... I caught Williams single- handed -- we're going to proceed with the hanging per schedule!Give me the District Attorney's office. I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary. Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.Get out of here, you!Throw him out, Frank.It's a frame-up!
