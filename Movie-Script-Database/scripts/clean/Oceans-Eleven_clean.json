I got into a self-destructive pattern.She already left me once. I don't think she'll do it again just for kicks.I don't know. How much do you guys make a year?My wife's.I'm a free man.Hello, Frank.My mistake... Table's cold anyway.Thanks.Ramon?This afternoon.You seen him?You kidding? I just became a citizen again.That would be criminal.Casinos.Oh, yes...Soon. Interested?Yes, Officer Brooks? My name is Danny Ocean. I'm just out, I'm supposed to check in with you within twenty-four hours. No, sir, I haven't gotten into any trouble. No drinking, no sir. No, sir, I wouldn't even think of leaving the state.The bouncer mentioned there was a game in progress. I hope I'm not intruding.I don't remember.Why should I mind? Two cards, please... I just got out of prison.I stole things.Gallery.Headmasks. Some.My fence seemed confident enough.Some people just lack vision.Well, that's all behind us now.I raise you five hundred dollars.What? Your girlfriend holding your purse?Contrary to what Mr. Ryan may say, Seth, I always check my cards before I make a bet. But be cafeful. I could tell from your face you're holding three of a kind or better. Five hundred to call. And two grand more.Thanks for the game, fellas. Hey, I hate to ask this, but could you sign something for me? It's for the guys in the joint. They just love all your shows.Unprofessional.Why do you think I came to see you first?Ten grand. Half of it's yours.I've got something better for you.It's tricky. No one's ever done it before. Needs planning, a large crew.Not loaded ones. It has to be very precise. There's a lot of security. But the take...Eight figures each.When's the last time you were in Vegas?The vault at the Bellagio.Yep.These feed into the cages at both the Mirage and the M.G.M. Grand. But every dime ends up here.Yes, they are. Think he'll mind?Like what, you think?As long as we're hitting these three casinos, we'll get our bankroll. Terry Benedict has a list of enemies.Aha.So...Uh-huh. So what are you saying?Really? I thought it was much harder than that --Jesus, Oscar, lower it a little, will ya?Yeah, thanks. You mind if we borrow a couple drawings for the night? Make some copies.'Preciate it.Why not do it?Because yesterday I walked out of the joint wearing my entire wardrobe and you're colddecking TeenBeat coverboys. Because the house always wins. You play long enough, never changing stakes, the house takes you. Unless, when that special hand comes around, you bet big. And then you take the house.A little. Did I rush it? It felt like I rushed it.It's never been tried.Reuben, you're right. Our eyes are bigger than our stomachs.Thank you so much for setting us straight. Sorry we bothered you.It was our pleasure.The Bellagio, Mirage, and the M.G.M. Grand.What do you have against him? That's the real question.That's why we've got to be very careful. We have to be precise. We have to be well-funded.Frank C. is in.Frank C. has developed a bad case of bronchitis and is putting in for a transfer to warmer climates.What about drivers?The Mormon twins?Electronics?How are his nerves?Phil Turentine.No shit? On the job?You send flowers?Basher...So he can walk on a rope.So he can juggle. We need a grease man, not an acrobat. Who else is on the list?Who else?We need Saul.He get religion?You can ask him.And Saul makes ten.Ten should do it, don't you think? You think we need one more? You think we need one more. Okay. We'll get one more.Hi, Linus. Sit down.A friend of Bobby Caldwell's. Sit down.Bobby told me about you. Said you were the best set of hands he ever saw. Didn't expect to find you working wallets on the subway.You're either in or out, right now.A plane ticket. A job offer.Bobby has every faith in you.You do this job, he'll be trading on yours.We'll get someone else who won't be quite as good. You can go back to feeling up stockbrokers.That's the best lift I've seen you make yet.America's playground.Gentlemen: welcome to Las Vegas.Everybody eaten? Good. Everybody sober? Close enough. Most of you know each other already. You probably haven't met Linus Caldwell before, he's Bobby's kid outta Chicago.Okay. Before we start, nobody's on the line here yet. What I'm about to propose to you happens to be both highly lucrative and highly dangerous. If that doesn't sound like your particular brand of vodka, help yourself to as much food as you like and safe journey. No hard feelings. Otherwise, come with me.Gentlemen: the 14000 block of Las Vegas Boulevard. Otherwise known as the Bellagio, the Mirage, the M.G.M. Grand. Together, they're the three most profitable casinos in Las Vegas...Gentlemen: the Bellagio vault. Located below the Strip, beneath two hundred feet of solid earth. It safeguards every dime that comes through each of the three casinos above it. And we're going to rob it.Courtesy of Frank Catton, new blackjack dealer at the Bellagio, security tapes from the three casinos.Okay. Bad news first. This place houses a security system which rivals most nuclear missile silos. First: we have to get within the casino cages ---- which anyone knows takes more than a smile. Next: through these doors, each of which requires a different six-digit code changed every twelve hours. Past those lies the elevator, and this is where it gets tricky: the elevator won't move without authorized fingerprint identifications ---- and vocal confirmations from both the security center within the Bellagio and the vault below - -Furthermore, the elevator shaft is rigged with motion detectors --Once we've gotten down the shaft, though, then it's a walk in the park: just three more guards with Uzis and predilections toward not being robbed, and the most elaborate vault door conceived by man. Any questions?The Nevada Gaming Commission stipulates: a casino must hold in reserve enough cash to cover every chip at play on its floor. As I mentioned, this vault services each of the three casinos above it. That means: during the week, by law, it must hold anywhere from sixty to seventy million dollars in cash and coin. On a weekend, between eighty and ninety million. On a fight night, like the one two weeks from tonight, the night we're going to rob it, at least a hundred and fifty million. Without breaking a sweat. Now there are eleven of us. Each with an equal share. You do the math.Oh, right. Sorry. I forgot to mention that.Yeah.Alright. Here's how we'll begin.First task: reconnaissance. I want to know everything that's going on in all three casinos. From the rotation of the dealers to the path of every cash cart...I wanna know everything about every guard, every watcher, anyone with a security pass. I wanna know where they're from, what their nicknames are, how they take their coffee...Most of all, I want you guys to know these casinos. They were built as labyrinths, to keep people in. I want you guys to know the quick routes out.Second task: power. On the night of the fight, we're gonna throw the switch on sin city. Basher, it's your show.Third task: surveillance. Casino security has an eye and ear on everything, so we'll want an eye and ear on them. Livingston...Why do they paint hallways that color?Uh-oh.Well...Fourth task: construction...We need to build an exact, working replica of the Bellagio vault.Something like that.Fifth task: intelligence. We need those codes, Linus. From the only man who has all three.Learn to love his shadow. Sixth task: transport...For now. You gotta walk before you crawl.Sixth task: transport...... Power, surveillance, transport...Get your wallet.It's Armani, Saul.Saul, you sure you're ready to do this?You're ready.There's a little over twenty grand there, Saul. Try to make it last.Bought you a fresh roll.Good luck, Lyman.29:47. Everything okay in there?What is it?Ex-wife.It's not. About that. Entirely.You said you needed a reason. Well, this is mine. When we started in this business, we had three rules. We weren't gonna hurt anybody. We weren't gonna steal from anybody didn't have it coming. And we were gonna play the game like we had nothing to lose. Well, I lost something. Someone. That's why I'm here.If things go to plan, I won't be the one who has to make that choice.How'd she look by the way? Tess...Hello, Tess.I'm out.Of prison. You remember. The day I went for cigarettes and never came back. You must have noticed.They said I'd paid my debt to society.You're not wearing your ring.My last day inside.Benedict?Whiskey and -- -- whiskey.You're doing a great job curating the museum.The Vermeer is quite good. Simple but vibrant. Although his work definitely fell off as he got older.And I still get Monet and Manet confused. Which one married his mistress?Right. Manet had syphilis.You don't know how many times I played this conversation out in my head the last two years.Yes.You were never easy. Okay. I'll make this quick. I came here for you. I'm gonna get on with my life, and I want you with me.I only lied about being a thief. But I don't do that anymore.Lie.No, he's very clear on both.Year and a half.I only have one?Does he make you laugh?You can't. But what you can do is not throw away another five years.Listen, you don't love me anymore, you want to make a life with someone else? Fine, I'll have to live with that. But not him.I'm not joking, Tess.Yes. But that doesn't mean I'm wrong.You said: you better know what you're doing.I know what I'm doing.Catching up.Danny Ocean.I was shocked myself. Imagine the odds.About the same. Everything you want is still on the other side.I just wanted to say hello. For old time's sake.-- I can't.You never know.So I should put those towels back.Good seeing you, Tess.Basher. What happened?So...By tomorrow?What -- is a pinch?Could a pinch take out the power of an entire city? Like, I don't...Where?You two ready?What are you doing?We got it. Let's go.Wait a minute.Where's Linus?There he is.He knows where we are.Alright, back it up, back it up!C'mon, c'mon...I say stay in the van, you stay in the van, got it? 'Cause you lose focus for one second in this game, and someone gets hurt.This is a problem.Who told you to do that?My wife.This isn't your call.This is my job.Pops, you won.Try to keep your tongue in your mouth.I'll just be a moment.Tess...I just came to say good-bye.Good-bye.Be good.I thought he might.How much longer do you think Mr. Benedict will be?No cameras in this room, huh? Don't want anyone seeing what happens here?He's not coming, is he?Who is?I guess Mr. Benedict didn't like me talking to his girl.Jesus, Bruiser, not 'til later.S'okay. How's the wife?Then we better get to work.You didn't really think I was gonna sit this one out, did you?I do now.Crawlspace. And I had to give away a couple mil.You think the kid bought it?Bobby Caldwell threw me into the pool first time. Least I could do is give his kid a push.Well, where's the fun in that? C'mon: Yen's got about three minutes of air left.Who do you like tonight?Tyson or Lewis.You looking for action?A buck it is.Livingston, we're set.Never. You?Now!No, but you're sweet to ask.Not yet. Okay.I'm sure he's fine.There's a Chinese man with a hundred sixty million dollars behind that door. Let's get him out.Okay.Counting down from twenty -- -- now.-- seventeen, sixteen, fifteen ---- eleven, ten, nine ---- one --I don't know.-- and someone gets hurt, yeah yeah. I don't hear Yen complaining.Do it.Amazing?Good-bye.Heya, Benedict... How's the other fight going?Did I have a hand in what?You get robbed or something, Benedict? Geez, that's a shame.What would you say if I told you you could get your money back... ... if you gave up Tess? What would you say?Well, that's very interesting... ... but I didn't have anything to do with it.I knew what I was doing.Three to six months, I should think.Thirteen million and you drive that piece of shit cross country to pick me up?Your eyes got closer together. How's life?To a phone.My what?I'm not sure these belong to me.We need to find Rusty a girl.You said you sold this.Liar.", "clean_line": "good morning daniel ocean ma charged wife left upset got self

"Bernie?Alright. Who's here?That's a problem.I thought they let him out to do that H.B.O. thing in Vancouver.Not the one from --I quit watching when Kate left Don after his accident.Good evening, guys. Let's play some cards...... and let's play some cards.Why you bet a certain way is your business. But you have to make them think you're betting for a reason. Understand?Seth. You know what you have. Looking at them doesn't change them. Leave 'em where they are and make your bet.You're showing. Yeah, I know she's your girlfriend, Barry, but you can't... Thank you.Josh. Deal to your left.You got me. Let's take a little break.It's been the longest hour of my life.I'm running away with your wife.What's this?What was his name, the bouncer's?A card player with amnesia. This should be fun.Barry, you're showing again.Incan matrimonial headmasks.Don't let him fool you, Seth. There's boatloads. If you can move the things... One card to me. ... but you can't.If you're dealing with cash, you don't need a fence.Probably everybody in cell block E.I should hope so.Guys: Day One: what's the first rule of poker?That's right. My friend here just raised me out of pique. Today's lesson. How to draw out a bluff. This early in the game, that much money, I'm thinking he's holding nothing better than a pair of face cards. Seth, raise him.Tophe...Indeed. But be careful you don't push him too high too fast. Want to keep him on the leash. I call.All you have to do is call.Guys, you're free to do what you like. It's a lot of money. But I'm staying in. He's trying to buy his way out of his bluff.We call.Shit. Sorry, guys. I -- I was sure he was bluffing.That was, that was just...How was the clink? You get the cookies I sent you?You barge into my new workplace, ruin my professional reputation, least you could do is tell me you've got something better for me.How's Tess?Alright. Tell me.Guns?What's the target?What's. The. Target.What? You wanna knock over a casino?If I'm reading these right -- and I think that I am -- this is probably the least accessible vault ever designed. Oops. Actually, you know what, I'm wrong. It's definitely the least accessible vault ever designed.You said three casinos...The Bellagio, Mirage, and... These are Terry Benedict's places.More than somewhat.You'd need at least a dozen guys, doing a combination of cons.Well, off the top of my head, I'd say you're looking at a Boesky, a Jim Brown, a Miss Daisy, two Jethros, and a Leon Spinks. Oh, and the biggest Ella Fitzgerald ever. Where do you think you're gonna get the money to back this?But does he have enemies with loose cash and nothing to lose... Aha.Reuben.So, here's what I think: You should take this plan, kick it around for a week or two. Sleep on it. Turn it over in your head. Then: never bring it up to me again.I'm saying: this is like trying to build a house of cards on the deck of a speeding boat.I need a reason. And don't say money. Why do this?You're been practicing that speech, haven't you?No, it was good.I wonder what Reuben will say?You're right. He's right.That's exactly it. Pure ego.I'd never been to Belize.Say, you know, he's right.What are we doing, Reuben?Alright. Who's in?I talked to the Malloys yesterday.They're both in Salt Lake City, six months off the job. I got the sense they're having trouble filling the hours.Livingston Dell.Livingston's been doing freelance surveillance work of late for the F.B.I. Mob Squad.Okay. Not so bad you'd notice.Munitions.Dead.Sun cancer.Dated his wife a while.We may be too late.Isn't that right, Basher?Peck, A.T.F. Let me venture a guess. A simple G4 mainliner, double-coil, backwound, quick fuse with a drag under 20 feet. That's our man. Tell me something else. Have you checked him for booby traps on his person? I mean really checked, not just for weapons...Will you go find Griggs and tell him I need to see him?Just go find him, will you? How fast can you put something together with what I passed you?From when?Ten seconds?Around the corner.Everyone down! Get down! There's a bomb in the...More than that.He is the list.Watch.There's your grease man.He won't come. He swore off the game a year ago.Ulcers.I can ask.How ya been, Saul?What's with the orange?So why don't you take vitamins?I got a box seat. Come on.I thought you drank bloody Mary's at the track, Saul.Who we rooting for here?Saul, you're the best there is. You're in Cooperstown. What do you want?Guys like us don't change, Saul. We stay sharp or we get sloppy, but we don't change.That your hound way in the back there?It's a little more complicated than that.-- here, here, and here ---- which we can't fake ---- which we won't get.-- meaning if we manually override the lift, the shaft's exit will lock down automatically and we'll be trapped.No. Tunneling is out. There are Richter scales monitoring the ground for one hundred yards in every direction. If a groundhog tried to nest there, they'd know about it. Anyone else?That's what I said.Without being seen by the cameras.Two. And one of them is lonely.Thanks, Charmaine. I'll have it back within the hour. Say hello to your mom for me.They say taupe is very soothing.Yeah...For practice.Reverse that.Okay. Tell me about Benedict.What do they talk about?And that portfolio contains the codes to all the cage doors?-- his brother-in-law's tractor dealership, I heard.You scared?Only in the morning. Now what?Where's she come from?Tess.Her name is Tess.But what doesn't beat the shit out of being a circus performer?Tell me this isn't about her. Or I'll walk off the job right now. Tess. She's with Terry Benedict now. Tell me this isn't about screwing the guy who's screwing your wife.Tell me.Here's the problem: we're stealing two things now. And when push comes to shove, if you can't have both, which are you gonna choose? And remember: Tess doesn't divide eleven ways.I've seen her happier.Saturday day is yours. Do whatever you like with it.Call is at five-thirty. Makeup and costume. Saul's package arrives at seven-fifteen, and Linus grabs our codes. All goes well there and we're a go. Seven- thirty Virgil and Turk deliver Yen and we're committed. From that point, we have thirty minutes to blow the power or he suffocates.Once the electricity goes, all entry points to the vault and its elevator will automatically lock down for two minutes. That's when we make our move...Okay: they've put you in the middle of the room, far from everything. You have to get from here to the door without touching the floor. What do you do?We could --For how long?You boys have a nice trip?Saul: time to get out.Now!You have any idea how this happened?I did. I knew you couldn't leave Tess alone.Ex-wife.I'm sorry. I didn't know if it would sting you, but it did. You're out, Danny.It's that or we shut down right now. His involvement puts us all at risk.You made it my call. When you put her ahead of us. You made it mine.Not anymore.Kid, you up for it?Find everyone else. Let 'em know the change in plan. Curtain goes up at seven.Where you gonna put your hands?No...Not the pockets, either. And don't touch your tie. Look at me...That how you gonna stand?Wrong again. I ask you a question, you have to think of the answer, where you gonna look?Death. You look down, they know you're lying ---- and up they know you don't know the truth. Don't use three words when one will do, don't shift your eyes, look always at your mark but don't stare, be specific but not memorable, funny but don't make him laugh, he's gotta like you then forget you the moment you've left his sight, and for God's sakes whatever you do, don't under any circumstances --Sure thing.You ready?Linus... you're up.Okay: when do you make the deposit?Amazing: how's it feel? You alright? Want something to read? Magazine?Okay. I'm counting down. Thirty minutes of breathing time starts... now.Did you make it out?He's got it. Virgil, Turk: deliver your package.That's my cue. Give Basher the go.Someone called for a doctor?Hell, I think Reuben bought it, and he knew we were screwing around. You sure about this?He's gone.Livingston, we're set.May I have a word with Mr. Benedict, please?The man who's robbing you.You're watching your monitor? Okay, keep watching.In this town, your luck can change just that quickly.Maybe.No. You're gonna carry it out for us.Take a closer look at your monitor...As your manager's probably reporting to you by now, you have a little over a hundred sixty million in your vault tonight.You may notice: we're only packing up about half that. The other half we're leaving in your vault, booby-trapped, as a hostage.You let our eighty million go, and you get to keep your eighty. That's the deal. You try and stop us, we'll blow both cash loads.Mr. Benedict: you can lose eighty million dollars secretly tonight or you can lose a hundred sixty million dollars publicly. It's your decision.Hi.He's fine. He wants you to go upstairs, and watch TV.It's alright, Tess. I promise. Good. Here's what you do. Five minutes from now, the men in the vault are going to deposit six bags in the vault elevator.If they meet anyone, we'll blow the money in the bags and the money in the vault.One minute after that, the elevator will rise to your cages. Six of your guards will pick up the bags and carry them out into the casino.If they take more than twenty seconds to reach the casino floor or if there's any indication a switch has been made, we'll blow the money in the vault and the money in the bags.Of course, I'm in the casino. In fact, I'm staying in your hotel. And I have two words for you: mini-bar. Now as soon as your guards hit the casino floor...... a white unmarked van is going to pull up in your valet station.Your guards will load the bags into the van's rear. If anyone so much as approaches the driver's door, we blow everything.Now, when I get word that the van hasn't been followed, that the money is secure, my men will exit the building, and once their safety is confirmed, you'll get your vault back.I would.Yes?Prepare to cut power!Las Vegas P.D. This is Officer Brooks, New Jersey Probation Division. I have a violator in your jurisdiction... Hit it.Looking for someone?Hello to you, too.Your hair's grayer.Life... is a roomful of pillows.

I had to iron out a few issues with my fight promoter. I gave him an unlimited budget, and he exceeded it.We hope.Magnificent! I've been following her for fifteen years now. At last I've made her a home. All the arrangements and so forth...Not mine. She belongs to everyone who comes into my hotel. Isn't that right, Ms. Ocean?She's lovely, isn't she? I can't be the only one who was after her.Ah, but this... You can't put a price on beauty. But I shouldn't philosophize. I own casinos, after all.Of course, of course.I like that you like it. I have some bad news from the world of high fashion. It seems Mike Tyson will be wearing red on Saturday night. Red trunks with a white stripe.And you, as I recall, will be wearing a red Donna Karan? And when the TV cameras pick us up in the front row, that red dress...He's a charming man, but no one's going to be watching him when they can make a study of you. I've asked Paolo to find three or four things for you to try. I hope you're not too disappointed.Are you sure?I'll see you tonight.In my hotels, there's always someone watching.Actually, I do like it.Eddie. Anything for me?Who is he?Zerga? Never heard of him.He's staying here?How's he doing?Good for him...Mr. Weintraub. How's everything?And here I thought you were drinking vodka. Mr. Zerga.You're the guest, sir.I'd love to, Mr. Zerga, but the gaming board would feed me to my white tigers.No shame at all. Reminds me of my youth.Yes. I can get you seats...I'd be happy to put it in the house safe for you.I can assure you, the house safe is utterly...What are you doing?Mr. Ocean. Forgive me for being late. A guest required my attention.Is that right?'Of all the gin joints in all the world...' You've been in prison until recently, isn't that right? How does it feel to be out?There's the human condition for you.Stay for a drink, if you like.Well, then I don't imagine we'll be seeing you again, Mr. Ocean.I know everything that happens in my hotels.The towels you can keep.Don't be.Good to see you.I hope there's as much dynamite in the Paradiso as there will be in this Saturday's fight.Yes. Yes. No. Very much no. Then inform Mr. Levin he'll find a better view of the fight in front of his television. Surely he must have H.B.O.What are you thinking about?Any sign of Ocean?Put a guy on him. He's here for a reason. I'd like to know what it is. But if he comes anywhere near Tess, take it to the next level.Mr. Zerga. It's a very busy night for me. Are we on schedule?It's a nice evening. Shall we wait outside?Find Mr. Walsh. Tell him Mr. Ocean's in the west slots.I'm afraid I can't allow my private security personnel inside the casino cages. I hope you don't mind...They're very beautiful. A gift.Can you lift them out, please?Alright, Mr. Zerga. I acknowledge that the case does not contain any dangerous or illicit material. I further agree to take custody of your case for a twenty-four hour period to store in our secured vault. While I cannot permit you to accompany the case to the vault...Insurance, for one. Security, another. And I don't trust you.Mr. Zerga, this is Mr. Walsh, my casino manager. If you will allow, he will arrange for your briefcase to be stored inside our vault while you watch on a security monitor. Those are my terms. Yes or no?Mr. Zerga...Yes?Of course. Anything for the N.G.C.If he is who you say he is. Charlie. Call over Ramon Escalante.You new at the commission?I know Hal Lindley over there. You work with him at all?Mr. Escalante. Would you come with us, please?I think it's better if we talked off the floor.You alright?Please show this man off the premises. Don't step foot in my casino again.Mr. Wills, if you don't mind... Mr. Wills?You know how to get back out?Thank you.What the hell was that?The first goddamn round.You gonna answer it?See who's on the other end.Who the hell is this?What the hell is going on down there in the vault?Show me.I'm afraid you're mistaken.Jesus Christ...Find out how much money we have down there.Alright. You've proved your point. You've broken into my vault. Congratulations: you're a dead man.May I ask: how do you expect to leave here, hmm?Do you believe I'll simply allow you to parade bags full of my money out my casino doors?And why would I do that?Make the call.Okay. You have a deal.You have a deal.He's in the casino right now.Now what?Sir, I have complied with your every request, would you agree?Good. Now I have one of my own.Run and hide. If you get picked up next week buying a $100,000 sports car in Newport Beach, I'll be supremely disappointed. Because I want my people to find you. And rest assured: when they do, they won't hand you over to the police. Run and hide. That's all I ask.Get everyone in position. I want my vault back before that van hits the tarmac.Where's Zerga? Mr. Zerga? With the briefcase?Do it.What's the situation down there?Tell them to take the van. I'm going down there. Find out how they fiddled with our cameras.Yes.Take your men out now.Walsh: How are we with the van?Yes?And?Shit.What, Walsh?What?!What do you mean there was no money in the bags?Walsh, cue up the tape of the robbery.Does it say 'Bellagio' on the south wall of the vault?We had that installed on Tuesday. The image we saw of the men robbing us was a tape.Someone built a double of my vault, then made a tape of them robbing it. When we saw them putting money in those bags, that wasn't actually happening.Ocean...Where's Ocean?Open that door.Wake him up.Did you have a hand in this? Did you?Get him out of here.Stop there.Where. Is. My. Money.I would say yes.Escort Mr. Ocean to the exit. And contact the police. I would imagine Mr. Ocean is in violation of his parole.No. Follow him. Everywhere.Tess...
