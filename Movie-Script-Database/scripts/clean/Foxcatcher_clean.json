{"Foxcatcher": {"MARK": {"raw_line": "Why do I do it? Why do I push myself to my limits - of pain, of exhaustion - every day of my life? Why do I wake up every morning and make the commitment? Why do I do it?In 13 months - if I train right, if I push myself - I'll be going to Seoul - that's a city in South Korea. Does anyone know why? Because that's where the Olympic games are.Does anyone know what this is?Olympic gold medal. I won it three years ago at the `84 Games in Los Angeles. My brother, Dave Schultz - my best friend, my older brother, my best friend - won one too, just 23 hours and 16 minutes before I did. That's unprecedented - two brothers winning at the same Olympics. Would you like me to win another one? Would you like me to win another gold medal - for us, for America? Would you like to see me and my big brother - Dave Schultz - both win gold medals? Who here wants to see the two brothers win again?Well we're going to give it absolutely everything we've got.And this is for the trophy case.For the trophy case. With the trophies.I'll have a # 4.No. Can I get extra meat on that?What are you talking about?Where's it say that?I always get extra meat. Every time I come here.Coach Teller? This is Mark Schultz--I won a freestyle wrestling gold medal at the `84 Olympics.I'm arranging a clinic in your area next weekend, and I wanted to invite you and some of your wrestlers to join...That's Dave, my brother. I wrestle at 180... No, he won't be there, just me... Okay - well, good luck with your season, coach.Yes, there's a small fee.S-C-H-U-L-T-Z....A unique, character-building opportunity for young wrestlers.... Yes, a small fee...Dave's my brother...Olympic Champion...Dave's my brother...Talked to some coaches.Why?I'll check.You said Saturday or Sunday?Saturday could work.Seoul's the goal.The minute you step on the mat, you are exactly who you are. You can't hide. You can't pretend you trained harder than you did, you want it more than you do. My brother Dave and me care about this more than we care about anything. The difference between the number one guy in the world and the number four guy is paper thin. The one who wins is the one who wants it more, who's willing to sacrifice, who can take the pain. I can take the pain. My brother Dave can take the pain. Can you take the pain?I talk about all this in my instructional videotape - which you can purchase at the end of the day for a nominal fee.You been calling me and hanging up?Sorry about your nose.You win a gold medal for them. And still. Nothing. No respect.Yah.It's Mark.Okay...Who do you work for again?What does he want to talk about?Uh-huh.Oh. Yes, sir.They said it was the library.Mark Sch --Thank you, sir. I'm proud of that day.To be perfectly honest, we don't often talk.Yes sir, it is.Oh. Well. I take the mornings on my own - as you said, strength training, endurance - then I meet up with my brother - you know Dave Schultz - ?- I meet up with him at the U-W gym, we work out whatever free time we can grab between team practice.Yes sir.Pretty much.- Thank you -It's the world championship.I want to be the best in the world.I started kind of late - high school sophomore.I was... well, truthfully, I was... kind of lost. And I got into it `cause my brother was wrestling. He convinced me to give it a try. I never told him this, but I was scared of losing in front of him. So of course my first match I get put up against a kid two years older. Dave was helping coach from my corner... and at the end, when the ref raised my hand...there was my brother, he was running towards me - screaming - laughing - he lifted me up --It's always been his sport. He let me inside. I'm just lucky to be very very good at it.25 thousand a year. He said name your price and I said the highest price that came into my head. We'd get to hand-pick our own team, wrestlers we want to work with -No - I mean... when I say we, I mean - you and me... could choose a team. Together.As soon as you meet him you'll understand. He sees what we're after. He cares about America - old family, basically paid for the Revolutionary War - he gets it. He wants to help us win, help restore our pride.No, not.... This country's pride.Dave - this is it. This is what we've wanted our whole lives - just to train - you and me - not to have to deal with USA Wrestling, or Harper and his corrupt university program - not to have to think about anybody else...I'm speaking to my brother, that okay with you?Why does she...The deer hunting on his farm's supposed to be amazing...The Worlds are sixty days away.Du Pont's taking his money out of the Villanova program. They'll pull the plug on that. So. Dan Bane could come. I - I guess Dan Bane. I don't know how to do this without you.Does it?Do you? A spot's always open for you if you decide to come.Hi. I'm Mark Schultz.I'm here to see John du Pont?Yeah. Well - not today exactly, but, yes. This week. Sometime.In the meantime can I use the -Is he? He's in there?Thanks.Yes.That's right.Sounds okay.That could be a good policy.Yes.Of course.I've actually got suggestions for about half the roster.I've been making phone calls.Twenty-seven.Oklahoma University.Yes.Yes.No.No.Two.No.Mr. du Pont.Yes sir, I drove straight down.Great.All right. Thank you, sir.No.I didn't realize he was married.Has he always lived with his mother?Mr. du Pont, I want to thank you FOR -You wrote this?Thank you. Do you want to come in?- The fridge is full - you probably know better than me what's in there-Not even. 54 days.Drop!DROP -Sir, you need me for something?Pair up. On the mat. Up and down. Popper, Springer, let's go.Go!No, thank you. I'm good.Gecko? Great wrestler. What do you want to know?Anti-what?I will.How do you mean?Right. Look. Dave's... he's got a good situation going up in Madison. He's... he doesn't want to uproot. The family. Just at the moment. At the present time.Mr. du Pont, I don't... you can't buy Dave.I wasn't... I didn't realize you wanted him to coach.Right to left.I'm pretty sure that's John's mother.Dave.Dave.Come meet Mr. du Pont.I told him how excited you were to meet him.What?Dave, check out the tape I have on NANEV -I want to show you this downblock -Too difficult to come say hello to Mr. du Pont?It's John du Pont. One of the most generous men in America. He's gonna save USA Wrestling. Can you not do that in here?Smoking.I wrestle tomorrow.I'm trying to get advice from my brother, get ready for the finals -You start smoking - ?- Your kids are in here -What the hell is that?I'm not the one frigging smoking.I don't want to let you down.You don't have to do this.Thank you, Coach.Yes. Yes, I did. I... It's not gonna happen. He got offered a contract extension at Wisconsin, Team USA wants him to train Olympic wrestlers next summer, he - it's not gonna happen.Of course I -I do -Do you think that's true? Because... all these years -If that's what -Uh - well - not all that much -Okay...You good with this?Kneeled now? On the floor. Really? It won't look...Read it?John Eagle du Pont, highly respected ornithologist, author, world explorer, phil... phila...... highly respected ornithologist, author, world explorer, phil... phila...Stamp collector, and former pentathlete.Mr. Du Pont will be making his return to competitive sports in the over-50 category at the Masters' League du Pont Wrestling Invitational in Phoenix, Arizona this March.I'm so proud to introduce my mentor. He has the ability to look at me and see where I am in life. He knows how to motivate me. I feel his love for me as an athlete and as a human being. My mother and father were divorced when I was two years old. I spent a lifetime looking for a father...and I found one in the Golden, uh... the Gold Eagle of America - John du Pont.Ready? Go.Okay. Let's try it again.Yeah. I'm good. Yeah.... All good.Yeah. No, I'm kind of giving myself a bit of a break right now. I'll ramp it up again as the trials come closer.Just a sec...No, I wasn't - listen, I gotta run -I just - I gotta run.I will -- Yeah, well -- I will. I gotta roll -Looking good. Looking tough.I think you're ready. We just need some more talc.Yah! I think you're ready.You've done the training, you learned the moves. You're ready to rumble, boss.It's nothing.We all have demons.When Dave's son, Alex, was born he had some problems with his lungs. It looked like he wasn't gonna live. I was sitting in the hospital waiting room, and all I could think was: Maybe it's better if he dies. Dave won't be distracted. We can get back to training together. Alex is fine now and, you know, he's my nephew. I'm not proud I wanted him to die, but it's the truth. That's just the truth. You gotta conquer your demons.Yeahhhhh!!!!When he gives you the slightest opening, you gotta shoot in on him. Be aggressive. Show him who's boss.Hi, Boss. How you doing? Any soreness from the match?Yeah, no, exactly - we've got an intense workout scheduled this afternoon. Real intense one. So we're taking the morning to rest up.Well, I mean, I am.On what?John, seriously, I don't know how else to say it. It's not gonna happen. You can't buy Dave. It's just not gonna happen.Hello?... Hello?I need to see John.Stan, please. I need to see him.Listen - I - something happened. There was a - misunderstanding. I think I did something wrong and I really need to talk to him about it-Oh, uh -Yeah, of course. Just... just give me a minute.Hey, Dave.Good. I'm good.Yeah. I'm just concentrating. Trials are in 50 days.How they doing?I will. I will.Please don't do that.- Please. I'm asking you to not...Need to study up. Fix some weakness.Pretty much.Nothing's going on. What does that mean?The fuck you talking about?I don't know what you're talking about.I'm done.It's over. I'm done. You lost. I lost. It's over.Tomorrow morning?7 O'CLOCK -I'll pick you up tomorrow, 7am.Wait - your house, right?What's going on?What -?Were you in the Big House yesterday?In the afternoon? Because I got turned away when I came within fifty yards of the house. What were you doing there?About what?He's weakening me.I talked to Bachman at SMU last night. He says they're expanding the program. There'll be room for both of us in the fall -- I told him we could all get on the phone next weekend -- SMU's gonna make a move, they're gonna take a run at it - we can be there at the beginning -- I can't do this anymore. I can't do it -- John's killing me here -- If we at least let Bachman know by the end of the week we'll have a place to go to after -You're not thinking of staying here...?My own life.And you'll be here.What's on your forehead?It says kids.What does that mean?

study.It is.John du Pont.- I know who you are - I've watched your Olympic victory enough times to know exactly who you are, every inch of you. Please, put your bag down, make yourself comfortable, sit, make yourself at home -I watched the video of your Olympic run again last night. After you broke the arm of the Turk - after they disqualified you, handed you a loss - after they put an extra official on you to watch your holds - all of which were legal - after all that you rack up seven straight wins to take the medal. For your country. Thrilling. Thrilling. Inspiring. Take the gold medal.You should be. I'm proud of that day. I'm proud of you on that day. Your parents must be enormously proud.I want to tell you how much I appreciate your coming here. I know it cuts into your training. I imagine that's every day for you?Strength training in the morning? Upper body regimen - muscle tone - building up the muscle tone - across the upper body. In the morning?Of course, of course, yes, I know him. I mean, not personally, but yes, of course, I do know him.University of Wisconsin.Where you both coach.And they provide you with everything you need?I'd like to see you win this upcoming tournament -- I'd like to help you win this upcoming tournament. It's a big one, yes?Why do you do it, Mark?Why?I want you to be the best in the world. I want this country to be the best in the world. May I speak frankly?I'm concerned. I'm concerned by what I see in these Unites States. Athletes labor to bring honor to America, and America fails to honor that labor. Fails to honor it and fails to support it.When did you win your first match?You won that match. Not him.The U.S. Olympic Committee refuses to recognize that training for international competition is a full time job. Why is that? Why is that? I want you all to have a home.I wish every American could come here and see for themselves. See the price of freedom. It's not free at all.The sacrifices of the troops that first long winter remind me of what you athletes go through.I'm gratified my family could play a small part in the history here.We can't choose the family we're born to. But we can make our own. I can't think of anyone I'd rather build a team with. You name your price.Ah. Hello. You've arrived.They're setting him up in the chalet?Excellent bed. Firm mattress. Good for the lower back.All right.You hear that?Barred owl -When you spot one, you'll see with each hoot there's a white flash in his collar. His throat swells, and he reveals to you the lighter feathers he keeps hidden underneath.It's from ten years ago, but I thought you might find it interesting.I did.No no -- No. You need your rest. You need to get started bright and early.- I had a wonderful night a few years back when I spotted all eight Northeast species. Right here on the farm. What do we have - two months to the Worlds?54 days. We'll get it done.Dan Bane. How's that hamstring?Good. Good to hear. Hamstring coming back.No no. Later. Please. Continue.Good. Good.I can't get you anything at all?In training. Excellent.Talk to me about Roberto Garcia.Just a sense. Keep your eye on him. Let me know of anything suspicious. Subversive. Anti.Anything at all. Phone calls. Anything.You see the artistry, the care, the craftsmanship that went into making this great American symbol? You see the face hidden among the feathers? Right here.We need to exert the same care in crafting a world-class wrestling experience here at Foxcatcher. How're we doing with Dave Schultz?You were going to speak to him again. When's he coming?He is a world class competitor - a world class coach. We are building a world class team. He belongs here. Tell me what I have to offer him.Wrestle and coach. We all coach each other. Support each other.Let me ask your opinion -What do you think? Right to left, or left to right?John du Pont. It's a pleasure to meet you in person finally.Hello.No no.Thank you. No. I need to be getting back. But, don't worry - we'll make a Foxcatcher out of you yet. Until tomorrow.I think you're up.Mark. Dave just won. It's your turn.I can't.... I've watched you these past months... I can't imagine being let down by you.Let's clear it out!Oh, yes!Mother's idea of sport is riding a horse that's chasing a dog that's chasing a fox. I don't share her affection for horseflesh -Put `em up, boys!You've brought honor to Team Foxcatcher.You've brought honor to -More drinks!days to Seoul, gentlemen. days. Let's get to work.Come talk to me.America doesn't respect you. Doesn't place any value on you at all. I reward accomplishment.Please. Call me John. Or Coach. Whichever you prefer. Maybe Eagle. Or Coach. Eagle is good. How're we doing with Dave?You spoke to him again at the Worlds.Do you believe in this team?- Do you believe we deserve this country's best talent?- I pay for results not only on the mat, but in recruiting the best of the best to Foxcatcher Farms. That's part of your job.It's probably best. Dave intimidates you. You don't believe you can ever do better than your brother. Glass ceiling. Impossible for you to break through.- Well. You're the public face of Foxcatcher.- What do you know about Masters League wrestling tournaments?- Because I'm thinking of entering one.- and the gold medal -It's wonderful. It's exactly what I needed from you.I think you were below me by a couple of steps when you hugged me at the Worlds.Maybe if you kneeled.No. No. You should kneel.I think you were crying.Brandon and I prepared some remarks.Don't be nervous. You'll do great.What? You've never done this? It helps put everything in perspective. Trust me.... Mark. It's just cocaine. Trust me.Nice. You brought the medals? Good. Try the speech.Read the speech.Philatelist.That's the one! That's the one I need!What I need is the gun turret. Don't send me one without that MK- 19 mounted on top.Philatelist.Philatelist.Mark Schultz. Thank you, son. (waves to Jean inI appreciate this...No. Mark. I appreciate this.When I was fourteen - my father had left us long before that - my best friend was Clifford Holt, our gardener's son. Then I found out Mother had been paying Cliff to be friends with me.It's good to know you and I have come to this... friendship without any of that nonsense. Financial nonsense.Conquer demons.They're dead.I've rearranged some of the horse ribbons, Mother...... Some of the older prizes in the trophy case.To make room for Team Foxcatcher medals.... For the wrestling awards.Including this, Mother. Ha. Which I've actually just won.I'm sorry?Just some of the older ones. From the case. From the Rosemont case.I went by the gym - it's almost noon - and there's no one in there. There is no one in there. In the gym.Who precisely is in charge around here?Where do we stand on Dave?David Schultz. Your brother. When is he coming to Foxcatcher?We need someone to take charge around here, someone to lead.New moves. Wrestling moves. Need to try them out.In the gym.No mercy!Keep it up, gentlemen.Your brother's taking the reins. Leading.You've got more in you than that.You've got to dig deep. Find out what's inside. Discover what you're made of.Conquer your demons, Mark. CONQUER -He was talking to you about something and you seemed pretty upset. What was he saying to you?David Schultz. Dave.I'd like to show you something. Why don't you hop in?- Need to show you something. At the battlefield. Come. Sit. Come.Family time. Ah. Very good.Good. Good family time.And.... break! Gentlemen, well done! Listen up. Team. Listen up.A number of you will be travelling with me to the Olympic Trials in Pensacola next week. From the moment you leave these hallowed training grounds, you will be in competition. There's no lying in a fight. Who you think you are in the moments leading up to a fight, and who you are when the fight begins - the truth will become abundantly clear.Raul Garcia, come up here for a moment.Raul. Gecko. Come.Muchas gracias, compadre. Por favor.The period begins before the whistle blows, when the other wrestler feels you above him, feels your purpose.Then... the whistle blows!Need to get after him, there. Low low low.Next time, Mark. A good effort.Here you are. I've been looking all over for you --No no. All's fine. There's work to be done. Back to work, gentlemen.If you and I can't get him there, no one can. We're in this together.Our challenge... as coaches... as leaders. I have coached... and psychologically prepare... Our Mark Schultz. To capture Olympic Gold......I wear many hats. I am leader. Mentor. Father figure. Brother. Older brother. At times the younger...It will not be easy. We have built... our family. Our obligation... is to build... winners... In life. To teach the secret... To build men who will... think of... Who will understand... the character traits... We must teach them... whether they will listen or no.Yes. Very sad. Very sad days here. Here at the farm.And gym bags.Where's the grenade launcher?The 40mm grenade launcher that's supposed to be mounted up here.- It goes right here. Right here.So where is it?From the under hook, pivot sideways while pulling down on his arm. Kneel between his legs and take him to the mat.Our challenge... as coaches... as leaders. I have coached... and psychologically prepare... our Mark Schultz... to capture Olympic Gold. I wear many hats. I am leader. Mentor. Father figure. Brother.Good.Excellent.Northern Cardinal.
