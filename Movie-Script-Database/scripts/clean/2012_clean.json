{"2012": {"ADRIAN": {"raw_line": "I still can't believe that Wilson chose him of all people to run the White House.Shame he's such a pompous ass.Yes sir... No, sir.We were talking about what a great speech you gave tonight. Well done, sir.Professor West?Sir, the President needs to know this.Four months this week.If this is about what I said last night, I am truly sorry, sir.Can you please have a look at this, sir? It's really important.An Indian astrophysicist I graduated with from Harvard and Prof. West, the preeminent geologist in the US.No one, sir.I'll be with you in a second, Professor.We're geologists...I'll handle this officer. Thank you.That's what we're trying to find out. We think this whole area has become potentially unstable. I would advise you to take your kids and leave, Mr...... Curtis.Are you by any chance the Jackson Curtis, the author of `Farewell Atlantis'?What a coincidence. I'm reading your book, as we speak... first third, around day 300, when the shuttle loses communication with earth and drifts off into space.Actually I didn't buy it. My father gave it to me.Officer, can you return them to the campgrounds, please. Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Curtis.... You have to immediately inform the President, Mr Anheuser. The readings look much worse than I expected.Plus Satnam's neutrino figures from India confirm...We were wrong! By five or six months...I'll make this brief...... According to our latest data from Yellowstone, the temperature of the subterranean crust of the earth, the cement that holds our landmass in place, is increasing at a rapid rate, much faster than anticipated...... This causes extreme polar instability. The magnetic fields have decreased by more than 80% over the last 48 hours.Two, maybe three days if we're lucky.Dad... what I have to tell you is very serious...You remember when I told you about the dam in China? Well, it's happening much sooner than we anticipated.The President has ordered us to clear out the White House.Where are you, dad? What exactly is the course of the `Freedom' right now?...I love you, dad.Have you seen this?Any news from Yellowstone?Just a few minutes ago Yellowstone erupted, sir. The ash cloud will reach Washington in roughly 7 hours. Maybe 6. We have strong easterly winds...No one knows, sir.He's praying sir. Which considering the circumstances is not a bad idea.Mr. President? We need to get you out of Washington immediately.That's not your fault sir.A little.There would have been chaos, sir.But sir?Where's Anheuser?The President is not coming. I couldn't convince him to.What about the Speaker of the House?But she's Commander In Chief now. Sir, I just think -He wanted to stay with his people.Can I come in?But I do...Your Dad and I... we were trying to protect you.But you were doing a good job.You know what your father believed. That nature will choose itself from itself.That's not true.What would you say were the chances of a first time, middle-aged writer, who barely sold 500 copies of his novel making it on board this plane?It's called `Farewell Atlantis' and it's a fantastic read. It's part of our legacy now.What if I tried to sort some of this mess out? I need to know you can forgive me...One more thing. Your father told me you were the most precious thing to him in the whole world... You are to me too.Do we have any news from the Japanese seaboard?We expect enormous tsunamis to reach landfall in every continent. The Cho Ming area will be impacted in approximately six hours.... and it looks like the crust has shifted by nearly 23 degrees in a south- westerly direction. Here's the computer simulation.Our data also shows, that our earth's poles have reversed their magnetic fields... ... These are their new positions.It's the south pole, sir.Satnam? Where are you?What?!Satnam, what happened?Do we have the latest satellite images of Napam, India?Looks like our model was wrong.Satnam was talking about a wave from the East.The flooding will happen earlier. Bobby, can you plug in the new data please?Satnam didn't get picked up.This one is at least 1500 meters high!Bobby, plug in the new data and adjust the count down?Anheuser convinced them all to launch.Anheuser! We have to stop this madness.Bobby, make sure the other bridges can hear this.I know exactly what I'm doing. Turn it on!This is Adrian Helmsley, science advisor to President Wilson...I know we've all been involved in making difficult decisions... to save our human civilization...... But to be human means to care for each other, and civilization means to work together to create a better life. If that's true there is nothing human and nothing civilized about what we're doing here. Ask yourselves ... Can we really stand by and let all those people out there die?A civilization that allows that, does not deserve to survive. Or at least I don't want to be part of it.Don't do it!We have to open our gates and let these people in. All of them.There is a young astrophysicist from India who is the reason we are all here, trying to give mankind a second chance. He's the one who discovered it all, the one who connected the dots. We all owe him our lives.I just learned that he was killed with his family by a tsunami in eastern India. You know why?He died because we forgot to pick him up. I beg you... whatever our future holds don't let us start it with an act of cruelty. What will you tell your children... and their children?Captain Michaels, you heard them.Can you zoom in?I know those kids. Remember the book I told you about? Their father wrote it.Captain, over here.I think we found the problem.How did they get in there?Let's get an emergency crew there right now. I'll meet them at the Hydraulic Chamber.What are you all waiting for?There's no way to override it?Then how will we get to the hydraulic chamber?Is there any way to talk to them?Mr. Curtis... I'm Adrian Helmsley. We met once before. Your daughter is with me.We can't get to you. Whatever you did, jammed the hydraulics. If you can't get it out... None of us will make it.You're our only hope.Captain Michaels - close the gate!... Day 988. No one is waiting for anything to happen...... and all we can hear is the sound of our own breathing that reminds us we are still sharing our memories, hopes and ideas.... And funny, just today we found out that the entire crew of the Atlantis, somehow or another, has relatives in Wisconsin. The end.Less than 500. It's what you might call a cult classic.Well that's healthy Dr. Wilson. Something we could maybe explore... unless you have other pressing engagements.You called for me, sir?This is Helmsley.Dad!... Is that you?Dad. We're coming to pick you guys up. How's Tony?See you guys soon. Bye dad.Pardon me?I finally finished your book Jackson.I'd say... those astronauts of yours would be shitting themselves, if they knew all their relatives are now stuck in the South Pole.", "clean_line": "believe wilson chose people run white house shame pompous ass yes sir sir talking great speech gave tonight sir professor west sir president needs know months week said night truly sorry sir look sir important indian astrophysicist graduated harvard prof west preeminent geologist sir ll second professor geologists ll handle officer thank trying think area potentially unstable advise kids leave mr curtis chance jackson curtis author farewell atlantis coincidence reading book speak day shuttle loses communication earth drifts space actually buy father gave officer return campgrounds pleasure meet mr curtis immediately inform president mr anheuser readings look worse expected plus satnam neutrino figures india confirm wrong months ll brief according latest data yellowstone temperature subterranean crust earth cement holds landmass place increasing rapid rate faster anticipated causes extreme polar instability magnetic fields decreased hours maybe days lucky dad tell remember told dam china happening sooner anticipated president ordered clear white house dad exactly course freedom right love dad seen news yellowstone minutes ago yellowstone erupted sir ash cloud reach washington roughly hours maybe strong easterly winds knows sir praying sir considering circumstances bad idea mr president need washington immediately fault sir little chaos sir sir anheuser president coming couldn convince speaker house commander chief sir think wanted stay people come dad trying protect good job know father believed nature choose true chances time middle aged writer barely sold copies novel making board plane called farewell atlantis fantastic read legacy tried sort mess need know forgive thing father told precious thing world news japanese seaboard expect enormous tsunamis reach landfall continent cho ming area impacted approximately hours looks like crust shifted nearly degrees south westerly direction simulation data shows earth poles reversed magnetic fields new positions south pole sir satnam satnam happened latest satellite images napam india looks like model wrong satnam talking wave east flooding happen earlier bobby plug new data satnam picked meters high bobby plug new data adjust count anheuser convinced launch anheuser stop madness bobby sure bridges hear know exactly turn adrian helmsley science advisor president wilson know ve involved making difficult decisions save human civilization human means care civilization means work create better life true human civilized ask stand let people die civilization allows deserve survive want open gates let people young astrophysicist india reason trying mankind second chance discovered connected dots owe lives learned killed family tsunami eastern india know died forgot pick beg future holds let start act cruelty tell children children captain michaels heard zoom know kids remember book told father wrote captain think problem let emergency crew right ll meet hydraulic chamber waiting way override hydraulic chamber way talk mr curtis adrian helmsley met daughter jammed hydraulics hope captain michaels close gate day waiting happen hear sound breathing reminds sharing memories hopes ideas funny today entire crew atlantis relatives wisconsin end cult classic healthy dr wilson maybe explore pressing engagements called sir helmsley dad dad coming pick guys tony guys soon bye dad pardon finally finished book jackson astronauts shitting knew relatives stuck south pole"}, "ANHEUSER": {"raw_line": "Somebody mention my name?Which one is it?It's Helmsley, right? I'll remember that.Helmsley, how long have you been on the job as science advisor?I would say that's enough time to learn that we have rules here. You'll just have to wait until the quarterly science briefing.So you didn't like my speech?Who wrote this?Who else knows about it?Let's keep it that way, Helmsley.... But you guys said...Sir, you have to initiate the boarding process immediately.They estimate four of the ships will be ready for launch.If it's alright with you sir, I'll brief the panel about the new development.Apologies Prime minster. He's still new to the job.And the crustal displacement?Let's get the government airborne and... I mean now.Where is the President, Sally?The whole North American continent is about to perish, and Wilson decides to go to church!Maybe. But right now I need the leader of the free world off his knees and on Air Force One. Wheels up 1900 hours. Can I leave that with you Helmsley?So, the captain doesn't want to leave his sinking ship? Well, Mr. Helmsley, we just learned that the Vice President's chopper crashed 80 miles north of Atlanta.In this chaos... I have no idea!I don't care what you think, Helmsley.Your ass only made it into the White House, because your old man knew the First Lady... and because of all that affirmative action bullshit.There was a white kid, much more qualified than you. Just so you know.There is a protocol for just this situation Ms. Wilson and I'm afraid we'll have to follow it to the letter.Tell the Captain, to take off immediately.That's affirmative, Mr. President. Until communication is restored, I am in command.... It seems all other Heads of State are en route, however there are unconfirmed reports that the Italian Prime Minister has also decided to stay behind and trust in prayer rather than action...Any clue what to expect next, Professor?At least some good news.Would our science advisor care to give us his assessment?So Helmsley, what you're telling us here is that... the north pole is now somewhere in Wisconsin?I've been told of damages?Dr. Wilson, there's a protocol for all that. You just stick to your art. We'll handle the rest.Captain? Where is the Bridge?Helmsley, what's going on here?What does this mean?Talk to me Helmsley. What does this mean for us?Get me the other Heads of State.What do you think you're doing?We'll miss you Helmsley but somehow we'll get by. Officer switch that off.That's an order soldier.Have you lost your mind? Look at the countdown. We have less than five minutes left... And none of our ships have the resources to feed those people. If you save them today we all starve tomorrow.Do you wanna be responsible for the extinction of the human race? Can you handle that, Adrian?!Do it!Why is the stern gate not closing?You're damn right something went wrong! Congratulations Helmsley, you may have just killed us all but as long as your conscience is clean...You think you're the main man now, just because your fucking the President's daughter?Captain, what's happening?Put that woman down Helmsley.Young guys like you with your idealistic dreams, you think you can change the world...I just pray to God, that you keep on making the right calls... in this new world of ours.Mr. Helmsley, one more thing.There was no one.There was no white kid better than you.
