I started livin' the day I found you, you know that?Serveza yourself!No, dammit, I would easy.You can play the piano, an' your whole damn family can play on some type a musical instrument. An' all I'm askin' is for you to listen to my singing for one single little second...But you think you would? No, you're too damn selfish...Out where?I'll go out with you, or I'll stay here, and do anything you'd like for me to do... if you'll just do one thing. If you'll tell me that you love me.You know what, you are never satisfied.Oh, now, baby...Is this suppose to be fun?The ball's too heavy for me, honey...I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.Id'n he somethin' to see?Is it my turn again?I can't help it, honey, the ball just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on me...I did, didn' I, El?That was damn good, wad'n it? I finally did it...I'm gonna go wait in the car.I'm not.Yes.I hope they do.You're the pathetic one, not me.I'm not some piece a crap.You treat me like I was.You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...You're goin' a find me dead one time.If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.Do you love me, Bobby?You son of a bitch.Give me a swig, hon'.Honey, took at this little bugger.Id'n he the cutest little guy?You'll be gone, period.\"There's been hot spells/An' cold spells ever since we met/I've seen your small fires/Your big fires/But I won't give up yet/Oh someday you'll yearn/'Cause your heart's gonna burn/For that old familiar glow/You'll be burned...\"You like it?\"You'll be burned out/Or smoked out/An' come back to me, I know...\"\"Every trail that you blaze/Makes me...\"Is it an accident?What'd she say?Jesus, what a rude person...An' what's your name?I'll tell you... ... l-a-t-e-r.There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...Well...That's an old maid's tale.Salesmen and cops are the ones. If you'd ever waitressed, honey, you'd know.Don't call me \"mack,\" honey.You better hold onto your tongue!Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that!Are you depressed about your daddy, honey?I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?You're depressed that I come along.Well, is that a happy face I see?'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.I don't know if I'm gonna be able to sleep or not.Hint, hint.I guess I'll just have to count the sheep. One-two-three-four...Seven... eight... Look at this old cold shoulder, what am I gonna do with it?Tick a lock.Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?Bobby, don't talk like that...It'll be all right, I'll get a hold a some magazines an' things like that. An' maybe find a beauty salon an' get my hair fixed, okay?Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?It brings out my eyes...Okay...Bye, baby...You certainly do have a beautiful piece a real estate out here, Mr. Dupea.Can he hear me?Well, that's a blessing, at least.This certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop. How could you have left such a beautiful place, Bobby?For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money... I didn't have no number to call, you know. So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.That certainly is a beautiful head a hair you have.Is it natural?What?Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?I do eat slow as a bird, whereas Bobby can put it away like a speed swing... Is there any ketchup around?It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.I guess Bobby's just about the moodiest man I ever ben with...Is there a TV in the house?There's some good things on it, though.The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.What kind of doggy is that?Oh, uh huh. I had a little kittycat once, that Bobby give me...Remember, Bobby?! The little pussycat you gave me?!She had four little white paws, an' oh, was I crazy over her. We hadda go an' leave her one time at some friends, an' she went out an' got smashed flatter'n a tortilla right outside their mobile home.Well, she was.Bobby...Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...I never got the chance to thank you all for your hospitality. You tell Carl for me, if any of you folks wanta come on down to our place anytime, you'd be more'n welcome...Bye bye, now.\"Your kiss is like a drink when I'm thirsty/An' I'm thirsty for you with all my heart...\"\"But don't love me/Then act as though we've never kissed/Oh, don't touch me...\"\"Don't touch me...\"\"Don't touch me...\"\"Don't touch me...\"\"Oh, don't touch...\"Son of a bitch, Bobby!

I just wish I had more time...A wig?Your little friend's real sharp there... Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it when I'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. I think it gives me a little more class, don't you?Yeah, you could say it's me.Well, you seem very professional...Yeah, I can see how she'd come in handy.Come on. We're goin' over to Elton's.You just going to sit there?Okay. Hope no one hits on you.See you later, then...No one would want to hit on you, you look too pathetic.Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time.I'm going on over there...I know you're not.I'm sorry.Now, hand...Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you. An' they're just goin' to think I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not, an' that you're a hell of a person puttin' up with me, that's all.Sssh, come on now... Be a good girl.I'm not going to get up an' leave you. Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.Well now, what do you think?Can you believe this shit?Goddamned freeway... Jesus Christ...Look at these assholes! What the hell are they doing?!I can't take this shit anymore.I was with Elton last night, Ray.It's the truth.Rayette...Very cute... Put it down, an' let's go.Yeah... An' I oughta live in a trailer park with my front teeth poked out...It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!Just keep telling me about the good life, Elton, if you want a see me puke my lunch!I hope that's all you gotta say, El, 'cause I'm about as tired of your mouth as I am workin' this stinkin' hole!Hey, Longcipher! I'm quitting!Longcipher! I'm talking to you!Did you hear me?! I said I'm quitting!Hey! What's goin' on?!Christ Almighty, what's happening here?Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!Would you tell her Bobby's here?Hi, Tita.Now don't...That's good.Don't, then.Well, I don't mean to. Here's your tea, Tita.Sorry.Oh.No.No kidding.Very nice.Everybody still up on the Island?Who's Van Oost?Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?Sprained his neck?Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck. That's Carl...What?Oh, well, what, what's he...Don't tell me about this...Yeah... I guess so...No...I'd rather drive up myself and... maybe go into Canada after... And I can't stay long, Tita, probably a week, at the most.Well... I better let you...Maybe you better stay, then.Well, I'll be seeing you in a couple of days, won't I?Yeah, me, too...Tita, I've got to go...Hello?!You have the day off?!Are you sick?You heard about Elton, I guess.Okay, I get your point.Hope you didn't strain yourself, getting in here and into your pose before I hit the door.I have to go home. My father's sick.Yeah, it's very funny.I'll be gone two or three weeks.I'll try and call you from up there.Come on, DiPesto. I never told you it would work out to anything. Did I?I'll send you some money, that's all I can do.And... I'll call you, like I said... Bye, Ray.Do you want to go with me, Ray?I love it.What the hell is that?Hey! What's going on, what's the trouble?!You're lucky no one was hurt.What's your name?What?Washington.Where are you going?Alaska? Are you on vacation?Cleaner than what?How do you know it's clean?Yeah. That's before the big thaw.Who?Well...Shut up! All of you!I'll have an omelette, no potatoes. Give me tomatoes instead, and wheat toast instead of rolls.What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?Shut up. You have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.You see this sign?I didn't get it, did I?No.Is what you?Who said I was depressed?Oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. I wish I'd known...If you just wouldn't open your mouth, everything would be fine.I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.Okay, Ray...Sure...Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.He doesn't even know who the hell I am.Four or five years.What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.How long have you been staying here?What?Is she?Thanks, Carl...Uhm hmm. Some range.Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.No, I don't. You should've left a long time ago.What questions?Sometimes.Why? Am I some kind of freak to you or something?Sort of.No, I don't really think you're a freak.What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?Uhm hmm.You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...There's nothing to say, Tita...I don't know.Sorry.I guess you fell in the water.That's dangerous, you know.Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.What would I do with it? Run amok?Besides piano and swimming, what else do you do?Nothing.That's right. Have you anything to suggest?What're you doing right now...Then after that?Tomorrow, then.The day after tomorrow.Yeah, I'll probably be free.I gave it a second thought.I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.Of course I do. It's music. You know...What?What?No, thanks...Yeah, well fine, you know what I suggest, Ray... Because I don't know how long. Things are not going that well here...Yeah, well I'm not having any fun, either, so why don't you... No, you can't, it's just not convenient, and I have to get off... Ray, I really have to go, I have to get off now... Another couple of days, maybe. I'll call you and let you -- All right, if you're gone, you're gone. Now I have to get off, okay? Bye, Ray...You sure you should be playing, Carl?I don't know, there's something wrong with the way you move.Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.I'd hate to see you walk across a concert stage like that.Two -- Nineteen.That's what I mean...I think you should get someone to coach you how to walk. I think it's a substantial problem.Look at that.I'm not. He does walk funny. Don't you see that?Yeah, well, he's...I think he's got a terrific personality.Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?At game, Carl.That's three games to none, Carl.I thought you had to go to the mainland today. Aren't you going to miss the ferry?Where is she, anyway?Why don't you and Spicer play?Thank you.It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.I didn't have any.None.Wait...What?Catherine...Shit.You think I'm a fake.No, it isn't what I think.Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response.Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?Some bath oil?What about this one? Or this one? How about some jasmine? What about some musk?What are you doing, screwing around with this crap?!It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.Serious, that's what's important to you?Okay, let's be serious...Shut up...That's right.That's what you said?I'm fine.Is he?Yeah, I think I could.What?Of course I'd like to.I don't know.Rayette.Just finish eating.Oh, for chrissakes...I don't, huh?Where are you going?I have to talk to you.No, I want to talk to you now. I have to explain something about...Yes, it is!Will you shut up for a minute!! Pull your car out of line.Will you let me talk to you, please?Oh. You have to tell me that.Catherine...Don't sit there pointing at her.I said, don't point at her like that! What gives you the right to sit there and tell anybody about class and who the hell's got it, and what she typifies! You shouldn't even be in the same room with her, you creep!You're totally full of shit!You're all full of shit!I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone...Tita, what the hell are you doing?!What's going on here!?Where's Catherine?!I'm talking to you, Tita!Keep your fucking hands off my sister, nurse!I just wanted to talk to you for a minute.Just give me a chance, will you?And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?That'll make you happy.Okay.Are you cold?I don't know if you'd be particularly interested in hearing anything about me. My life, I mean... Most of it doesn't add up to much... that I could relate as a way of life that you'd approve of...I'd like to be able to tell you why, but I don't really... I mean, I move around a lot because things tend to get bad when I stay. And I'm looking... for auspicious beginnings, I guess...I'm trying to, you know, imagine your half of this conversation... My feeling is, that if you could talk, we probably wouldn't be talking. That's pretty much how it got to be before. I left... Are you all right?I don't know what to say...Tita suggested that we try to... I don't know. I think that she... seems to feel we've got... some understanding to reach... She totally denies the fact that we were never that comfortable with each other to begin with... The best I can do, is apologize.We both know I was never really that good at it, anyway...I'm sorry it didn't work out.Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.Bye, now.Come on.No, let's go...Cut it out!No.Fill it up.Hey, wait a minute.No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...No, it's okay.It's all right.
