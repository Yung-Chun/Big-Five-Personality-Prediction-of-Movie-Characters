{"Paul": {"CLIVE": {"raw_line": "Beautiful piece.How much?No, it's rubbish.Do you feel that the killing of Hicks and Newt in Alien 3, invalidates Ripley's struggle at the closed of the previous installment?Clive.Uh... are you... did you?I... I need to photograph him.Really? I wasn't.Yes, very unaffected. Damn, I forgot to give him my card. CLIVE points at SECURITY.Nah. Hey, Rosario Dawson's here!Yes, it's very impressive.That was Graham's idea.I'll have a fat Coke please?Coke.A what?Yes please.Why is it so quiet?Oh man! I wanted to go to that . I wanted to find out if he actually eats the brains.Please.Don't be. The hard work's done, we have a great story and as usual your renderings jump from the page.All we have to do now is sit back and enjoy. A child approaches.Queen Jelva welcomes thee.Main pavillion.Three copies.Yeah, but three copies?Graham, I need a drink.It was like the Prancing Pony in there.They think they're so cool.Hell yes.A-ffirmative. GRAHAM and CLIVE both look at their watches.Three, two, one...Good night, Graham.No.Couldn't hurt could it? We hear some movement then the room is illuminated by the TV. The boys lie on their beds holding games controllers.Cover me.No, that's ours. A large RV pulls up. A 1985 Holiday Rambler, Imperial. Top of the range in its day. Still looks good.Java. Straight up.No, let's punch through. Miles make the eggs taste sweeter.I hear that. Now, get that \"\u0098Joe' on the go and jump in the Chewie seat. I need your map skills.Yeah, I could say \"take the helm.\"\u009dYeah, \"take the helm, number one, I need a number two.\"\u009d They laugh heartily. Through this, GRAHAM has been taking out his laptop and setting it up on the dash board.Absolutely. Real-time sat-nav multi map and advanced geo-tagging with continual info stream?Most impressive.Not when we're driving Graham.Thank god. I'm a wreck until I've had my first cup of J. GRAHAM high fives CLIVE and heads back into the kitchen.Amazing, isn't it? There are 295,734,134 people in this country and we haven't seen a soul for a hundred miles. Where is everybody?Apart from her. I suppose that's why they established the Dreamland facility out here.Did you know the site was selected in the mid-1950s for testing of the U-2 spyplane, due to its remoteness, proximity to existing facilities and presence of a dry lake bad for landings?Oh.Before.How could you tell? We see GRAHAM and CLIVE looking back at PAT. They look like the most painfully obvious Comic-Con attendees ever.Encounter Briefs?I've got all six.Do you get a lot of UFO types round here? We see PAT looking back at CLIVE, surrounded by UFO and alien paraphernalia, a slight smile on her face.And objects.Did you now, it's estimated that there are as many as 200 billion galaxies in the observable universe and each of those has approximately 40 billion starts, around which orbit countless planets and moons?Oh.What?I'd like a cup of coffee please.It's nice here, isn't it?I think I might use the loo. CLIVE walks through a door marked \"\u0098Maliens'. The adjacent toilet door enter. GRAHAM becomes uneasy.That is absolutely amazing!Hey Graham, an alien just sicked up into my palms. CLIVE doesn't see the two men sat up at the counter. He strides over to GRAHAM, full of excitement.I'm joking, of course. They have a soap dispenser, shaped like an alien's head. When you pump his jaw, soap comes out of his mouth.It's hilarious. GRAHAM flicks his eyes to the counter.What? CLIVE looks over and sees the two men. They are glaring back. CLIVE immediately loses his confident air.What took you so long?They were an odd pair, weren't they?No.Nothing. How we doing?I've found it.It's amazing, isn't it? We're actually here.Dreamland.MacArthur's Black Mile.No, I made it up myself.Be great if we saw something.That would be incredible. It just sort of stops in the air and hovers then just goes up really fast. Whoosh.Keep it together. First contact is a big responsibility. They come in peace, we go to pieces? That's not how I roll. CLIVE looks at GRAHAM who is staring off, wide eyed.What's wrong? GRAHAM points off into the distance. HEADLIGHTS.Who? Who's found us?Run for it Marty! GRAHAM and CLIVE scramble for the RV.Of course it's them. We're dead. It's like Deliverance. They're going to rape us and break our arms.There's only one thing for it.I'm gonna have to fly blind.Probably best not to do that. I couldn't really see anything. They stare at the monitor. Suddenly, creeping up the rear of the RV, headlights. The front of a car becomes visible.Oh God, oh God, oh God.Me too. The vehicle behind pulls out to overtake.They're trying to overtake.Should I ram them?It wasn't them. The RV pulls up to the crashed vehicle and stops. GRAHAM and CLIVE peer out of the window.We should see if they're okay.I can hold mine. GRAHAM goes to the back of the RV and into the toilet. CLIVE remains int he driving seat, staring out at the mangled Sedan. The toilet flushes and GRAHAM reappears.Hello? They wait for a few seconds. Nothing.I rather think these men need help. Graham, give me the phone. GRAHAM passes the phone over.I'm feeling like I've gone MENTAL MAD, Graham. If that is your name? You're happily sitting there chatting to... to... that, like it's the most natural thing in the world. The two of you laughing away like you haven't seen each other since 1990. PAUL spits a shell out into a cup.So forgive me if I seem a little rattled but from where I'm standing it would appear you are trading nut knowledge with an alien life form.Oh, Paul is it? Paul what? Paul Verhoven? Paul Freeman? Paul Reiser?No he is not!How could he possibly have travelled that distance?Balls! Graham, this isn't what it seems. What about Ocham's Razor?Yes, the old man who owns it told me that, in unbelievable circumstances, the most plausible explanation is usually the truth.That you're a thin midget in an alien costume.Oh really? With this CLIVE grabs at PAUL. He pulls at the alien's skin, trying to gain a hold of a mask.You're not real. You're not real!Oh shit! CLIVE looks round to discover that PAUL has vanished. GRAHAM pulls the RV onto the hard shoulder.Where's he gone?As if. We would have seen the classic shimmer and hum.Britain.We were having a little drive.He was a good egg.Thank you. May I ask what you're searching for?Well, it's pretty obvious what happened there, isn't it?Yes, the government used some sort of neurotoxic paint on the Black Mailbox, which was white by the way, and it caused us to suffer a shared hallucination about an alien. I mean, it's what we've always wanted, isn't it?Than that's what happened. PAUL materializes from thin air behind them.Where the hell did you go?No thank you.Graham, there is a Grey in the galley, making me coffee.No, I don't want tea.No, what's wried, Graham, is that we have picked up an extra terrestrial hitch hiker and you seem completely fine with it!Why us?What about the RV? It has to be back in two days.I suppose we could phone the hire company and get an extension. PAUL looks super-pleased.How did you get here?Oh my God! Roswell?! That was you?!They invented a fake alien crash to distract from an actual alien crash?What have you been doing here all this time?No thanks.Go on then, I'll have half.Jam.Jelly.Thank you. So, do you know where we're going?Why can't he tell us?Do you trust him, Graham? I mean, is he Strider or Black Rider?You'd better be right. I don't want to wake up and find him inserting a probe into my anus.There's a place called Ely five miles from here. It's small but there should be a gas station.Paul, don't do that!You know this is a gas station? PAUL looks disappointed.Ready?Thanks.Don't you think that's a bit much? Put it all back. Except the burrito... and the doughnuts... and the chocolate milk. Let's just pay for it and leave.Essential only, Graham! They head to the counter. So does the STATE TROOPER.Thank you very much, officer.It's find for you. You'll get whisked back to whatever lab they kept you in and we'll be arrested for harbouring a fugitive and sent to Guantanamo Bay. PAUL laughs.Why's everything so funny? They think we're Muslims.Paul, the authorities know we're in an TV.Ah yes, the waspish markings of a Scott's Oriole. Unmistakable.Nothing anyone could've done. PAUL looks at them, then scoops the bird up in his hands.Why would you do that?Mummy, I am bushed.Best case, I'd like a cold flannel on my neck and an honest meal.Sure. Just not Sausage. Any luck with an RV park? We need somewhere off the beaten track, n'est pas?You read my mind. GRAHAM head to the galley, ignoring PAUL, who jumps into the Chewie seat and stares at CLIVE.Can I help you?No, thank you. I don't smoke. PAUL lights a cigarette, the smoke wafts into CLIVE's face.Could you unwrap it for me?What?No!What are you trying to say?Great find, Graham.Just the way we like it. PAUL scrambles to his feet, reaches across CLIVE and rest on the horn.Stop doing that!We're just a couple of regular guys on a tour of the less touristy side of the American midwest.I was talking to you.Hello Ruth. Do you mind if we come in?Yes. London.Have you been?You don't have a passport? RUTH shakes her head forlornly. GRAHAM and CLIVE stare.Doors to manual and cross check. Graham? Graham?I'll flame up the BBQ pit. Fire's my forte. CLIVE sparks up his lighter and waves it around looking mysterious. He then turns and jumps down all three steps and slams the door of the RV behind him.I am actually, yes.Really?All the good ones die.So you've been here for 60 years?Why did you come to earth?What?!Mulder was right!Would you like a go? PAUL takes the bottle and squirts it on the fire, making the Hendrix face. They laugh loudly.Who is it?Good morning.Yes, thank you.The other one?Oh the other one. Um...I suppose we're men of science.If we believe in anything it would be macro evolution. Cause and effect. The establishment of a biological order from the maelstrom of physical and chemical chaos. RUTH looks scandalized.Did you know that the universe has been dated as being 13.5 billion years old an that the release of neutral hydrogen at the moment of the big bang has enabled scientists to do this with categorical accuracy?Not you!What did you do that for?She saw you!The authorities will be on the look out for exactly this sort of thing.Paul, right now they're going to follow any lead they can get.How am I going to get my passport back? PAUL vanishes.I can't drive like this. We'll have to drop her off and take our chances.Oh great! Everyone knows the secrets of the universe apart from me. He always knew what was going on in Buffy before me because his mum had cable.No spoilers! PAUL sighs, then with enormous effort, reaches up and zaps CLIVE who falls to the floor. Everyone lays inert.Is that where we're going?Someone should go after her. Graham? CLIVE looks round to see GRAHAM gone.Graham!?Small corrections! Small corrections! RUTH drives. Everyone else is asleep.I'm hungry.Hey, it's not fat, it's power. I happen to be very strong. PAUL summons a phlegm ball with a grotesque snort and spits it onto the floor of the RV.So childish.I did it!Okay, in and out, yes? Don't talk to anyone unless you have to and try to look inconspicuous. Angle on the most conspicuous threesome in America.I wish he'd stop doing that! They enter the bar. Parked nearby, is a black Lincoln Escalade, shiny, mean, dented.We'll order food and wait for you at the bar.Be careful. RUTH walks through to the back, past the toilets. As she passes, MOSES BEHE steps out of the Men's, they miss each other by moments. He walks up to the bar, next to GRAHAM and CLIVE who are looking at a menu. MOSES orders.We're still waiting on a wet fries. The two MEATHEADS emerge from the pay phone. Angry.Look, I'm terribly sorry. Perhaps we can exchange insurance details?He said, leave her alone. At this, JAKE pulls his fist back to hit CLIVE, knocking a tray of drinks all over a table full of men. They immediately spring up and lunge after the MEATHEADS who turn their attention to the attack. The fight spreads like fire. GRAHAM grabs RUTH's hand and follows CLIVE as he scrambles through the fracas. As they reach the door RUTH is yanked back and comes face to face with her father.Graham?Graham, take Ruth into the RV and lock the door. I don't want either of you to see this. CLIVE turns back to the MEATHEADS. BANG! CLIVE is struck in the face, he falls, nose bleeding. They turn to RUTH and GRAHAM, who back up against the RV. The MEATHEADS approach ominously. The RV door bursts open. PAUL stands silhouetted against the interior lights.Who? Who are you talking about?He was so angry.I'm game.What about when I got smacked in the nose?Thank you. He mops his nose as they leave the RV. GRAHAM lingers.Let's party!Is it spelt like, P-'-a-w-l-l or something?Paul Simon.I can speak Klingon.Hey!Roooooootttttttccchhaaaa.Calm down, Rog. More laughter. Even PAUL. He lights his joint.She called her dog Paul?It's strange, isn't it? Ordinarily in this situation Graham and I would be looking up at the stars, wondering about life on other planets but we know now, don't we? It's a bit of an anti-climax.I don't mean that in a bad way. They all scratch their noses.How so?Stool?I don't follow.I thought the crash was our fault.Comic-Con 2005. Ewok chick.She was an Ewok! Sniff.She was a midget.I know. I'm sorry.How did that happen?Oh, thank God. For a second there I thought I'd got drunk on Lite beer. The guys gather their stuff and walk to the edge of the wood. Looking through the tree line they realize that the quiet town of last night has become very busy indeed.How are we going to get back? Close in on GRAHAM having the best idea of his life.You could be a midget.I must have it.Oh, come on, we've got time.Who was that?$299.99. It's made of a low grade Turkish alloy.What are you going to do with this?Us?What shall we say if it's her? We're here with the alien that killed your dog sixty years ago?Knock again.Tara Walton?Miss Walton, I'm the writer, Clive Gollings and this is my friend and colleague, Graham Willy. We're from England and we're here with the alien that killed your dog 60 years ago. Silence. The sound of multiple locks. The door opens to reveal a woman . Grey, dishevelled but with fire in her eyes. She scowls at GRAHAM and CLIVE.It's no joke. PAUL materializes between GRAHAM and CLIVE.Yes?I'll drive!I think we have a problem.What?They're trying to overtake.Shall I ram him?What are we doing exactly?Are you sure you know what you're doing?!Paul!Where did it go?They're still coming!They're gaining!Great Caesar's ghost!We've lost them. TEAM PAUL erupt into cheers. PAUL jumps in the air and whoops. He high five GRAHAM and pats CLIVE on the back. GRAHAM embraces RUTH and tries to kiss her, she pulls away.I only saw one car following us.Oh no.Fare thee well friend. You were a faithful and mighty steed.He's not going anywhere.Blind fury. The blade falls off.Bloody low grade Turkish alloy.He's not a goblin he's from another planet.You can keep it.You are, and always will be, our friend.Oh, say hi from us, won't you?

I was actually a bit nervous.Good egg, wasn't he?Give it to Colossus.She NEEDS to call me.When do we start?I'm nervous.Thank you.That's sick.Would you like a copy?Nasty Hobbitses. CLIVE emerges from the bathroom. He is naked but for a black towel wrapped around his waist. His hair is wet and suddenly incredibly long. Around his neck, a large animal tooth hangs on a black leather cord.Hey, are you excited about going to Area 51?06.30 check out?Good night, Clive. They switch off their respective bedside lights. The room is plunged into pitch darkness. A few seconds pass.Are you asleep?Shall we try and storm the Citadel before we nod off?That's not ours.Breakfast?Any solids?I love eggs!Good job I pre-pared. GRAHAM flicks on the coffee and jumps into the co-pilot's seat.It's a shame I don't have some controls on this side. That way, I could take over if you needed the loo.\"Take the helm, number one.\"\u009d\"\u0098Least I've got Cerebro, eh?Impressive.And let's not forget, we've always got Analogue. GRAHAM pulls a map down. Obscuring the entire windshield.Sorry. GRAHAM sends the map back up into the roller. The coffee percolator gurgles in the galley.Sounds like coffee o'clock.Looks like a pile of dead droids. A perky waitress approaches. GRAHAM and CLIVE become shy and awkward.What about that old woman on crutches we saw hitchhiking?Far from prying eyes.Yes.Shall we have a bite before or after we hit the Black Mailbox?Have you ever seen one?Really?! You've seen more than one UFOs?Can I have an E.T. malt please?Absolutely.I was putting the sticker on.Definitely didn't speak Bocci. CLIVE fires up the engine and jams it into reverse. CRUNCH.That wasn't their truck was it?What's the matter?We should be just about there. They scan the roadside for a few seconds.Where?Area 51.The Groom Lake Military Test Facility.Is that a real one?I like it.Yes, imagine if we got buzzed up by a craft.What would you do if they actually landed?It's them. They found us. I don't know how but they found us.The Libyans!Perhaps it's not them. Perhaps whoever it was turned doff.I don't want my arms broken!What?I need the toilet.Don't let them get past.What about the deposit? CLIVE gingerly jerks the wheel, causing the RV to swerve. A BLACK SEDAN car appears next to them, manoeuvering wildly to avoid the RV. GRAHAM and CLIVE stare in horror, their eyes widen as the car flips over and tumbles several times, bouncing across the asphalt and sliding to a smoking stop on its roof. GRAHAM's mouth hangs open. CLIVE blinks.I still need a wee.The bulb's gone in there.Maybe you should call for help. GRAHAM pulls out a cell phone and starts to dial.What have you done to him?Yes but you made him faint.You've got a phaser!?Are you going to probe us?Don't you?What?You need my help?How come I can understand you? Are you using some sort of neural language router?Graham Willy.That's the writer, Clive Gollings.Where are we going?The RV's gotta be back in 2 days.Okay then.What's your name?Paul?I told him he should have gone.Uh... yes.Paul? Where am I going again?Sorry.Them? Who's them?I usually bite them open.That's molluscs.It's true.His name is Paul.Paul's from a small planet in the northern spiral arm of the Andromeda Galaxy.The hairdressers?He's right. I think that's less believable than Paul being form a planet in the norther spiral arm of the Andromeda Galaxy.Excuse me.Maybe he beamed up.Good point.Very unaffected.Is it?I suppose so.What, you went invisible?Like Predator?Can you do it whenever you want?Hello Paul. GRAHAM approaches CLIVE who ignores him.What's the matter?Did you want tea?Tea's a bit weird in America, isn't it?He needs our help, Clive. PAUL returns with the coffee. GRAHAM and CLIVE curtail their conversation. PAUL hand CLIVE his coffee.Clive, he's an alien. A living, breathing, alien. CLIVE look at PAUL who makes a sad face and does the hand gesture from Close Encounters. CLIVE wilts.Happens to the best of us.Not just the government.You'd be surprised how much he's influenced popular culture generally over the last 60 years.We had quite a long chat while you were unconscious. CLIVE looks miffed....while you were asleep.Yes please.I gave your jeans a swill and hung them up.Just North. He said we had to make a right at Utah.He said it was a surprise.Strider, definitely.It's okay, he doesn't do that. PAUL returns with three bagels on one long finger.Fuel level's critical.For fuel?Roger that, number one.Ready. HOOOONNNNNKKKK! GRAHAM and CLIVE jump.We need bulb for the toilet.Britain.Poor thing.What are you doing? PAUL closes his eyes. His skin ripples with color as he sways slightly. The bird's eyes flicker, its head lifts, it opens its beak and tweets. GRAHAM and CLIVE are astounded by what they are seeing.It's a miracle!What do you think?You tired, Sausage?Sorry. Are you tired though?What do you need?I hear that, Big-Rig. I can still call you Big-Rig can't I?Roger that. Cup of Joe?Honey Bun?By your command.I sourced a website listing off the beaten track, North American RV parks.It's awfully quiet.Someone's coming. PAUL shimmers and disappears. GRAHAM and CLIVE yelp.I don't think she heard you.Oh, sorry.We're just a couple of regular guys on tour of the less touristy side of the American midwest.Uh, east... apparently. CLIVE returns with his passport. RUTH looks at it.You should.Hmmm? PAUL re-materializes next to GRAHAM and CLIVE.Hungry?Willies! PAUL gives CLIVE a \"\u0098see what I mean?' look.Ha ha yeah.Yes. CLIVE give GRAHAM a \"\u0098what the hell are you thinking?' Look as RUTH comes aboard. RUTH surveys the interior of the RV.I like your shirt. The shirt has a picture of Jesus shooting Charles Darwin in the head. Underneath it reads, \"Evolve this!\"\u009dWhy would Jesus want to shoot Charles Darwin?Would you like a coffee?Or it could be God. You just don't know do you?Yes.We could take her with us.We're only going to be a couple of days. We could let her go once Paul's gone home. I'm sure she'll be fine once she gets to know us. PAUL and CLIVE consider this.Hi.Would you like a cup of tea? RUTH starts to pray furiously.I'm so sorry it had to be this way Ruth. We're definitely not going to hurt you and we'll let you go as son as we can. We were just a little concerned that you might call the police.He's not a demon Ruth, he's from another world and we're helping him get home. He's not evil. He's just very rude.I think what Paul's trying to say is, just because there are other inhabited planets, it's not the end of the world.No!What did you do to her?!Can you broaden mine?Oh please.Ruth!Ruth, please stop, I've got shin splints. RUTH stops. GRAHAM catches up to her.Are you alright?Ruth, you saw for yourself. It's not just possible, it's probably. There's probably millions of intelligent civilizations.Well, one of them is right there. RUTH and GRAHAM look back at the RV. PAUL is stood on the dashboard with his bare buttocks pressed against the window. CLIVE is trying not to laugh.Just because your truth wasn't the truth, it doesn't mean there is no truth, Ruth.I understand you're probably feeling very confused right now. Religious belief systems are devised to give us context and security. To stop us feeling lonely and unimportant.It isn't, it's a coincidence. Or it probably is. That's the beauty of the universe.This is the point, Ruth. Right now. This conversation. That tree, your next cheeseburger. Life is a miracle. People spend so much time focusing on rescuing the princess, they forget how much fun it is to fight the dragon.Carl Sagan said \"\u0098A religion, old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.'It's okay not to know, Ruth. It's wonderful because it means we still have things to learn. We still have life to live.So am I, but it passes, sort of. Ruth, we're on an amazing adventure and I think you should come with us. I know you feel confused and lost but if you get back on board that RV, you might just find the very thing you're looking for.I'm sure Ruth. I'm sure because I can honestly say, I have never talked to a woman for this long without blushing.She's going to be fine. I think your hair looks good by the way. You look like Storm.Exactly. RUTH goes to the bathroom.It looks nice.How's your dad?Leave her alone!Ha! Only one of us fainted!Who?Was that your dad, Ruth? RUTH nods.Are you alright, Ruth? RUTH nods, still distant.You want to come for a walk, Ruth?It was amazing though, wasn't it? Remember when Paul said \"\u0098Yo fucknuts'? That was brilliant.You can sleep in my bunk if you'd like. She smiles at him. He goes to leave but turns back.I'd use a pen to push the tissues off the bed. I've had a cold.Space cowboy.No.Bob Dylan's still alive.So why \"\u0098Paul'? It's not very, you know, alien.P-o-o-u-r-l?What's your real name?Come on, what's your real name. PAUL opens his mouth and screeches.Rootchaa? That sounds like Roger.You look like a poster on a student's wall.You never answered my question. Why Paul? Who called you Paul?What happened to the little girl?Paul, can I ask you something?Why are you in such a hurry to leave?So?So what, do they take a swab from your cheek?Blood?! Oh my god, I hate needles.So, you're saying if they catch you... PAUL draws his thumb across his neck. GRAHAM and CLIVE look at PAUL in horror. All three scratch their heads.Like in E.T.?Oh dear!Maybe we should hold hands, so that we look like a family.Seem to be working, Clive. Clive? GRAHAM notices that CLIVE is no longer with them. He looks back to see CLIVE, gawping thought the window of a COMIC SHOP, at a sword resembling the one they saw at Comic-Con. The tag reads \"\u0098Genuine \"\u0098BLADE' Katana'. $299.99.Clive, no. CLIVE walks into the shop. GRAHAM and PAUL follow quickly behind. As they enter the COMIC SHOP, MOSES BEHE emerges from the adjacent Drug Store. He takes a couple of pain killers and flexes his sore shoulders. He wanders up the road, scanning the passers by.Now's not really the time, Sausage.It's very cheap. Are you sure you don't want to save up and get a proper on?X-Men action figure.You don't think she's still there do you?Hello?Okay. GRAHAM goes to leave. CLIVE stops him.We're cut off.Ow, my shins!Punch it!Your dad's persistent, isn't he?What do we do?It's gone!What games?Sorry.That was just awesome. Amazing driving Clive. It was like G.T.A. but potentially fatal. Wasn't it, Clive? Clive? A knocking and a gurgling sound is coming from the engine.There goes the deposit.Paul?What now?Leave her alone! VOICE throws them off and comes face to face with TARA.Noooooooooo! GRAHAM gathers RUTH up in his arms. She coughs, flecks of blood around her mouth.He's an alien you stupid man! Oh Ruth, Ruth I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I should have never persuaded you to come with us. RUTH focuses on GRAHAM. She smiles, weakly.Ruth, are you okay?What did you think?No, thank you.That was good, wasn't it?Hey babe.

Now let's get Cloverfield onto the recreational vehicle and get the fuck off MacArthur's Black Mile. They attempt to move CLIVE. PAUL senses something.Oh man, has he...?Could have been worse. Know what I'm saying? They drag him into the RV. The door shuts, a few seconds later, GRAHAM appears and runs round to the back of the RV. He rips the bumper sticker off and gets back on board. The RV starts up and drives off.Can I have this ham?Great! PAUL starts to dangle strips of sandwich ham into his mouth, wolfing it down hungrily.I told you, North. Do you have a map? GRAHAM pulls the map. It obscures the wind shield.Not when we're driving, Graham.Just head North. We need to get as much distance as we can between us and them.The bulb's gone in there. CLIVE gets up silently and wraps his black towel around his middle. He creeps toward the front of the RV. GRAHAM drives, PAUL sits in the Chewie seat eating pistachios.I hate it when you get the closed ones, right?Are you fucking insane? You gotta tap \"\u0098em and if they don't open you throw them away.Shut up.Just Paul. You know, like Madonna or Dracula.I am man, seriously.Wormhole.And what's the most plausible explanation, Clive?There's no such thing as a thin midget? Those guys are built. Have you not seen The Station Agent?Ow! Get off me!Get off me, you fucking psycho!Nowhere.It's not invisibility per so. It's more like what a chameleon does with a little light blending thrown in for good measure.Exactly.You sure? How about a cup of coffee? Come on Hulk, I'll get you a nice cuppa J. PAUL goes back to the galley, flicking GRAHAM on the nose as he passes. GRAHAM wakes up with a start.Hey, look who's up!Look Clive, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this is probably the weirdest thing that's ever happened to you. Am i right? CLIVE doesn't deny it.And I appreciate the fact that I have somewhat gate-crashed the party here but, truth be told, I'm in a hell of a pickle. I really need your help.Why not? CLIVE glances back at an expectant GRAHAM.Crashed in \"\u009847. Anti-grav failure.Also, I'm a shit driver.Roswell was a smoke-screen man, designed to distract from the truth.I know, fucking stupid, isn't it?Oh you know, kickin' back, shooting the shit. Advising the government.How about molecular revivification.Restoration of damaged tissue through telepathic manipulation of cellular intrinsic field memory.Healing, Steven.You know what? Sometimes, less is more. The line beeps.Yeah I gotta take this man. It's the fucking V guys again.Right.You want a bagel Clive?Graham?You want anything on it?What?Gotcha. PAUL heads to the kitchen. The boys drive in silence.Bagel time! The dashboard beeps. PAUL jumps throwing them into the air.Sorry, I had a warning light just like that on my ship.Anti-grav failure. CLIVE is looking at the sat-nav on the computer.Here's what I need. Some organic beef mince, organic pork, some veal, red onions, pine nuts, pecorino cheese, plum tomatoes, a fistful of fresh basil and 3 war ciabattas.Get me some more peanut M&Ms. GRAHAM goes into the store, CLIVE to the pumps. A POLICE CRUISER pulls onto the forecourt. CLIVE goes pale and fumbles the nozzle back into the pump. He walks toward the checkout as a STATE TROOPER exits his car. No matter how hard he tries, CLIVE cannot avoid reaching the door at the same time as the STATE TROOPER. He is tall, wide and bald.That's their excuse for everything. There are worse things you can be. We had a Muslim guy at the base. Systems analyst called Yusef. We used to do karaoke on Tuesday nights. You should'a heard him do Matthew and Son. Shame I didn't get a chance to say salam alaikum.We're hardly the only RV on the road. Trust me, if we stay off the highways, keep to the back routes, we'll have a nice uneventful journey. BANG!!! Something strikes the windshield. Everyone jumps. GRAHAM bring the RV to a halt. Silence.Fuck, that made me jump.What a waste.I'll miss these.I'm not gonna eat a dead bird, amAsk me when I've finished it. CLIDE rubs his yes.You want a cigarette?Look, I'm sorry okay? About eating the bird. CLIVE continues to ignore PAUL. GRAHAM arrives with the coffee and a Honey Bun cake.Let me ask you something. Are you to...?You know... PAUL does a very weird, very long charade, demonstrating various \"\u0098group' and \"\u0098one on one' homosexual practices.Okay, that's great. I just wondered. I'm cool with it. Everyone's \"\u0098bi' where I'm from. It's all about the pleasure thing, you know? We've evolved beyond paranoid notions of gender identity. I mean, procreation is only the functional aspect of sexual congress right? The human race is fairly advanced but most males still act like a cornered tiger if you imply the like \"\u0098smoking the bone' and let's face it they probably do. Look at single sex, empirical institutions, boarding schools, prisons, pirate ships, places where the choice has been removed, everyone's banging everyone else and there isn't a whiff of socio-cultural angst. Get out into the real world and guys are getting smacked int he chops for wearing pink socks. You think you're so sophisticated because you can distinguish yourself from your own reflection but ultimately you're part of a deeply neurotic species and you'd all be a lot better off if you stopped worrying and learned to love the bum.Maybe you should start smoking.I really lucked out with you nerds, didn't I? GRAHAM and CLIVE look proud. CLIVE drives the RV over a speed hump into the park. PAUL loses his balance and falls over. GRAHAM and CLIVE laugh. They pull up to a gate.Arrghh, what the fuck?!I ate already. GRAHAM and CLIVE look suddenly sad.Too soon? They nod.Hey, I'm sorry. I'd love to break bread with you guys. What are we having? GRAHAM waves a foot long hot dog around.Hello Clive. From the squirting of the gas and the flicking of the tongue, am I do assume you're a Hendrix fan?I met him once.Yeah. Nice man, really soft, He thought I was a hallucination. Shame what happened to him.Meanwhile Bryan Adams releases album seventeen. PAUL and CLIVE share a laugh.I know, right? Time flies when you're confined to a U.S. military installation.I'm the vanguard of a highly aggressive invading force.I'm fucking with you, man. I was on a science mission actually. Meteorological reconnaissance. We were surveying atmospheric conditions on CO2 spiking, M-Class planets. My specialist subject is tornadoes right? So I'm buzzing around the mid-west, looking for twisters and all of a sudden my A.G.G. goes offline and I crash in the middle of some field.Next thing I know, this little girl is pulling me out of the wreck and then a bunch of army guys come along and cart me off to Area 52.No, it's 52. Area 51 is just full of old Pan Am jets and mini disc players and shit. It's another \"clever subterfuge.\"\u009d GRAHAM joins them with the food.Just telling him about Area 52.So, with my cover blown and the natives cautious but friendly, I figured we might as well indulge in a little file sharing.Mulder was my idea. They chuckle. CLIVE gives PAUL the bottle of gas.I'm in the can. I ate a closed mollusc. PAUL blows a massive raspberry to prove his point. GRAHAM and CLIVE look embarrassed. GRAHAM changes the subject.Oh come on!Horseshit! RUTH approaches the toilet door, taking up her fight with the unseen third passenger. She bangs on the door. GRAHAM and CLIVE are bewildered by this sudden turn of events.Oh, don't give me that old irreducible complexity crap-But it didn't just occur did it? It is the culmination of millions of years of development across countless species.Evolution baby. RUTH screams and bangs the door.If He designed it, why didn't He just make it one part and take the whole weekend off?Oh yeah? Well then how do you explain me? RUTH's mouth hangs agape in a soundless scream, her eye rolls up, her hair turns white. She collapses.And that's Jenga.I didn't do anything, she fainted.Oh come on. Who's gonna believe anything she says?What, a delusional, one-eyed God botherer?I didn't think of that.Leave it to me.Hallelujah.Boo?Hey, look who's up.You know I'm sitting right here?Look, if it makes you feel any better, my existence only disproves the notion of the Abrahamic, Judeo- Christian God, as well as all single earth theologies. Science still hasn't categorically rule out the notion of divinity, even though evolutionary biology suggest the non-existence of a creator by probability alone.Jesus Christ, I was just trying to be nice!You can't win can you? RUTH starts to pray furiously, speaking in tongues, making an awful noise.Oh, for God's sake. PAUL walks over to RUTH and places his and across her forehead. He appear to go into a trance. RUTH's eyes roll up into her head. We see a lightening montage of images. The cosmos, the surface of a planet, others like PAUL, PAUL's ship crashing into the ground. The images speed up as PAUL telepathically send his knowledge into RUTH's mind. They collapse in a heap on the floor. PAUL sparks up a cigarette.I broadened her horizons.No, it's tiring. GRAHAM goes over to where PAUL is lying.Come here then. PAUL puts his hand on GRAHAM's head. GRAHAM's eyes go all fluttery. We don't see the images this time. GRAHAM falls.Can't I just tell you?Wow. Pull out to reveal him sitting next to GRAHAM and CLIVE, looking out through the RV's windshield. We see their POV. A breathtaking panorama of natural beauty. They are parked up at the summit of a mountain road, looking out across the vista.There it is, boys. Wyoming.Maybe. I gotta tell ya. It's at times like these you winder if the intelligent design crowd aren't onto something. I mean look at it. Hey Ruth, get up here. They look round, the door of the RV is open, RUTH is gone.Ruth!?From X-Men.11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 11 o'clock. Come on! It's fun. We see CLIVE, GRAHAM and RUTH standing in the middle of the road watching PAUL.Hey, we should stop for something to eat. Are you hungry, Ruth?What's new, fatty?Pick that up then.Right up top! RUTH yelps, terrified that PAUL is going to zap her again.Too soon? CLIVE reaches down and picks up PAUL's phlegm ball.Yo fucknuts! The MEATHEADS freeze. PAUL vanishes, then reappears a few feet from them, their eyes bulge.So, who wants to get probed first? The MEATHEADS swoon and simultaneously hit the deck.Tell me you got the food? CLIVE gets up and opens his coat revealing bags of food. Sirens wail in distance. RUTH turns white.Get in the RV! SMASH CUT. The RV roars to life, backing up at speed into the MEATHEAD's vehicle. MOSES BEHE bursts out of the bar, just as the RV passes. RUTH sees him out of the window. MOSES locks eye with his daughter. He runs to his pick up but realises he doesn't have his keys. The RV tears off into the night, leaving MOSES BEHE bellowing with anger and the Lincoln Escalade, shiny, mean, fucked.I'm feeling pretty amped up. Anyone wanna take a walk?Sorry about that.You gotta talk the talk, right?Yeah yeah Snorlax, you're a real hero. Come on. Let's skedaddle. You want anything Ruth?Hey Graham. Check this out. What d'ya think? PAUL indicates to a small cowboy outfit, big enough for a child, displayed in the window.I'd look pretty hot, right?Steve Miller Band. I love that song. Speaking of midnight tokers, I got a littler herbal refreshment in my pants. Do you guys partake?Shame. I get it from the military. This is the shit that killed Dylan.Is he? CLIVE comes out of the liquor store clutching bags of beer.No.No, it's Paul. Like Paul Newman or the little guy from Simon and Garfunkel.Paul Simon. Paul's not my real name. It's a name I got given.You won't be able to pronounce it.What a geek.Roooooootttchaaaaaaaaaaa.That's pretty good.Fuck you!That was my gag! \"\u0098Take me to your dealer' right? Yeah, that was mine. Never saw a dime.The little girl who found me when I crashed. It was terrible actually. I killed her dog. I didn't mean to! My ship sort of landed on it. When the military arrived I was delirious; I kept saying \"Paul? Paul?\"\u009d It was the only English I knew, because I'd heard the little girl saying it over and over. Spooks thought it was my name.Least it wasn't Mr. Muggles.Who knows? Never saw her again. Think about her everyday though. PAUL offers the joint round. CLIVE and GRAHAM decline. PAUL takes a deep drag. During the following exchange, GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL start to move simultaneously as though governed by some kind of psychic link.Thanks a bunch, Hurley.Shoot.I've outlived my usefulness.There's only so much knowledge I can share about the universe and quantum theory and how to make a really nice meatball sandwich. The only thing I have to offer them now are my abilities.So the only way they're going to get hold of them is by obtaining some of somatic stem cells.Negative.Sadly, not that simple.Believe me, a needle would be a picnic compared to what they had in store for me.Stem cells are multipotent. GRAHAM and CLIVE look blank.Lineage defined? GRAHAM and CLIVE still look blank.The camouflage response, the memory transfer, the revivification, they all originate in my cerebellum. In order to cultivate them in a laboratory they would have to...Bingo! Fortunately, someone was kind enough to give me the heads up, if you'll pardon the pun. So, when they were transferring me to the medical facility and I noticed the bumper sticker on your RV, I figured you might be sympathetic types. I zapped the spooks, grabbed the wheel and took my chance.Well it was, kinda.So tell me, are you guys virgins or what?Alright then, Clive, when was the last time you got laid.Three years ago you had sex with a midget?There are only two types of person small enough to fit inside an Ewok costume.I can't believe you thought boning a space bear sounded less embarrassing than a person of short stature.Was it nice?You sly dog! PAUL rolls onto his back, clapping. GRAHAM snorts into his beer, laughing. CLIVE joins in. Before long, the three friends are rolling around in hysterics, utterly out of control. After about thirty seconds of this, they pass out.Oh shit! Hey, wake up. Wake up. We fell asleep.Sorry, I get this thing when I get high. It's called \"\u0098projective empathy'. You feel what I feel.Exactly.I can't walk through there.That's great! Two grown men who look like sex offenders holding hands with a child cowboy.You're obsessed with midgets! They continue on, trying to look as if nothing is strange.How's it going?No.Suppose it does. What's your name?I'm Paul. Pleased to meet you. They shake hands.You on your own here, Keith Nash?Sounds like a good Mum.My friend's buying a sword. He's a grown man.You an M&Ms man, Keith? PAUL produces his M&Ms. He offers one to KEITH.Strangers with candy, right?Well, we've got a lot in common. We both like comics and M&Ms. Guess that makes us pals.You read this one?It's a good one. Take it. Go on. It's a gift.Catch you later, Keith Nash. GRAHAM and CLIVE approach. CLIVE has a long sword shaped box under his arm and a big grin on his face.Keith Nash. How much was that?What did you get, speccy?Jesus Cheeeerist.He likes you, y'know?What are you, blind? Beat.Sorry. Beat.What you got there, a stigmatism?You know you can get on operation for that, right?Hey, I don't know categorically that it's godless. I just said \"\u0098probably'.Look, the way you're feeling now, that's why religion appeared in the first place. It's like existential Prozac. Imagine being five year sold and having no adults around to tell you why it snows or what trees are for. That's how it is for much of humanity. Faith is a night- light. It illuminates the scary corners, fills the gaps, makes the universe easier to comprehend. Thing is, it's okay not to know everything. I mean, who knows what's really out there? Did you know astrophysicists recently identified the equation for the creation of matter?Oh. Well, then you get it, right? If they have the theory, who's to say at some point in the future they won't put it into practice and who's to say someone else didn't do that 13.5 Billion years ago and that's how the universe came to be? Course, then we get the eternal problem of who created the creator but that's a whole other car park. I think Shakespeare said it best. \"There's more in Heaven and earth than is dreamt of in your philosophy Horatio\"\u009d.Horatio. It's from Hamlet. You know, the Prince of Denmark?Anyway, if there is a God, didn't he create doctors and hospitals and scalpels and shit, so he wouldn't have to go round fixing people's lazy eyeballs?The eye is a delicate and complex thing, Ruth. You should get it taken care of. RUTH smiles. PAUL smiles back. RUTH looks out of the window, just as PAUL reaches out to touch her face.Perfect.Phone home.That's what you're going to find out for me.I can't just knock can I? What if she's moved on and someone else answers? I'm sick of people fainting on me. I'll hang back with my buddy Ruth, you two make first contact. Just enjoy it.Yes. Hurry up, there's going to be a really big storm in exactly 34 minutes.It's my job to know.Hello Tara. TARA's faces sickens. She falls backwards into the house.Aw nuts.Can I do anything to help? TARA stand in the kitchen doorway, the lit match in her hand. PAUL stands and walks toward her, she watches him.I'm so sorry.For killing your dog and ruining your life.It's good to see you, Tara. The tinkle of glass. Something hits the floor. A tear gas canister spins at their feet, spewing thick fog.Fuck a duck! Get out!Tara, where's the back door?Clive?A little help?Not a fucking cent.Come on!Come on.Go left.Don't let him get past.Twenty seconds.Stay on target. A branch smacks on the windshield, cracking it.Stay on target.Ruth, why don't you count back fromBack where I'm from, tornadoes are part of our daily life. We've learnt how to live with them, how to understand them.We've learnt to anticipate their behavior, know their personalities, know when they're playing games.Hide and seek?Evolution baby.Where's Tara? TARA comes out of the toilet.We're here. PAUL is stood away from the RV at the foot of a small hill. He starts to climb. The others follow. Crane up as TEAM PAUL climb the hill to reveal a sight familiar to anyone who has seen Close Encounters Of The Third Kind... DEVIL's TOWERWe call them IFOs.I-thank-you.This is it. PAUL takes out the firework, Zippo and cigarettes from his back pack. He lights his last cigarette and takes a drag.I'll miss these. PAUL takes the firework a little way off and sticks it in the ground. He crouches down and lights the touch paper with the cigarette, then scampers back to the gang. Beat. The firework rises into the sky. It explodes. The star-burst is massive and bright red, it illuminates the tower.We wait. A light appears in the sky some way off.Wait a minute... A HELICOPTER swoops in to land, kicking dust and debris into the air. TEAM PAUL turn back to the woods but are stopped by the sight of a torch getting nearer.Oh shit. Behind them, the HELICOPTER powers down. The door opens.Lorenzo?! PAUL spins round. We go into slow motion. ZOIL fires. The bullet explodes from the gun, straight at us. Angle on the bullet as it passes in ECU. The shot moves round behind the bullet to reveal PAUL, looking shocked. The bullet whizzes past him, slamming into one of the soldiers. ZOIL rolls, coming to rest on one knee. He fires a second shot into the leg of the other soldier who collapses. He leaves his gun at VOICE just as the PILOT bursts from the cockpit. The PILOT fires but misses ZOIL. ZOIL takes out his shoulder, spinning him off his feet. VOICE steps forward, holding a smoking gun.How'd you find me?Thank you, Tara.You know I appreciate it.There is no way this thing isn't gonna end happy.Looks like the geek shall inherit the earth.Happens to the best of us.I'm sorry I frightened you so much your hair turned white.Whatever dude. They high five. PAUL turns to ZOIL, whose arm is in a makeshift sling and shakes his hand.Lorenzo Zoil, you're a good man. Say bye to Karen for me.Cool. Okay.Yeah. Three tits, awesome. Although you know what? Sometimes, less is more. The boys nod.Thank you.Come here you fucking geeks. They hug. He takes in incandescent orb from his pocket.This is a self-sustaining light orb. Might come in handy, you know, if a bulb goes. TARA is waiting for her goodbye but PAUL ignores her. He face drops as he walks to his ship. He turns to her.You coming?I ruined your life Tara. Think I owe you a new one. TARA takes PAUL's hand.Baby, where we're going, you won't need teeth. TARA frowns then follows PAUL aboard. PAUL and TARA stand in the doorway. One of the other ALIENS comes out of a small room behind them, speaking in a strange tongue. Subtitle: THE BULB'S GONE IN THERE. As the door slowly closes, GRAHAM and CLIVE give PAUL the CE3K salute. PAUL gives them the finger. The boys laugh, tears in their eyes. The ship lifts off into the sky. GRAHAM, CLIVE, RUTH, MOSES and ZOIL watch them go. The light form the ship gradually fades, leaving them in darkness.
