{"Beginners": {"OLIVER": {"raw_line": "Yeah yeah.You're coming to live with me now. Arthur looks at him.This is my car. Arthur hops in.This is the dining room where people come and eat sometimes. The dog listens intently. Oliver moves on, the dog follows.This is the living room.That's the bathroom. The dog looks.This is 2003. This is what the sun looks like, and the stars, nature. This is the President.This is what it looked like when people kissed......When they were happy......When they were sad.My parents got married in 1955.He was a museum director - she fixed up old houses.They had a child, and they stayed married for 44 years......Until she died in their bed, after four months of cancer and eating French toast for every meal and watching the Teletubbies everyday and confusing white straws for her cigarettes and skipping back and forth through time inside her head.Six months later, my father told me he was gay. He had just turned 75.He changed all his clothes.Look, its lonely out here, so you'd better learn how to talk with me. Arthur's face looks up at him filled with a dog's love and no words.I know. I know.Calm. Calm, calm breaths. Hal coughs.Pop, Pop, stop -- you're gonna hurt yourself. A NURSE quickly enters and helps hold down his arms.No, Pop.She's a great nurse in the hospital, we don't really know her, you're very high on drugs.No, Pop, I just don't want to be like you and mom. Thank you...Go have your own experiences with your own people. I'll be right here... Arthur stays by Oliver's side.I'm a human. I'm not a dog. And you're a Jack Russell, that's a breed. Your personality was created by this guy John Russell, a hunting enthusiast, in the 1800s. And he bred your ancestors to have stamina and courage for the hunt. You think you're just you, and you want to chase the foxes, but other people planted that in you years ago.Now, somewhat arbitrarily, you are considered very cute by us humans, and we keep breeding you not to chase foxes, but to be cute, and we put you in movies and television shows, and you, you're chasing tennis balls cause there as close to a fox as you're going to get. Arthur stays by Oliver's side.Want me to read this? I found it in your books.Nice.Oh, Andy brought those for you.Well, I don't know. Its just a painting on the wall. Hal continues exploring, Oliver's enjoying his father's curiosity, he lands on some photos displayed on the table.They're just photos, Pop.They're just personal photos. They're not art. Hal slowly moves the flashlight up the wall, across the ceiling to a strange assortment of fire detectors, sprinklers, sensors, all laid out against the acoustic tile ceiling. Hal points up. Oliver looks for a beat, then...Uh, well that's the water sprinkler thing.What is?Jesus, Liz. Another band that wants portraits.You do something decent once, and that's all people ever want. JUMP CUT through the different portraits developing. It's not what Oliver want's to do.Yeah?Arthur, you haven't been invited to this party. You're gonna stay and look after the house. Oliver tentatively shuts the door, takes three steps, Arthur begins to howl. Oliver tries to ignore it, but stops again. He looks back at the house and the howling.His name's Arthur - he doesn't do tricks. In the background are a couple dressed as JULIAN and ETHEL ROSENBERG, we see them observe Oliver and Arthur.Does it make you feel powerful to order my dog around? Maybe give you a sense of power?Thanks, yeah. Very good. Oliver picks up Arthur and escapes the kitchen. The Rosenberg's are still watching.Yeah.I'm sorry. Our time is up, uh... for this week. Thank you for coming in. The witch moves on. Oliver sits with Arthur in his lap, alone, lost in all this joviality. We see that the woman dressed as Julius Rosenberg is watching him. Just as Oliver is about to get up, she plops herself down onto the couch, ready for her session.Well, I guess we should start with your mother. The woman writes on her notepad and shows it to Oliver: \"Never had one.\"Well then your father. She mimes shooting herself in the head and dying.I don't understand. You can't talk? Is it a mental problem? Do you need analysis? She writes on her pad: \"I have laryngitis\"That's a physical problem. She smiles at him, looks at him a little too long, Oliver is more and more pulled in by her playfulness - she writes: \"Why are you at a party if you're sad?\" CU on Oliver, surprised and impressed by her observation.I was doing such a good job of hiding it. How could you tell? Ethel holds up her notebook. She has drawn TWO EYES. Oliver's taken by her.Clearly, I'm gonna need a drink. You? She smiles and nods.You, stay here, yeah? Oliver moves to--Watch him OK? Oliver begins to leave his drinks. We see his POV of the woman dressed as Julius Rosenberg waiting on the couch. Oliver slips into one of his memories...Hello?Yeah.You did?Probably house music?So did you meet anyone? At the packed bar, Hal drinks alone.Would you like to dance? She happily nods yes. They walk to the dance floor, we think Oliver's going to be shy, but he breaks into a kinetic, angular, dance. She's surprised with us - she laughs, they have a good time.Hello... Shes mouths a silent \"hi\"...Can I give you my number? She pulls out her pad and pen and hands them to him.Thanks. As he writes, Oliver spies Arthur sitting in the corner of the bathroom, staring directly at him.I feel bad dragging Arthur to the party. I should get home. It was really nice meeting you. She writes on her pad: \"Au Revoir\"Hello? ON THE OTHER ENIs that you?One beep means yes?I've always wanted to have a phone call with someone who doesn't talk...You want to do something?Now?Okay, I'm parked just right up the street. BEEP. They hang up. Oliver is filled with hope. CUT TO: \"Julius\" walking out into a pool of street light. They smile at each other, but don't say anything. They get into his car.Okay. You point - I'll drive. Oliver starts the engine. She points forward and they head off. At the light she points left, he follows. Down the street she points right...This way?Nice place. They sit on her bed. She steals his pipe, put's it in her mouth -- writes on her pad and shows it to him.Oh, my mother. My mother died five years ago.Oh, you spoke.My father died two months ago, almost three. She looks at him with sincere empathy and surprise. Oliver's opened up, an now everything gushes out, he barely knows what he's saying.He, he was gay. She's very surprised.He was gay the whole time they were married.He came out after my mother died and, uh... he was 75 years old. There's a quiet moment of deep connection.Sorry. She mouths \"No\" . She reaches out and gently runs a finger across Oliver's brow and the outline of his face, he's so vulnerable, she lovingly/mischievously squishes his face together and messes up his hair. Then she leans in, and they kiss for the first time - delicately.Sure, sure. They lay down, she takes his arm and pulls him into spooning her. He pulls the covers over them.Oliver. She writes again: \"Go to NY. Audition. Back Thursday.\"How long are you here when you get back? Anna holds up one finger.A year? Anna shakes her head and smiles. She gestures smaller.A month? Right. And then?... She pantomimes a camera rolling, and herself acting.You're filming here. Acting.And after?... She makes a casual tossing motion with her hand.Just somewhere else. Where? Anna only shrugs. She writes more, and tosses the notepad on his lap. Oliver reads: \"Can I see you again?\" He's very happy.Yes.Hello house, hello Oliver.Jesus, Pop, you get so much mail. Oliver slows and stares at his father's magazine - The Advocate. Two attractive, shirtless men on the cover under the title: America's Sweethearts. Oliver's lost in memory...I'm sorry.Andy?The Brazilian ballet star is already known not only as a skilled partner, but also as a gifted and versatile dancer, who adeptly fields roles ranging... Camera tracks out of the room, leaving the two men alone...Yeah, yeah, he's eating.What was all that?I'm sorry. Moans and complaints from the group.What did you do with my father? He was so polite.Two, four, six, eight...I'm gonna meet her at her hotel again. You happy?Here's eight... Turns to Elliot.We haven't actually had a conversation yet, so, you know...And you know that because?It's true. It's embarrassing. I'm 38 and falling for a girl again...I don't feel like screaming... Georgia, never ruffled.What the fuck is that?Well, that's ridiculous.Well, its just copying something someone did, like, 30 years ago in the Bronx.How does it work?Historical consciousness... you know, something bigger than myself. Elliott scoffs.Let's do it again. Elliott drives off. Oliver's coming to life.Maybe we, we could, um, just talk for a second.This music's old.I'm Jewish right? Georgia comes and sits with him, caresses his hair as she talks with him.C'mon. Still embarrassed, Oliver takes Georgia's hand and walks her away from the guard.No.Camisole? Anna laughs.I was brought up by these animals and they didn't like questions. They're both smiling now.They were very frowned upon. So I had to guess. Anna takes this in.Anything? CUT TO: Oliver and Anna at the window.What's out there? She points.Yeah.Uh-huh.Right.How do you know so much about people?Oh yeah? She points at her blank face.No, that's not true.Yeah, you have blonde hair that goes down to about here. You smoke in non-smoking rooms. Oliver is still covering her eyes, leading her to a certain point, the busy sound of the freeway fading up...Okay, open your eyes... HIGH ANGLE on huge trucks and traffic racing just beneath Oliver and Anna's feet under the overpass. The trucks lay on their horns as they pass, scaring and thrilling them. MOMENTS LATER: they walk alongside the LA river together, arm in arm, happy. The intimate conversation continues in voice over.Yeah, you see, you don't know me at all.Someone flashy walks into your life and you're just gonna fall for it?No, uh, it doesn't work like that. There are other steps, it's complicated. They look at each other a beat and then walk on together.You know... I don't know.She was great.My situation?That's your fatherly advice? Personal ads?What?Jesus, Pop.I thought he was your boyfriend?Pop.Alright, come on. Come on. Oliver tries to clear the couch of books and dogs for Hal to sit down.Arthur, down.I'd wait for the lion. Oliver grabs the oxygen tubes and puts them on Hal's face.Hey, what did you get? She puts the cover of Liv Ullman's \"Changing\" over her face - Ullman's face on the cover becomes Anna's.Liv Ullman. Very serious.That's kind of a classic American thing. Anna opens the book to a large drawing of a couple having sex.Yeah, Like page 75?Or 75 all the way through, throughVeronica Lake.She was a pin-up model and a film star... Success was short-lived... series of broken marriages... She struggled with mental illness and alcoholism. She died of hepatitis at the age of 53.Yeah.It's really good. JUMP CUT: They're sitting on milk crates by the truck, ready to take their first bite, Anna dives in un-selfconsciously, we're not sure what she thinks.What do you think?It's good? Oh, I wasn't sure you'd like it.You're an actress and staying in that fancy hotel. Anna can barely swallow her huge bite...How do you keep hold of friends... or boyfriends?You can stay in the same place and still find ways to leave people. She reaches up with her hand, their fingers intertwine.Yeah, I guess so. The look to each other.Pop?What are you--? Pop. What?Prednisone makes you crazy.Pop, you should rest. Hal looks sick but energized, he shuffles his desk of papers.Nothing, you're pretty.Yeah.You're kidding right?She did not. Anna laughs. As Anna continues to explain, the sound begins to fade down...This is what it looks like when Anna tells me about being Jewish in 2003. And when I tell her that my mother was Jewish. And then my father turned in his gay badge when my mother turned in her Jewish badge. And they got married inMy mother didn't know she was Jewish until she was 13. It was 1938. This is what people looked like.And lions and giraffes. This man was Man of the Year.Her father tried to hide that they were Jewish. This is the swim team that asked her to leave once they discovered that she was Jewish.This is what pretty looked like inMy father realized he was gay when he was 13. It was 1938.This is what pretty looked like.This is the only place my father could hide and have sex in the Fifties.My father said if you got caught my the Vice Squad you could lose everything... This is everything.My father laid down on a couch like this and told the psychiatrist all his problems in 1955. The doctor told him that homosexuality was a mental illness, but it could be cured.Not everyone got cured.This is where my parents lived inAnd this is the home where the first gay rights group was secretly meeting.While they were reciting their vows, here in this church...Allen Ginsburg was writing his famous poem, Howl, blocks away in this room.Yeah. Right.Here, Pop.I know, I know. Come on. Hal begins taking his many pills, with each one he pings his glass with a teaspoon as he swallows. The room is cluttered with books. Oliver picks up a toppling pile of files from a paper-filled side table.Alright. Oliver begins to neaten a messy pile of books on top of a chair.But what about this chair? Is it gay?Pop, Pop, the cord won't go that far.Pop, you just got out of the hospital, you should take it easy.You need to tell Andy that you're... not well. Hal, continues on, avoiding looking at Oliver.Me?Hey. Oliver approaches seriously, this makes Andy nervous, he stops his workout. Oliver tries to find his words.Yeah?Hey, I don't have a problem with gay guys.No.I don't know Andy.Okay, okay.I couldn't tell him.No it's not. You can't hide this from him. He loves you.Just act natural. When he's not looking, we'll make a run for it, okay?He's that bad? She picks up the phone, and gestures for Oliver to pick up the line next to him.Oui? Anna continues to talk in a different voice.Oui Papa.Doing what?You should tell mom about that, not me. She just looks at him. Back into phone.Just as it was going so well.Hey Anna?How do you feel about vandalism? It's the last question she thought he'd ask. She's amused.You okay?Okay. Oliver walks out and writes big letters across the billboard.Yeah. He comes to her, wanting to get beyond the romance somehow.I'm trying to impress you.Arthur, Arthur. I'm sorry. We see the old man's face, it's not Hal, but it the resemblance hits Oliver too. The man is struggling with his hotel key card.Uh, do you mind? Oliver swipes the man's key, the door opens.Yeah. She wants to take care of him, she lays him back on the bed, helps him take his coat off, she's sitting on him, caressing him - Oliver is overwhelmed by memory.Somewhere along the line, he stopped admitting to himself that he was sick.He did a lot of shopping. Bought all these books.He was obsessed with Staples.He bought a lot of plants.He had a lot of parties.I thought I was making dinner?He had these political letter writing parties, there was an out gay congressman he was supporting...He started telling everyone that he was getting better. They're finally almost alone.Why're you telling them you're \"turning the corner\"?You have stage 4 cancer?Pop. There is no stage 5.What does it mean?What movie are we watching?Yeah I know who Harvey Milk is.He hired a secretary that he could dictate to.He wrote an essay about religion...You re-wrote Jesus' death? They all laugh.Anna?If this is too much, then we should just stop. Oliver gets up and starts to leave, Anna's surprised. She catches up with him puts her arms around him from behind.No!He talks to you too?Your English is not so perfect. And he said ten minutes.You okay? You did really well.You watching all the humans going around and around. The manager of the rink suddenly arrives, upset.If I leave him on his own, he loses all control.Yeah, but if I leave him in the car, he cries, he howls. I can't leave him in the car.She is just talking in French. She's saying it's OK, it is such a small dog.You're gonna call the authorities?Sorry, excuse us, sorry. They enter Anna's door.He shouldn't do this to you. The phone in the next room keeps ringing. He awkwardly skates to it and unplugs it. He returns.Your leaving soon?I think you should come to my house and move in with me.Yeah, a lot. She's very moved.Yes . She laughs. She almost cries as she thinks this over. She skates to him, puts her arms around him.But now I'm going to have to kill you for sure now.Cause I'm falling in love with you. The sound in the room fades down, Oliver's narration fades in over the shot of them embracing in their skates.This is what the sun looks like and the stars. This is what it looks like when we eat. When we tell each other the stories in our heads.I was born in 1965. Anna was born in 1971. This is what the sun looked like. Her pets. Her parents. She left home when she was 16. She lived here and here and here.She had three serious relationships. She left all of them. I had four serious relationships. I left them too. Or let them fall apart.We didn't know how we learned the stories in our heads but sometimes they stop running and I can really see Anna's eyes in 2003. Her ears. Her feet. This is what it looks like when she says, I love you, inThis is what it looks like when she cries. When she tells me there's always a new empty room waiting for her. They used to make her feel free. Now they make her feel the opposite of free.Next one.Yeah, everyone knows that, here. He gives Hal another pill, another reluctant difficult swallow, another ping.Everyone knows about that Pop.No, I just thought you and mom weren't in love.But you were gay that whole time.For 44 years?What about sex? You guys had sex?And mom? You wanted mom too right? Frustrated and angry, Oliver takes the pill tray into the kitchen, leaving Hal behind.Sex.Life.Healing.Sunlight.Spirit.The first Gay Pride flag was made in 1978 by a man named Gilbert Baker. He gave a meaning to each color.This man was President. This was invented, this is what movies looked like. Pets.On November 27th, 1978. Harvey Milk was shot and killed.One week later, my father opened his annual Museum Christmas Exhibit. He collected stuffed animals from people in the community, and put them on display. My father printed a quote from The Velveteen Rabbit in large type on the wall......'It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't happen to people who break easily......Generally by the time you are real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints. But these things don't matter at all because you are real and you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.'\" The music blares as Arthur greets Oliver. Hal comes to Oliver, Andy continues to dance.Yeah? Is that a good idea? Hal hugs Oliver.This is the idea, is that it's the history of sadness. Oliver spreads out an impossible long CD panel design.Here, this could be your... The panels go on and on.Your gonna need a big CD box. JUMP CUT: Later, Oliver's still trying to talk the band into his idea. Four billion years ago, Earth begins. And the idea is that sadness has not been created yet. JUMP CUT: Oliver and the RECORD COMPANY REP now alone.I'm sorry.Well, that went well.Come on Arthur.This is the living room. He leads her into the dining room.Dining room. Oliver points to a photo of his parents when they were in their 50's.There are my parents. My mom. Hal, Georgia, this is Anna - Anna - Hal, Georgia. Anna's overwhelmed feeling increases, she continues to try to roll with it.These're the stairs.They go up.I emptied these for you. I'll get your case.Are you okay? She want's to be, she hides it all by initiating sex with him, physical and fast.Are you?Why were you crying yesterday? They're miles apart.Yeah.Well are you happy here?I don't know Anna. I don't think this is what I am supposed to feel like. Anna looks crushed and surprised.I can barely remember you from when I was little.Let's go home. CUT TO: Oliver and Georgia heading away through the gallery.Let's go. Oliver pulls her away before she starts any more trouble.Anna? Where where you?Hey.Okay? Thanks. Elliott closes the door. Oliver heads back to his car and Arthur's howling begins. It's an incredibly sad and desperate howl. Oliver gets to his car, the howling doesn't stop, Oliver can't ignore it. Oliver get's out of the car, heads back to house to get Arthur.Hey. Look I'm so sorry... But I'm, I'm at your front door. I'm in New York. Anna, still in bed, sits up and feels something.You, you're in LA? Anna laughs, but is touched.You said you were coming here?!Fuck. I'm in your building. Anna laughs.Okay, I'm inside. Wow, there's like nothing here.Maybe because I, I don't really believe that it's gonna work. And then I make sure it doesn't work.Great. You look great.Once you make the call, you have less than an hour before two men come and place the body into a bag.You will need to make copies and send them to cancel every credit card, phone account, utility, gym membership, every insurance policy, mortgage, to settle their taxes.You will have all their mail forwarded to your address. You will write their obituary. You run it with a photo in the paper for two dollars a word. You will wonder if it's right. You'll throw a lot of their stuff away. You'll bring a lot of their stuff to your house. This is the photo my mother kept in her bedroom.When I was a kid I thought that was my arm giving her daisies. Now I make a new mistake and think it's her arm giving me the daisies, saying, here, here's simple and happy. That's what I meant to give you.Hey.Arthur... Oliver picks him up, he gets all of Arthur's stuff, he's a little cold to Andy.Thank you... Thanks.What?No. No, it's because my father loved you so much. This hits Andy hard. Oliver turns to leave but can't. He turns back, goes to Andy and they hug.Arthur... hey. Hey, how've you been?Hey. She's a bit tentative, but she's here and happy.Come in, come in. Arthur runs up and Anna bends down to greet him. They missed each other. Anna walks in and Oliver follows.Yeah.Sure.Chest...I like giving and getting rubdowns and then going into mutual soft stuff. They both smile.What happens now?How does that work? They look at each other, they smile.", "clean_line": "yeah yeah coming live arthur looks car arthur hops dining room people come eat dog listens intently oliver moves dog follows living room bathroom

Oliver rushes and helps him.You two married?Why not? She's great. The nurse smiles, embarrassed, and continues with her job.You always have some very good reason, haven't you?Yeah, alright. Give me the flashlight. Oliver opens it, they look at a few pages together, photos of serene gardens.Oh, that's nice.Oh, yeah? Hal continues to direct the light across the room, we follow the circle of light as it moves a cross a wall landing on a painting.Oh, who did that painting?A--, and these?But how do they relate to the exhibit?Well, its beautiful.Putting the Japanese gardens there. It's just beautiful.Andy! Andy gets on the bed opposite Oliver. He gives Hal a big kiss on the lips. Hal glows. Oliver backs away slowly. Andy picks up Hal's hand, turns it palm up and presses his face into it.Oh, God. Andy pushes play, on the recording we hear Andy's voice:Oliver?I'm not sorry I woke you! I went to Akbar tonight.They had wonderfully loud music. In- sit, in-sit, in-sit. What kind of music is that?\"House music.\"Young gay men don't go for older gay men.You have it easy.But...?Uh-huh. I see.No. Thank you. As the doctor leaves. Oliver takes his father's hand.Well, let's not rush out and tell everyone.No need to get him up a tree. Hal takes a moment and composes himself. In his eyes we can see that he knows there is an end to his life.Can you read me something?But is he eating?Oh God, I worry so much about-- As Andy enters, his hands mysteriously cupped together.Oh here we are... Andy shows Hal his cupped hands.What have you got in there?Oh, Andy, you can't bring that kind of thing in here.Fuck you. Oliver watches with amusement. NURSE SOPHIA enters...It's time for inspection... The nurse works her way between Andy and Hal to take his pulse.Hello. Andy feels interrupted, strangely hurt by the nurse. The nurse begins to take Hal's vital signs.Go take a walk. Calm yourself. Andy walks out, feeling embarrassed and rejected.Oh, Andy hasn't had it easy. Be nice to him. To everyone's surprise, Andy storms back in with a bouquet of flowers, dumps them on Hal's chest, kisses him triumphantly and leaves again.Andy, where did you get these?Oh, it's not? She shakes her head no, the party stops, she leaves. Oliver instinctively polite, starts packing up their cups.No, no, no. She's a wonderful nurse. Here's to health care. Hal swigs back his wine. They all laugh, grab their cups and toast.Oh, I invited him - but he never returns my calls. The guys drink merrily. Someone shoves a cup into Oliver's hand, pours him a drink.What happened with Michelle?She seemed great.Maybe you should take out a personal ad, where you explain your situation?Yeah, I mean, you want to be in a relationship but you can't stay in one.Well, a lot of people use them... I did.If Andy wasn't going to be monogamous, why should I be?Jesus yourself.Hello house Hello Hal. Andy holds Arthur. Hal and Arthur kiss. They've clearly missed each other. JUMP CUTS: Oliver takes bottles of pills and syrups and inhalers out of a Sav-On bag. He makes a chart of the medicine, the dosage, and puts the pills in a dish. It's emotional job for him.Oh God, what have you got this time?No, no, no, you don't have a green caterpillar.Oh my God. Gross! Oh, Jesus...Hey, you going?Oh. Right. Andy waves goodbye and leaves. Hal is sad but covering it up. He catches Oliver watching.Well, at least I'm the number one boyfriend. Hal grimaces in pain, doubles over.Oh, my stomach.Well, let's say, when you were little, you always dreamed of some day getting a lion? Oliver eases Hal down onto the couch.And you wait and you wait and you wait and you wait and the lion doesn't come. Then along comes a giraffe. Oliver helps Hal get his feet up.You can be alone or you can be with the giraffe.That's why I worry about you. Hal looks at Oliver with love and concern.You want me to be with someone like me. I like Andy cause he's not like me... he's fun.Oh, did I wake you? Yeah. Thank you Maria. And now that you're here, uh, would you please put those up there?I'm reorganizing.I'm just not sleepy. I feel great.As soon as I finish these papers. Right, papers? Right, Hal. As soon as you're done, you can rest. Oliver can only sit and worry.Oh, God.Hey, no, no, no. That's the Gay Pride Day stuff. Just leave those.And that's for gay book club. You better leave those too.The chair's not gay. Obviously. Hal gets up and walks to the kitchen, his oxygen cannon cord is attached to the pump behind him, stopping him short.Oh, to hell with it. Hal pulls off the oxygen and keeps walking, frail but determined. Andy enters with a large pilates ball.Oh, hey what's that?That's a great idea.Yeah, later on, I'm gonna make myself some tea.Your mother's vase needs some flowers. Oliver looks at them frustrated and uneasy...You'll tell him, won't you? Oliver's flabbergasted, but his dad's vulnerability is clear to him.Please?That's okay.For someone with so much relationship advice, you seem awfully alone. Oliver, angry but at a loss for words, takes the flower vase and leaves, Arthur follows.Oliver, this is Blake. He's a wonderful man. CU of the small round registration tattoos on Hal's chestLook. I finally got a tattoo. Registration purposes of course.Well, glad you could make it.It's movie night. Oliver and Hal make their way through a crowd of Hal's gay friends. They're in party mode.Oh, I'm turning the corner on this thing. We loose Hal and Oliver in the group...Well...It's not as bad as it sounds.That's not what it means.It just means it's been through 3 other stages. Oliver doesn't know what to say, he looks through the door at all of Hal's friends -- happy, laughing, partying. He looks back at Hal, ready to fight him more, but for the first time we can see fear and doubt in Hal's face.\"The Life of Harvey Milk.\" He was the first openly gay politician...Good, good.Eventually Jesus grew old. He could no longer walk far and he could no longer preach in a loud voice. One day he announced to his apostles that he was departing. The three disciples prayed with him, gave him water, bathed and fed him. After gasping for breath for several days, one morning, just as dawn came, Jesus passed away.It was so violent, we need new stories. Oliver goes over and kisses Hal on the head.Again!Lord. With each swallow he pings a glass with a fork. Hal opens a letter from a gay rights organization, he hands Oliver the rainbow sticker we just saw.Here, that means gay pride.No they don't.Don't be ridiculous. Hal's hiding something, he doesn't look Oliver in the eyes when he asks...Did you know, about me? Oliver shakes his head no.We loved each other.I learned how not to be.I knew I was gay, though, at dinner parties I was looking at the husbands not the wives.I couldn't have survived if I didn't know that. I just chose not to follow those instincts.She didn't think I was the greatest lover, but we made do. Look, I liked my life, the museum, our house, that's what I wanted.Yes, stop that.She proposed to me you know. This draws Oliver back into the room.I said - look I love you and we're great buddies but you know what I am. And then she says, that doesn't matter. I'll fix that. Oliver's never heard this part of the story before.Andy's moving in.Just be happy about it. Oliver can't just be happy about it.Have I done something wrong?I see.You did an excellent job Dr. Long. Thank you... for... For coming to the party. Oliver's devastated.You always wanted to hold my hand when you were little. I couldn't, you know. I was afraid it would look funny. I wanted to be close, you know and my father certainly was never close with me. God, I hope I wasn't like that.I guess I was at work.Isn't Juan's hair wonderful.Well it's terrific.Oh, no.I don't think so.How do you do it?Is that it? Hal looks into camera which is Oliver's POV.How do I look? Oliver's filled with love, happiness, regret.", "clean_line": "gay camera angle hal looking camera jump cut wearing robe gay angle continue jump cut hal talking camera cut different clothes cut line different inflection gay jump cut new outfit loved mother uh want explore jump cut new outfit want theoretically gay want new outfit inflection want new outfit inflection want oliver help ropes oliver rushes helps married great nurse smiles embarrassed continues job good reason haven yeah alright flashlight oliver opens look pages photos serene gardens oh nice oh yeah hal continues direct light room follow circle light moves cross wall landing painting oh painting relate exhibit beautiful putting japanese gardens beautiful andy andy gets bed opposite oliver gives hal big kiss lips hal glows oliver backs away slowly andy picks hal hand turns palm presses face oh god andy pushes play recording hear andy voice oliver sorry woke went akbar tonight wonderfully loud music sit sit sit kind music house music young gay men older gay men easy uh huh thank doctor leaves oliver takes father hand let rush tell need tree hal takes moment composes eyes knows end life read eating oh god worry andy enters hands mysteriously cupped oh andy shows hal cupped hands got oh andy bring kind thing fuck oliver watches amusement nurse sophia enters time inspection nurse works way andy hal pulse hello andy feels interrupted strangely hurt nurse nurse begins hal vital signs walk calm andy walks feeling embarrassed rejected oh andy hasn easy nice surprise andy storms bouquet flowers dumps hal chest kisses triumphantly leaves andy oh shakes head party stops leaves oliver instinctively polite starts packing cups wonderful nurse health care hal swigs wine laugh grab cups toast oh invited returns calls guys drink merrily shoves cup oliver hand pours drink happened michelle great maybe personal ad explain situation yeah mean want relationship stay lot people use andy wasn going monogamous jesus hello house hello hal andy holds arthur hal arthur kiss ve clearly missed jump cuts oliver takes bottles pills syrups inhalers sav bag makes chart medicine dosage puts pills dish emotional job oh god got time green caterpillar oh god gross oh jesus hey going oh right andy waves goodbye leaves hal sad covering catches oliver watching number boyfriend hal grimaces pain doubles oh stomach let little dreamed day getting lion oliver eases hal couch wait wait wait wait lion come comes giraffe oliver helps hal feet giraffe worry hal looks oliver love concern want like like andy cause like fun oh wake yeah thank maria uh reorganizing sleepy feel great soon finish papers right papers right hal soon rest oliver sit worry oh god hey gay pride day stuff leave gay book club better leave chair gay obviously hal gets walks kitchen oxygen cannon cord attached pump stopping short oh hell hal pulls oxygen keeps walking frail determined andy enters large pilates ball oh hey great idea yeah later gonna tea mother vase needs flowers oliver looks frustrated uneasy ll tell won oliver flabbergasted dad vulnerability clear okay relationship advice awfully oliver angry loss words takes flower vase leaves arthur follows oliver blake wonderful man cu small round registration tattoos hal chestlook finally got tattoo registration purposes course glad movie night oliver hal way crowd hal gay friends party mode oh turning corner thing loose hal oliver group bad sounds means means stages oliver know looks door hal friends happy laughing partying looks hal ready fight time fear doubt hal face life harvey milk openly gay politician good good eventually jesus grew old longer walk far longer preach loud voice day announced apostles departing disciples prayed gave water bathed fed gasping breath days morning dawn came jesus passed away violent need new stories oliver goes kisses hal head lord swallow pings glass fork hal opens letter gay rights organization hands oliver rainbow sticker saw means gay pride ridiculous hal hiding look oliver eyes asks know oliver shakes head loved learned knew gay dinner parties looking husbands wives couldn survived know chose follow instincts think greatest lover look liked life museum house wanted yes stop proposed know draws oliver room said look love great buddies know says matter ll fix oliver heard story andy moving happy oliver happy wrong excellent job dr long thank coming party oliver devastated wanted hold hand little couldn know afraid look funny wanted close know father certainly close god hope wasn like guess work isn juan hair wonderful terrific oh think hal looks camera oliver pov look oliver filled love happiness regret"}, "ANNA": {"raw_line": "Oh merd.He's sweet. He misses your Dad. She stops. Gets up, nervous, and walks past Oliver into the next room. Oliver follows her in. They pause uncomfortably, Anna suddenly leans in and kisses him. Before it goes to far...Right. They awkwardly break apart. Anna goes to a chair, Oliver follows. While nothing has really been expressed between the two, Anna seems to understand the problem.Well, my name is Anna. You're worried you can't trust me because you don't know who I am. I get it. That makes sense to me. She falters, looks at him vulnerably. Oliver abruptly kisses her. She pushes back. They pause. She traces his brow slowly with her index finger, the way she did their first night.Can you toss me my camisole. Oliver throws a sweater.No, my camisole. She throws the sweater back at him. Oliver looks around helplessly. He grabs a flower out of a vase and hands it to her.You don't know what a camisole is?You can ask me anything.That's a tree.And cars.Another building like this one.People in the building like us. Half of them think things will never work out. The other half believe in magic. It's like a war between them. Oliver smiles. He moves away from the window.Oh. Well, you have to learn how to read their faces. She climbs onto his lap, straddles him.For example... here is mad. Anna passes her hand across her face, and she's \"mad\".Happy... Her hand passes again and she's \"happy\".Sometimes its just nothing.This is nothing... And they are good at looking one way and being another way. Her playfulness is very meaningful to Oliver, he's in love.You don't know me. I like that.Oh yeah?Oh yeah? You drive on the sidewalk. You were raised by animals. Sometimes you look very alone, like you just got here. They meet up with friends on the banks of the river.And I found this crazy book. She holds an old copy of THE JOY OF SEX in front of her face.Maybe we can figure out some classic American things to do. Oliver takes the book and flips through the pages.Uh-huh.Oh I love her.All these actor stories end sad. I can tell you that already. It's not a good life. Oliver closes the book, they share a look, and something vulnerable. Anna changes the mood, pulls out The Joy Of Sex, skips through the pages as she talks.So. Now I want real Mexican food. She stops on an illustration she likes.And I want to try page... 46.No.Really?It's so good. Oliver's so relieved.Why?I like this place.I used to love hotels. But now I'm always in a new apartment or... in another hotel somewhere.It makes it very easy to end up alone - to leave people.You are like that? Its what you do? Oliver nods yes. They know each other much better than either one knew.So we are the same?What?No...Jewish girls are not pretty. They can be \"interesting\", or cute, but not pretty.That's what my mom told me.No, you're right, this girl at school told me that. And I went home and my mom said, `Anna, who told you that? And Oliver's narration fades in over them walking...Don't, don't. It keeps ringing.It's my dad. They both watch the phone as it rings and stops.I'll be my dad, you be me.Honey? She gestures again, Oliver picks up the phone on his side of the bed. Anna turns away, he can only see her back across the bed. He turns away too.C'est toi, cheri?You never call me back.You know, I can't stop thinking about, you know, about it. Doing it.Killing myself. You are the only one I can tell that to. Oliver breaks role, turns around looks at her.You are my girl. They hang up. She's embarrassed, she lightens the mood to get out of this intimacy.Now I have to kill you.I know. I'm sorry. She tosses a pillow over his face and pretends to shoot him twice. She pulls the pillow back tentatively, he's smiling.Hey Oliver?I don't know. Pretty okay.Yeah. I'm gonna stay here with my new friend .C'est beau ici.Really? She walks to him and puts her hands around his head, somehow it's more intimate and vulnerable now.It's working. They kiss. MOMENTS LATER. They're at the bottom of the ladder. They all run back to their car.He looked like your dad?Good for him.Stay here. She starts to close the door, Arthur scratches, she tries again, he scratches. She opens the door, Arthur trots out into the hallway - Anna catches up with him.I couldn't sleep, I wanted to walk around... Oliver's petting Arthur. He's confused and hurt.You've lost so much. What if I can't make up for that?Wait, wait. She forces him to stay there.I don't want to stop. They hold this pose in silence for a beat, then, surprisingly, he hoists her over his shoulder, and carries her back to their room. She laughs, they've made it past this trouble.Ah, you're awake! Arthur says it's time to get up, he says he has the day off.Yeah.Dans ce pays! On ne peut pas amener un chien. On peut rien faire. Mais c'est con...Even if we don't answer, he's still in here .I go somewhere else, he's still here. Oliver can relate.Yeah.Would you want a strange girl like me?Do you cook?I would love that. They kiss.Why?Hello.Yeah?You OK?I was nervous, and excited. I kept thinking, maybe I'm not so lost.You okay?You seem so unhappy with me.Maybe I'm not perfect at it. I don't really know what I'm doing... but I want to be here. He's silent, distant, confused. She's hurt by his silence and mistrust and leaves.Okay. I will go back to New York then. She gets up to go.Hey.I'm in Los Angeles. Oliver's flabbergasted she's not behind the door.Yeah, but I didn't leave.Okay. See the window? Near the radiator? Oliver looks around and sees the radiator - goes to look.There is a hide-a-key behind it.No. Oliver moves forward into the kitchen.This is my kitchen. It's where I eat. Oliver follows her tour, while she's not there, it's strangely intimate.This is my bathroom. It's very fancy. The bare, poor bathroom is not fancy.Outside my window...... That's my neighbor's roof. The room at the end is my bedroom...That's my closet. Those are my clothes and my pictures. There is a single rack holding up some clothes. Her pictures are taped to the wall. Oliver sits on her bed.Why do you leave everyone? Why did you let me go? Oliver thinks for a moment.Hey.The living room. She heads to the dinning room.Dining room... Oliver laughs nervously. In the dining room, Hal's old boxes are still stacked along the walls. Oliver leans forward and pulls something out of a box. She looks at a personal ad application, with the picture of Hal in the open jean jacket we saw at the beginning of the film.Oh. Crazy picture...Can I read it?I'm looking for sex with the hope it turns into friendship or a relationship. But I don't insist on monogamy.I'm an old senior guy, 78, but I'm attractive and horny. I'm an art historian, now retired. MORE REPEAT SHOTS: Hal with Andy at the L.A. Pride picnic, Hal playing with Arthur on his couch.And in addition to art, I like houses, gardens, parties, and walking with my Jack Russell. I'm 5'11\", 160 pounds. I'm trim, gray hair, blue eyes, hairy cheest.I have a nice house with food, drinks, friends and me. If you are willing to try an older guy, let's meet and see what happens. She looks at the photo again.He didn't give up. They look at each other, more vulnerable and willing than we've seen them.I don't know.", "clean_line": "oh merd sweet misses dad stops gets nervous walks past oliver room oliver follows pause uncomfortably anna suddenly leans kisses goes far right awkwardly break apart anna goes chair oliver follows expressed anna understand problem anna worried trust know makes sense falters looks vulnerably oliver abruptly kisses pushes pause traces brow slowly index finger way night toss camisole oliver throws sweater camisole throws sweater oliver looks helplessly grabs flower vase hands know camisole ask tree cars building like people building like half think things work half believe magic like war oliver smiles moves away window oh learn read faces climbs lap straddles example mad anna passes hand face mad happy hand passes happy good looking way way playfulness meaningful oliver love know like oh yeah oh yeah drive sidewalk raised animals look like got meet friends banks river crazy book holds old copy joy sex face maybe figure classic american things oliver takes book flips pages uh huh oh love actor stories end sad tell good life oliver closes book share look vulnerable anna changes mood pulls joy sex skips pages talks want real mexican food stops illustration likes want try page good oliver relieved like place love hotels new apartment hotel makes easy end leave people like oliver nods yes know better knew jewish girls pretty interesting cute pretty mom told right girl school told went home mom said anna told oliver narration fades walking keeps ringing dad watch phone rings stops ll dad honey gestures oliver picks phone bed anna turns away bed turns away est toi cheri know stop thinking know killing tell oliver breaks role turns looks girl hang embarrassed lightens mood intimacy kill know sorry tosses pillow face pretends shoot twice pulls pillow tentatively smiling hey oliver know pretty okay yeah gonna stay new friend est beau ici walks puts hands head intimate vulnerable working kiss moments later ladder run car looked like dad good stay starts close door arthur scratches tries scratches opens door arthur trots hallway anna catches couldn sleep wanted walk oliver petting arthur confused hurt ve lost wait wait forces stay want stop hold pose silence beat surprisingly hoists shoulder carries room laughs ve past trouble ah awake arthur says time says day yeah dans ce pays ne peut pas amener chien peut rien faire mais est answer oliver relate yeah want strange girl like cook love kiss hello yeah ok nervous excited kept thinking maybe lost okay unhappy maybe perfect know want silent distant confused hurt silence mistrust leaves okay new york gets hey los angeles oliver flabbergasted door yeah leave okay window near radiator oliver looks sees radiator goes look hide key oliver moves forward kitchen kitchen eat oliver follows tour strangely intimate bathroom fancy bare poor bathroom fancy outside window neighbor roof room end bedroom closet clothes pictures single rack holding clothes pictures taped wall oliver sits bed leave let oliver thinks moment hey living room heads dinning room dining room oliver laughs nervously dining room hal old boxes stacked walls oliver leans forward pulls box looks personal ad application picture hal open jean jacket saw beginning film oh crazy picture read looking sex hope turns friendship relationship insist monogamy old senior guy attractive horny art historian retired repeat shots hal andy pride picnic hal playing arthur couch addition art like houses gardens parties walking jack russell pounds trim gray hair blue eyes hairy cheest nice house food drinks friends willing try older guy let meet happens looks photo look vulnerable willing ve seen know"}}}
