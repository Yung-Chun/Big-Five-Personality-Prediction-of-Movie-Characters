Look at this--Look what they did...I saw what they did, on our soil, and--Yes, sir. But I can't see myself on a ship. I'd wanna be in the fight--I ain't much of a swimmer-- 11.I'm not most men, sir. I don't quit.30, sir.No, sir.I love water, hooyah.Two hundred.No, sir. 13.--and when I told her the condom broke she started crying and begging me to do something. And I'm a virgin, I don't know what to do, but I'd heard if you pour Coke up there you won't get pregnant-- So we went to 7-11, got a liter of Coke and drove back into the woods. She took her panties off and did a handstand against a tree but when I start pouring, she starts screaming, \"it stings, it stings\" but when I'd stop, she'd scream \"no don't stop\" and it's fizzing out and--I'm gonna try and get into sniper school.I can hunt. And what's cooler than being a sniper?It could be the leather pants.Corduroy.Only thing that happens to me after three beers is a fourth.I'm no redneck, I'm a Texan.We ride horses, they ride their cousins.I polish dolphins. They have to be polished in captivity or their skin disintegrates.To be honest, you look a little sad.So am I tall enough to buy you a drink?How about this: one shot, one answer.I'm just finishing BUD/S.That was two questions...What's that mean you know all about us?How can you say we're self-centered? I'd lay down my life for my country.Cause it's the greatest country on earth and I believe it's worth protecting. I'm sorry this guy hurt your sister but that's not me. Nice talking to you.You said you'd never date a SEAL, so I'm going home.Well in that case... what's your name?Nice to meet you, Taya. I'm Chris Kyle.Our instructors say our biggest enemies are ego, liquor, and women.It's me again. The guy whose shoes you puked on? I was thinking maybe you didn't get my last message. Or the one before that. So, I figured-- 20.I wanted to be a cowboy-- but I did that and I felt like I was meant for more.I rescued that bar from you.Do you like country music?You want kids? 21.That's a shitty thing to tell a girl.But those wrong picks put you here. They made you who you are. And I like who you are.I don't know... I just pray I can do my job if that day comes.Check. I'm dialed for windage.You're trembling...We don't have to do this...If I close my off-eye I can't see what's out there.Negative. There's something--There it is.I know enough. You're a package deal, babe.What are you afraid of?I'm going to marry you, and we're going to start a family.I love you. I'm done. 24.Would you believe me if I told you I was painted green and on an IV two hours ago? 25.Package deal babe.They say it'll be over in 6 weeks.Don't be afraid. It's all part of the plan.I'm not the only one going to war.A sniper won't aim for your head.They got sniping in the Olympics now?You ever hunt?You just got your first kill, Goat.I'm going to the roof. You stay here and be on the lookout for farm animals.Get the fuck off me.That was sniper fire. Shooter is on our side of Elizabeth street. Over.That sniper walked right up our ass.My shooter statements are on the dresser.Should be eight. Two got dragged off. Something wrong?They still got one of our guys. 35.Where is everybody?Why ain't you out there?You still read comic books?This kid didn't even have hair on his balls and his mom hands him a grenade-- sends him running off to kill Marines.It was evil, man. That was hate like I've never seen it before.I know.It's just not how you imagine the first one going down.The other ones-- were righteous. Like God was blowing on my bullets.By every kill, do you mean just our kills or you're monitoring the bad guys too? 37.Sorry, was that a question?I got a armed military-aged male moving tactically with a car battery. Maybe he needs a jump?Well, I don't know what a Koran looks like but I can describe what he was carrying-- it was pressed metal, fired 7.62s and looked just like an AK-47.That's not how the call-home goes, babe.There are things we can't say over the phone.I can't stop thinking about that pink silky thing you wore on our honeymoon...Yeah--It was a good three days. I miss you bad.Yeah. But I got my gun in one hand and the phone in the other--You're horny preggers.You could be 300 pounds I'd still do you.How's my boy?I can't wait to see the way you are with him. You're gonna be incredible. 40.I just know. I can see it.I haven't checked any email.What happened?Taya.What happened to jump school? I thought--Deployed where? Where's he going?These Marines rush in like they been doing, they'll get their asses shot off.So let's coach them up. I'll show them how Team Guys do it and lead a unit in the street.But if I was down in the street--I just wanna get the bad guys. And I can't shoot them if I can't see `em.They're not--You said that AQI sniper was in the Olympics-- but Iraq hasn't qualified a shooter in the last three games.Once you make entry I can't see shit, so keep it slow and push through the target.Fuck this-- I'm going down to clear houses with the Marines. You coming?If I don't see you down there, you make sure I don't see you again.You wanna be a sniper? Swap me guns.I'll roll with you guys if that's cool?It's 32. But who's counting.Down. Down! On the floor, now!I will fucking shoot you! Down! Get down--You were ordered to evacuate. Why are you still here?Who will know we've spoken? 46.Bring the other guys in.Who is he? I need a name.So he's some kind of enforcer?We want Zarqawi. Where do we find Zarqawi?How do we find him?We don't even have proof this guy exists.I'm sorry. I want to help you. I do. But I need names, places, phone numbers--Give me a name, Sheik. Give me something.Yes sir, it does.Or he could be upset The Butcher cut off his wife's hand. Either way, seems like you'd wanna explore it.But you don't know his real name or you'd have it written up there. 49.If we're going back out, TEAM 3 could pull security--Why didn't you? 50.My kind of preacher.Minaret, 11 o'clock!You got eyes on that?Eyes on The Butcher. He's got that Sheikh's kid in the street--Fuck!--I'm gonna pop smoke for cover but don't move till I say.Hold.Holding! Hold...Move now. Go--Cause I'd wait.Go around. I'll go high.We need to work up a squad to pursue him.What do you mean?Can he do that? Just shelf us like that? I ship home in three weeks.Shh. I'm know. I'm so sorry.You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.Our bedroom.If it catches the light...They're mine. I swear...I'm nervous too.I am... What if that little alien reaches out and grabs me?Huh?--Maybe we just relax here?Not really.I'm just happy to be home.If you wanna help, you should be looking at my knees. I don't know what I did but--No, ma'am.Only when I'm thirsty.Is that high?I'll look into it. Thanks doc.You sabotaged me back there.It is okay. I'm fine.Babe, I'm driving down the freeway, it's sunny and 72 degrees. I'm fine. But there are people dying over there and I look around and it's like it's not even happening. It's barely on the news, no one talks about it. No one cares. And if I stay too long I'll forget about it too.We're at war and I'm headed to the mall.I don't belong here. I can't help anybody-Oh shit--I'm going back.My little man...Look at our boy. Look what we did. I love you, baby. We made it--This sniper is recording his kills. Mustafa. They sell these in the street.I don't want you thinking about it. I don't need you worrying.No, it's not. They're savages.They're fuckin savages.Can you give me a second--?You okay? Jeff?--I'm proud of you. You hear me?Dad too. He's proud of you.What?You guys know how I hate this shit so shut your traps. Our target is Amir Khalaf Fanus aka The Butcher. We'll be heading in under cover of darkness, sector P13, north of the river--Breacher-up.Tell em they won't be leaving till we do-- Ask if they seen him.Let's keep eyes on it get pictures of anyone coming and going.What do we got?Sixteen?He still inside?You got a problem? I didn't promote myself.Hash out tactics. We go at zero-dark. And Big Giggles is making the coffee.Tell him that's very generous of him.Tell him he's gonna be shipped off for detention and the Iraqi courts can decide what to do with him-- or he can help us get inside that restaurant down there.It's his choice. Tell him.We have eyes on the target. Flushing them out the back--Help him--They're coming back up! Watch your six--Pull back! Loading--Contact. Eyes on The Butcher. 12 o'clock.Dauber? You got visual? Confirm. 74.He's on the move. Crossing!I offered his father detention. I gave him a choice--It's not over.I don't know...Hey, some help here-- She's crying--You don't get to choose, bubba.You get what it gives you. That's how this thing works.Don't do this. Get up. Come on--Get off the floor. Right now--That's me.Did I--?Yeah. Right. Well, you Marines saved our ass plenty out there. How you holding up?Did you lose some friends?Yeah, I-- I'm sorry to hear that.We have the rest of our lives for that.We can wait. They can't.Here?You want some savage's ring? What if it's a blood diamond?Not for a rock.Ease off, don't get too close. You gonna tell her where it came from?The Butcher has his peepers out.I coulda taken him in that alley if I didn't have to save your ass--Is it just me? Or other guys too?Get me a shot, grandma.What the fuck!? How'd he survive--We're headed to the roof. Secure the van.He didn't--So much for him having my horseshoe. 85.She'll take it to Zales and try to find out how much your spent.They're all like that.No!--Biggles is down. Man down. No, buddy. No! Stay with me-- 86.Cover! I need cover. He's picking us off.You got nothing to be sorry for. I shouldn't have had us up there--Coulda been any of us. Just hang on-- 87.Don't die, Ryan. You hold on--He was 1000 meters out. Only one enemy sniper makes that shot.We're going back.For Biggles.Some stronghold. Move.You sure we got the right address--Marc--An AQI informant called in a tip. Biggles had just been shot. We were operating off emotion and-- we walked into an ambush.But that's not what killed him. That letter did. That letter killed Marc. He let go and he paid the price for it. 92.If something ever happened to me-- you'd meet someone else. You'd be alright.No.I do it for you. To protect you.Without this, there's nothing.I could never live with myself.I know.Hey, buddy--I'm right here just give me a minute-- Just blind as a bat, huh?That's good. Your face always needed a little fixing.I heard you proposed? Did you tell Kelly the diamond was from Zales?Nice.No she's not. How can you say that? She's getting you. All four inches.You're probably right.Is that what they say?The bad guys fled up into to Sadr City.We're gonna wall `em in and hunt `em down.Yes I do. You're my brother and they're going to pay for what they did to you.Any other Punishers here?Teams and shit.I know. I visited him before I left. That fucker can't see shit.Don't do it----please God--How deep?Is it Mustafa?What was that--No-- It came from behind us. We went the wrong way. He's south of the wall.I got something. 1900 yards out.Correction. 2100 yards out.It's him.This is Charlie 7 Bravo. We have eyes on the target. Initiate QRF. Over.He has eyes on our guys.Aim small. Aim small.For Biggles.There are two ways onto the roof. We cover both stairways and conserve ammo.Conserve--Do it. Call in our coordinates.--you got four rounds.Hey baby--I'm ready to come home. I'm ready...--I'm coming home. Can you hear me?Go, go, let's move--Stryker-3, what's your location--Hold there! We are 30 seconds out-- Go. Straight ahead. Go----hello?Yeah, I got out early.I'm here, I'm stateside.I guess I just needed a minute.Yeah, I know... Me too. I'm coming.Yeah. I'm good.Okay.That's not me.I was just protecting my guys. They were trying to kill our soldiers and-- I'm willing to stand before my creator and answer for every shot I took. The thing that haunts me are all the guys I couldn't save.How's it feel?I heard you had a nice boot collection before the war and--We gotta take care of our own.Get `em up, lil' lady. Hands in the air.Tell it to the judge.We could lock the doors. They can't get out of the yard.You're worth fighting for.Yes, ma'am. Right up the middle.I meant what I said about locking the doors.Not for four minutes.It'll take half that. Then I got two minutes leftover just to look at you.This Marine. His mom does parking at school and she asked for my help.I gotta go do something but when I get back, okay? But you have to let me win.I should get going...Look after our women, Bubba.
