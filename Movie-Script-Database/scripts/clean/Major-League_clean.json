If you were gonna pull this shit, you could've at least said you were from the Yankees.By the way, you were with me last night. Who's this girl on top of me?Tolbert? Tolbert? Screw it.Tolbert.Hello.Oh yeh, Charlie, look, I'm sorry about this morning...Sure.Oh hell, yeh, I work out every day.Luis, I'm not gonna be playin' anymore. I got a tryout in the States.But I changed at the motel.What happened to the private rooms?Jake Taylor.So, you just gonna settle for toilet brush, or you got another name?Forget about Dorn. He's always a little tough on rookies. You'll get a lot worse from other teams.Jake Taylor. Rick Vaughn.Great. Never been better.No problem.Around the league they're wrong.Yeh. Would I bullshit about somethin' like that?Sorry, Lou, I wasn't quite expectin' that much octane.Shit, the way I played today, I wouldn't be surprised if they red- tagged me already.Red tag in your locker means the manager wants to see you, 'cause you just died and went to the minors.Don't worry, they don't cut anybody the first day.What are you doin' there, Pedro?So are mine. Is somethin' goin' around?Maybe he's the pagan saint of baseball.Yeh, better get your snake ready, Hayes.If you're gonna use that head first slide, you better get yourself some gloves or you're not gonna have any skin left on your hands.Whatever happens, keep it to yourself until you're outta the locker room. Don't celebrate in front of guys who just died.Forget about Dorn. You got other things to do.Packing for Cleveland.Two down. Bottom of the ninth.What are you gonna have?French.Forget it. I'll order. Let's have a toast.Here's to baseball, here's to the start of two great careers, and for me, here's to at least one more good year in the sun.That's my wife.I mean she woulda been if I hadn't screwed it up. Who's that guy she's with?No.She's a librarian.Just a hunch. I took you there when you got your masters. I figure you're probably wearing the black velvet dress with the red sash.You look great.I'm playin' with the Indians again. Back in the Bigs.Wait a minute. What's your number. I tried calling you at home, but you're not listed...Meaning what? That I don't know you anymore?Okay, just gimme your number.Why not? Because of the guy you're with? What is he, a banker?I'm not leavin' without your number. You still wear those great little tortoise-shell glasses? I always loved it when you took them off.The number, Lynn...Thank you. I'm back, Lynn, and I'm gonna be around.Furnished apartment building owned by the Indians. We get special rates. With what we're makin' we'll need it.Welcome to the Big Leagues.You got anybody workin' there named Lynn Wells?Didn't think so.Take it easy. We got 162 of these to go.Easy does it, Ricky. We're only four down. We're still in this thing.I figure you got a 30% chance to survive this at bat.Couldn't cut it in the Mexican League.Only thing you got to be sorry about was hittin' Coleman.If you wanted to send a message, it shoulda been to Haywood. He hit the damn homer. Coleman was just picking his nose in the on-deck circle.Forget the other stuff. It coulda happened to anybody. Besides, Haywood didn't hit it that good. That ball wouldn't have been out of a lotta parks.Yellowstone.I was wonderin' why you'd give an old friend a bum phone number.I don't wanna talk in your office.Why not?What are you talkin' about? We were both athletes, world class, hot for each other. What more can you have in common?So what is it? You're still sore I never read Moby Dick?Not like what's-his-name at the restaurant?What do ya see in this guy?That's 'cause no stewardess would have him. Wouldn't you rather be with somebody who's in demand?C'mon, Lynn, for Christ sake, I'm just tryin' to loosen things up a little. I'm gettin' frostbite here.What? That's crazy, Lynn. I got plans for us.I was gonna play another a year or two, then we go to Hawaii, and have a couple kids who grow up to be Olympic champions.I'm sorry, Lynn, but I wasn't exactly proud of my situation. C'mon, you didn't think about me at all since I been gone?Remember the three nights we spent on the beach in Vera Cruz? You have nights like that with Mr. Briefcase?What was I supposed to do? She bet me fifty bucks she had a better body than you. I had to defend your honor.She's right. Take it from me, she really does. I mean Miss Dairy Queen has quantity, I give her that, but the, ah, quality just isn't there.How many think Lynn oughta give me another shot?The ayes have it.I'm afraid I have or I wouldn't be here. C'mon, Lynn, I don't wanna do time for things that happened years ago.Lynn, wait...Maybe the other one's jammed up.What is this, Lou?Well, they certainly have spared every expense.I'm about ready to turn in. I've anesthetized my knees enough.You're a celebrity now, Vaughn.Not if you do it colorfully.Guess we're over with, eh, Dorn?It's one of the masterpieces of American literature, that's all.Long time ago.No, I got some more reading to do.I might if I knew where she lives.You mean sit in a car and wait for her to come out? That's kinda juvenile, don't you think?Look, Lynn, I'm sorry I followed you home but I wanna...Whose place is it?Nah, that's o.k., I got some things to do...I, ah, just had a couple books I wanted to discuss with Lynn. I thought this was her place.Yeh, I heard you guys were engaged. Congratulations.Beer'll be fine.The Indians.Yeh, we have uniforms and everything. It's really great.That depends on how good they are, I guess.I make the League minimum.Somethin'll come up.I don't know, I was thinkin' of goin' to Hawaii, and having a couple of kids who grow up to be Olympic champions.Swimming. Maybe the two hundred meter Individual Medley. I figure it oughta be big by then.I did, but I wasn't smart enough to hold on to her.Alternate on the '80 Olympic Team.Well, I gotta be goin'. Nice to have met you all.Thanks for the beer.I'll let you know if I land a good job. I know you're concerned about it.Suck my dick.Drop in the bucket, Vaughn.Sacrifice? You mean like something living?Forget the runners, Ricky, get this guy at the plate.Okay, let's get nasty here, Rick. You know he's lookin' for this pitch. Gotta come up with somethin' studly.This isn't the California Penal League, Vaughn. We're professionals here. We don't tank a play for personal reasons, so cut the crybaby shit. You've pitched a helluva game. You wanna finish it, don't ya?Can you give me a strike on this pitch?Just make sure it's over the plate. I want him to swing.Don't worry, I'll take care of it.By the way, I been meaning to ask you. Why'd you steal that car?Next time you might think about takin' in a movie or somethin'.Helluva situation we got goin' here, huh, Rexman? Two on, two out, you're down by a run in the ninth. You got a chance to be a hero on national television, so whatever you do, don't blow it. They'll be callin' you a gutless choke artist all over America.You're a free agent at the end of the year. Not much demand for gutless choke artists. What are you hittin' now? .230? .240?Hey, nice average. Uh oh, on second thought, that still means you got a seven outta ten chance of goin' in the dumper.Hey, I can understand not wantin' to talk about baseball when your nuts are in a vice like this.By the way, I saw your wife at the Capri Lounge last night. Hell of a dancer. You must be very proud.But that guy she was with... I mean I'm sure he's a close personal friend of yours and all, but tell me......Why was he wearing her panties on his head?Uh oh, Rexie, I don't think that one's got the distance. Maybe if the wind comes up.Fine, Suzanne, can I have a quick word with Rodger?I just wanta tell ya somethin', but I didn't want to do it in front of the whole team.I don't know what your problem is, but... ...if I ever see you tank another play like you did tonight, I'll cut off your nuts and stuff 'em down your fuckin' throat.I heard the Big Lady upstairs ordered it.Ah shit, here comes Lou. Gimme a break, Mel. I gotta get outta here.Right. Good idea.Fucker called that a ball.Yeh.You still got that great kick. Just like the first time I ever saw you.Yeh, what did you want to see me about?You wouldn't have been at the game if you didn't want to see me about something.How was I?I'll try that. You wanna have some dinner?Right. I forgot your life is different now.Anytime.Whose place are we at this time?Yeh. When I saw you at the game, I figured you wanted to see me about something.How was I?I'll try that.Goin' uptown, huh?You think I can't lead a regular life?That was a hoax. The girl was just trying to get some publicity.I was drownin', Lynn. The endorsements were dryin' up, my knees were goin', they were talkin' about sendin' me down. I was just trying to hold on to somethin', prove to myself I was still an All-Star. I don't care about that anymore. I know I don't have much time left in baseball. I'm just a guy trying to put his life back together. Thinkin' about you was the only thing that kept me goin' in Mexico.I guess this is our last hurrah then.Cover to cover.When's the wedding?Your mom and dad like this guy?Gonna be a big wedding?Where?I mean the wedding.Nice church.Nobody. It was Queequeg's coffin. Am I invited?To the wedding.Lynn?The zipper on your skirt is stuck.Sure, go ahead. I think my reading days are over.These are all Hall of Famers.C'mon, Rick baby, settle down.What's the problem, Rick? You're throwin' basketballs up there. That guy in the dugout botherin' you?Forget him. Worry about the guys carryin' bats. C'mon, Ricky, let's get nasty.I don't know about the rest of you, but I've been playin' baseball since I was five years old. I've had some good years and some years to forget. I've burned out my knees... I don't think I have three fingers that work right... I've lost most of the money I made and baseball has messed up my personal life from time to time. But I know one thing... I can still play this game a little. And I'd like to know who in this room thinks they're the kinda bum Mrs. Phelps is lookin' for?Well, then, I guess there's only one thing to do.Win the whole fuckin' thing.We're a Major League baseball team, but since we haven't won a pennant in thirty years, nobody recognizes us, not even in our own hometown.Look what it's done for us. People still don't recognize us, but... ...we're in the first division now.We haven't won anything yet. We still got one more to go.Darla.I don't know...No, I had to sell it.Not after your knees go bad.Darla, I don't think I can do this.I guess I'm just not that guy anymore.Lynn, wait...Hello, Suzanne.Vaughn?You look beautiful.I can't stay. We gotta get to the park.Yeh, you too. Tell me one thing. The night you came up to my hotel -- was there really a library conference?Too bad it didn't work out better. I just wanna say I'm sorry for all the things I've put you through over the years.Can't be sorry for that. Nothing happened.I didn't have to. She knew she was outclassed.I don't know what Dorn's wife is up to, but I think it'd be best if you dressed early and got out to the bullpen before Dorn comes in.Tell him not to worry, I'll take care of it.Nope. Haven't seen him.It's comin' in now.One whole chicken, like you said.Believe me, Jo-Buu will like this. He's gotta be gettin' tired of raw chicken.You want Vaughn?C'mon Ricky, this guy is the out you been waitin' your whole life for.Oh, shit.All right, Ricky, let's get nasty.All right, looks like the boy is pumped. Sucker was movin', wasn't it? Ever hit ya, it'd leave a two foot hole comin' out.Let's see, what should we call now. Let's see how he feels about old number one.Nice swing, Haywood. Good follow- through. Keep it up, I'll show you the ball sometime.Well, shit, all these pitches to choose from. Maybe we'll try somethin' different this time.And if I don't see you again, Haywood, have a nice winter.

I got a guy on the other line about some whitewalls. I'll talk to ya later.I used to coach the unwed mothers' softball team. I have advanced some.Naw, I'm just not sure I'd be happy in a big organization like that. Owners are always on your back, tryin' to \"help you out.\"Down here baseball's a game, not a business. I don't wanta be a babysitter for a buncha millionaires who think they know it all already.Well then, bonus babies or whatever you got...Don't you have any proven major league talent?Well, then... I'll be up in a couple days.Sounds like my kinda team. Have my contracts ready.He was an Allstar in Boston, wasn't he?Who's that?What's his religion?Thought you didn't have any high- priced talent.Still hits the ball pretty well, doesn't he?We'll shape him up.Lou Brown. Nice to meet ya, Hayes.Welcome to Spring Training, gentlemen. Most managers tell you at this time that all the jobs are open, that nobody's a lock at any position, and that talent isn't everything. They'd rather see desire and discipline in a player. Then they tell you that most of all they want you to have fun out there, even though they're gonna work your ass off on fundamentals and condition you till you drop. The difference between me and those other managers is... I mean it.Get him a uniform.How the knees holdin' up, Jake?Mobility's good? No problem gettin' off the throw to second?I need a catcher, Jake. Somebody who can keep this team together on the field. You were a helluva player when you were sound, but around the league they think you can't take the pounding anymore.I'm gonna have to put you to the test, ya know. So, I want the absolute truth here. Are you 100 percent?You better if you wanna make this team.C'mon, Hayes, this isn't the All Star Game. Get up to the damn plate.Well, you may run like Mays, but you hit like shit.I think Mr. Hayes shows some promise. His speed could be a big asset.You gotta stop swingin' for the fences though, Hayes. All you're gonna do is give yourself a hernia. With your speed you should be hittin' the ball on the ground, leggin' 'em out. Every time I see you hit one in the air, you owe me twenty pushups.Sometimes you can teach a guy to hit. You can't teach him to run.All right, Vaughn, they tell us you're a pitcher. Let's see what you got.Nice velocity.How much?Better teach him some control before he kills somebody.C'mon, Dorn, get in front of the damn ball. Don't give me this ole' bullshit.I'm deeply moved. Every time you play it off your hip, you give me forty sit-ups.So is this.Jesus, this guy hits a ton. How come nobody else picked up on him?Oh.Sure.Good, I like that kinda spirit in a player. The only problem is, I didn't cut you.I think somebody's been havin' fun with you.Can I have your attention, please? I counted up your ballots for team captain and I think you chose the right guy. If you hadn't, I woulda told you he won anyway. Mr. C for the year -- Jake Taylor.All right, let's gather 'round.I'm not much for inspirational addresses. I just wanta point out that every newspaper in the country has picked us to finish last. The local press thinks we'd save everybody a lot of time and trouble if we just went out and shot ourselves. Me, I like to waste sportswriters' time so I'm for hangin' around and seein' if we can give all these guys a nice big shitburger to eat.You guys go ahead. I belong to the church of three-run homers.All right, way to look, way to look. Nice catch, Hayes. Don't ever fuckin' do it again. Okay, let's get it goin'!No, let's see how he reacts.Interesting.I think you can go get him now.Front office says it's an economy measure, 'cause we're not drawin' good.C'mon in, Rick.Rick, I'm not gonna beat around the bush here. You got a great arm, one of the best I've ever seen, but your control hasn't come around like we hoped it would.Now, there are a lotta pitchers that started out wild and, after workin' it out in the minors, for a while, went on to great careers. Take Sandy Koufax there...Never mind Koufax.Read these letters, starting at the top.Can't read it, can you?Nope.All right, let's hit the field.No, he's come this far. Let's see if he can finish it.It's startin' to come together, Pepper. It's startin' to come together.Oh man, this old body can use a soak.Damn it, I thought they were gonna replace this thing.She's at it again. I've had it with this nickel and dime stuff. I'm gonna get the Bitch on the phone.Yeh.There aren't any towels, and I'm too old to be diving under benches.What happened to the new whirlpool we were supposed to get?You fixed it six times already. And now there's no hot water in the showers.How am I supposed to keep my players healthy with cold water and no therapy equipment?Over 162 games even tough guys get sprains, sore arms, muscle pulls...Hey, don't you go anywhere. I wanna have a few words with you.What are we arguin' about here?You mean the one that was a foot outside?Good thing we don't play anybody in Europe.I don't know if we can survive any more of these economy measures.I thought now that Vaughn had some control, he was ready for the Yankees.Donovan. Hell no. What are you doin' here?Someday we'll figure out how to beat those guys.Sixty and sixty-one is hardly a helluva job.Ya know, when I first got to camp I figured this team had no chance. I was just hopin' we'd win enough that I could stay on and really start to build something here. But there's a lotta talent on this club, Charlie. The veterans are starting to play back to form and the rookies are developing faster than I thought. There's two or three potential all- stars in there. I think we're a first division team right now.I know it. All we need is something to bring it all together.What do you mean?I got somethin' I think you oughta know about. I wouldn't have known about it myself if Charlie Donovan hadn't told me, although I shoulda guessed it from everything that's happened. It seems that Mrs. Phelps doesn't think too highly of our worth.She put this team together because she thought we'd be bad enough to finish dead last, knockin' attendance down to the point where she could move the team to Miami. And get rid of all of us for better personnel.Even you, Dorn.That's about it.She'll replace you with somebody who will. After this season, you'll all be sent back to the minors or given your outright release. So, all we're gonna get is this one year.I figure it's gonna take 32 more victories to win this thing. Every time we win, we peel a square.Yeh, Rick. I just wanted to tell you that I'm startin' Harris tomorrow against the Yankees, even though it's your turn in the rotation.He's got more experience and a little better record against the Yankees.Don't read anything into it, Rick. You're one of the guys that got us here.I wanted to hand in my resignation before you had a chance to fire me.I know what you been tryin' to do with this team. After the season, I want no part of it.Why would you want him to tell somebody?You tryin' to make me believe you wanted us to win all along?Bullshit. What about the plane, the bus, the bad hotels...Why should I believe any of this? Now that we're winnin' it's easy for you to jump on the bandwagon.All right, guys, let's take it to 'em.Damn, havin' trouble with the curve ball again.You pitched a hell of a game, Steve. Take a seat and we'll see if we can get this guy for ya.Give me Vaughn.I know he hasn't done real well against this guy, but I got a hunch he's due.Okay, Ricky, Haywood likes the hard stuff in. Curve him on the hands, bust him away, and don't get up with anything. You listenin' to me Rick?O.K., kid, you're my man. Let's go get him.Forget the curveball. Go with the heater.Ya know I'd be an ass not to pinch- hit for you here. You're 0 for 18 against Duke. Plus you're beat to shit you can hardly walk, there's no way you can get around on this guy's fast ball. So I want the absolute truth here. Can you beat this guy?Okay.Send Hayes the first pitch. I don't want Taylor takin' too many strikes.Flashing some signals.

With a house and a garden and normal hours.You like the life you've had, Jake. You like hangin' out with the boys, livin' in hotels, eatin' dinner at midnight, having girls send you their underwear in the mail. Remember the surprise party I threw for you when you made the All-Star team? You never showed up, but the doorbell rang once and we all got quiet and hid behind the furniture. It was a guy to serve you with a paternity suit.Yes, but you had obviously been with her. And it happened in front of all our friends.I've come back to you too many times, Jake. I can't afford to believe you anymore.I guess so. Did you really read \"Moby Dick?\"October third.You're still their favorite.Tom doesn't like big weddings. You coulda read Plot Outlines of 101 Great Novels.At any library.All Saints on Euclid.Yeh. Who saved Ishmael at the end?Where?If you want. Maybe you really did read it.This doesn't change anything, you know. We were always good at this.What?Use your imagination.Excuse me. I was in town for a conference and thought I'd drop by, but I can see you're busy...Thank you. I didn't think you'd come.Good luck today, Jake.No, I came to see you.Even for last night?Then you weren't defending my honor again?", "clean_line": "hello jake know know dress thanks doin aren supposed mexico great happy jake gotta life different knew couldn talk time gotta think good idea lawyer jake watching jake right jake shouldn come let talk office okay told think good idea common wonder stopped bein athlete years ago books life dare laugh jake years ve best special collections departments country read asked tom voice stable intelligent ve bed stewardess like seriously joke tom getting married fall plans think stuff like haven seen years wrote letter loud jake night detroit miss dairy queen bunch bullshit better body haven changed sorry jake ll little boy wouldn grow isn place yeh gotta goin best baseball problems knees yes individual medley follow mean wanted play looked good oughta open stance little pitching inside sorry ate thanks race follow wanted play looked good oughta open stance little pitchin inside think oughta tell moving tom goin uptown want lead regular life know like adult maybe house garden normal hours like life ve jake like hangin boys livin hotels eatin dinner midnight having girls send underwear mail remember surprise party threw star team showed doorbell rang got quiet hid furniture guy serve paternity suit yes obviously happened friends ve come times jake afford believe anymore guess read moby dick october favorite tom like big weddings coulda read plot outlines great novels library saints euclid yeh saved ishmael end want maybe read change know good use imagination excuse town conference thought drop busy thank think come good luck today jake came night weren defending honor"}}}
