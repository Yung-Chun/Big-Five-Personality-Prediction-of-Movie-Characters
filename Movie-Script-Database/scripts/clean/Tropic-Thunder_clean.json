Gotta dig deeper to mine the true emotional,paydirt. Diagram the source of the pain. Then live it.Yeah... but Simple Jack thought he was smart. Or, rather, didn't think he was retarded. So you can afford to play retarded', being a smart actor. Tricky tricky stuff. Hats off for going. there. Especially.knowing how the Academy is about that shit. Speedman is lost:Are you serious? Everyone knows you don't ever go fully retarded!Check it out. Dustin Hoffman, Rain Man. Looked retarded. Acted retarded. NOT retarded. He could count toothpicks, cheat at cards. Autistic. Sure. NOT retarded. HANKS'. Forest Gump. Slow? Yes.You went full retard, man. You never go 14 full retard. Don't believe me? Ask Sean Penn, 2001, I am Sam. Went full retard. Went home empty handed. Speedman sees this for the truth it is. How could he be so stupid?But hey, man! Who knows? Four Leaf could be your ticket to Oscar gold. I'd lose the hook hands though... cripples don't give the Academy wood either.Are you nuts, shithead? The dude is dead!! Sandusky looks unsure. He doesn't want to take sides.What the FUCK is wrong with you people?! Speedman shoots him a look then takes a few steps back. He addresses the treeline.Yo, asshole! Mothafucka just DIED! Speedman sighs, annoyed.Jaysus! There isn't going to be any movie, ya gobshite!Psst. Hey. Sandusky turns to see Lazarus peeing uncomfortably close to him.Speedman is watching. I don't have much time. I don't really need to piss. I need to talk to you. You went to the boot camp Sandusky, right? You can read that map?Good, good. Speedman is a tosser. That hoor's melt really thinks this is a movie. And he's got the lot of ya convinced.Of course not! It's only a matter of time before he walks us into more mines or more of whoever the hell was shootin', at us. That muppet's going to get us all killed. I need to convince everyone.to turn around, but I .can't do it without the map. You're the only one who can read it. Can I count on you?Good man, Good man. Lazarus makesa big show of pretending he's done peeing, shaking, etc.., and heads back to the group. Speedman eyes Lazarus. What is he up to? Sandusky is just getting comfortable, begins to pee again. He hears another rustle. He turns.to see Speedman, right next to him.Look, ya eejit, I mean, if there was a village don't you think we would have hit it by now?. Hey, Is there a feckin' river on that map? S.pee`dman refers to the'now sopping wet map.I don't see a \"Sampan\" boat!Sandusky agrees. with me. Don't you, Sandusky? Kevin is caught, not sure what to dNo, yer an actor. Arid if memory serves, a pretty shite one. The actors react -- Damn! Oh Snap! Shit! Speedman steels' himself.Jay-sus Fuck! It's Viet Cona! Not Viet Congs! Viet Cong, you plunker! And, hey, if you're so sure of yourself, why don't you let Kelvin have a look at the map?! Kevin doesn't know what to do -- he doesn't want to get in the middle of this. Speedman continues to be the tough guy.No one is \"pussing out.\" They just prefer not. to die.out here. Sandusky, can you get'us back to the landing zone without the map?Okay, which is it, gentlemen? Playin' war with Mister Box Office? Or staying alive?Make a note gentlemen,. unwittingly, Jeffrey Portnoy is joining the proud ranks of those of us who have suffered for art. A new frontier for you, Funny Man. When this is all over, you might have more than flatulence to offer an audience. Portnoy looks a little hurt.You know, Redykulous', I respect what it is you do, the rapping, the rhyme-talking -- invented by the Irish I might add.Oh...I see...Put another way -- you're mad because I can act \"black\" better than you can.Niggaz always got to be niggaz. This is truly over the line. Redykulous lunges at Lazarus. They fight. Redykulous throws a wide punch, that Lazarus deftly avoids, that hooks Portnoy right in the jaw. Sandusky jumps in and pries them apart.Sandusky is right... we could all learn a little from his common sense approach. From now on we walk Indian style, footstep upon footstep. Sandusky. . .you take first position. He breaks off a branch, and hands it to Sandusky, and pushes him out front. Sandusky gives him a look.Your bravery shames us. Sandusky reluctantly starts down the path, tapping for land mines with the branch. The guys follow at a VERY safe distance. EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT AM l u I, I nhy CLOSE. ON Speedman's face. After a beat.a drop of water hits him in the.forehead. Then another. PULL BACK to reveal a pathetic shelter made. out of headphone. wire, and the In Style magazine.' The drip-is now becoming full on RAIN. He clutches an Equal packet and. the Cherry Chapstick. Gently, he puts the chapstick-to his face and takes a tentative bite, as though he were eating human flesh. He then tears open the Equal packet and empties its contents into his hand,.and takes. a lick, savoring every granule. He hears a rustling in the bushes across from him. A rodent? Food? Excited, he pulls out his Bowie knife and begins to stalk his prey. Now another movement behind.the bush, and a flash of. fur... Stealthily, he moves towards it. With cat like quickness, and knife drawn, he lunges onto the bush, A HUGE ROAR is heard...What's wrong with him?Alright. Sandusky? Sandusky looks up at him. Is he serious?You and Redykulous are gonna have to carry Portnoy. God help you. He marches off.\"EXT. P.O.W. PRISON CAMP -- DAY\"! Oranges and Lemons,,, the bells of St. Clements. Speedman was right. We 'are shooting the movie. Sandusky grabs the binoculars and starts'looking..., How could I be so stupid.How do you know all,this?What do you see?Sweet Mother of Jaysus. Suddenly: GUNFIRE ERUPTS ALL AROUND! A BAND OF GUERILLAS have spotted them and are running at them, firing automatic weapons... The guys scream, and start a frantic retreat down the hill. Portnoy suddenly gets well enough to run out of his stretcher for dear life... In fact, he is actually beating them down the hill.. .when suddenly WHUMP! He falls into a PIT!That's right. So here's the plan. Everyone leans forward expectantly.We sneak out of here, make our way back to the hotel and once we're safe, we alert the government of Speedman's situation.We could fooster about for donkey's years..Let:'s quit acting the maggot and nix that mentaller. The guys look at each other. What did that mean?Jaysus! We're too late. They brained him! REDYKULOUS grabs the binoculars. Sees for himself.That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard.Listen.. .Don't be crazy Portnoy --you're not a fuck up. You'make millions of people laugh!I'll try. Lazarus takes Speedman's face in his hands, forces him to look at him..You're Chris Michael Speedman!You're the greatest star in the world! There's a flicker of intelligence in Speedman's eyes. It passes.The world needs you! It` needs its stars! You make people forget how awful and 1\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I Ii I. 1 ,14M depressing their lives are! People love your work! And... I love your work, too. Speedman is quiet.Simple Jack was magnificent!JESUS! Give me time, Sandusky! I'm not re- programming a VCR!! You really committed yourself. And for that you DESERVED AN OSCAR! Speedman registers this.You know who you are... . you do Chris. Long beat.Unlike me. What am I doing? I can't do this. How can I convince a man he is who we know he is, when I can't even convince myself of the same thing. He lets go of Speedman, and begins to break down.Am I Redykulous? ... AM I!...Or.am I just acting like that's who I am? No. The sad fact is... I'm not Sergeant Osiris. . .or Father O'Malley ...or' Neil .Armstrong. I'm not even .Kirk Lazarus. I have no idea who I am.

WE NOW PULL BACK TO REVEAL we are actually on location shooting this war scene with about 50 CREW MEMBERS watching, surrounded by millions of dollars worth of film equipment. Four Leaf, actually the superstar. playing him, Speedman, is getting increasingly self-conscious, becoming more and. more aware of the-crew waiting for him to cry. The actor playing Osiris, KIRK LAZARUS, is also getting uncomfortable holding Speedman's not-crying head.You don't know which way is up, do you private`? You couldn't find a dixie coonskin with an Ohio hooker holding your prick. and showin' you the way... Damien doesn't know what the fuck that meant. Four Leaf moves to him, staring deep into his eyes. Damien's eyes widen in fear.A raindrop cannot carve a valley. An ant cannot defeat a buffalo. But a tempest can cleave that mountain to make the valley, and an army of ants can fell the mighty buffalo.If the lion, although king of the jungle, is thrown into the sea, he will drown... but...if...I put my story in your limp Brit hands and you will not fail me!! My boys were worse pussies than these guys. But the shit is what made us a unit. A whole. You must put them in theThere's a place. About a hundred clicks from here, as the crow flies. Deep in the jungle. No trailers, no port-a-potties. Nothing but triple canopy jungle and cockroaches the size of melons. Damien seems intrigued yet a little freaked out by his weirdness.Rig up your documentary cameras'in that jungle, give me and Cody a few of those smoke bombs and some charges and we could light up the jungle so those lily-dick actors would think they were in the middle of. Hamburger Hill. You.get them thinking they're getting shot at, and you'll have your movie. Suddenly, Four Leaf slaps his neck with his hook as though he has been bitten. He holds out a small squished mosquito' between the claws of his prosthesis.You must put them.under your thumb the way this. bug is under mine... .under YOUR control.Yes... yes...Save your breath, maggots! They all shrink back. Four Leaf's fierce posture is undercut as the helicopter lurches, sending Damien sprawling onto hire.See you in hell! As the noise of the helicopter fades, the group starts. trying to orient itself in their new surroundings.' The Jungle. Black, dense, unforgiving. All around them can be seen the remnants of a war that has been over for thirty years. A grave marker,. half of an old rusted out\u00e2\u0080\u00a2'downed chopper. All are absorbing the spookiness, except Portnoy who seems very upset.I don't know what it's called. I just know the sound it makes when it takes a man's life. Cody, a little spooked, picks up his radio.Hear that? Cody is preoccupied with the radio and the explosives.Oh yeah. And with that Cody and Four Leaf are.RIFLE BUTTED out of consciousness...In a detention hut. And they got Speedman...Pull it together private! Shut your trap before you get us killed! You understand me , lilydick? ! Cody backs off, still scared.That poor bastard. Looks like they coo- coo nested him.What plan?Sometimes the flowing stream can only move when... the water... dries up.It means I'm,sick of your yappin'!I gotta what? Take on the whole compound by myself!No! Four Leaf and his men were real, it happened!YES! Well ...no! I mean, kinds! Yeah! Not exactly. I served honorably in what they called the \"forced service\". Sanitation Detail at the United States Pentagon.God-dammit, would you LISTEN! I was a fuckup, sure, but one day as I was cleaning the office of some Top-Brass big- wig, I came across a file headed for the shredder marked top secret. It was Four Leaf Tayback's file. A nobody. No family. Nothing. Killed in Action. They were gonna bury the whole thing. Total black op.NO! I gave him one! I wrote the story And I gave the American people a hero! Yes, I am not technically Four Leaf, but if I didn't pretend to be him then nobody woulda ever known who he was! See what I'm sayin'?I was a fuck up my whole life! This guy had a story worth-telling, and nobody woulda ever known! Cody slumps in the corner, looking spent and lost.I'm sorry, man.. I'm responsible: for this .whole mess.Something's happening! Get me the hooks!Marvin Kaminsky.Nope. First time outta the states actually. He shoots off a round and they run for cover.You go... I got real bullets! I'll cover you.. It's the only way you'll make it!Just go!! Sandusky looks at Speedman... they both know he's right. They go... leaving Four Leaf in the dust, still firing... The jeep speeds up to the helipad... the guys jump out. Just as the last guy is out...Go on...get outta here. I'm worm food, you dig?I ain't Four Leaf, Chris.

Damien grips his headphones in confusion, looking around to his cadre of assistants and ADs... The chopper continues to hover, soldiers continue to fight, except a few are starting to wonder what's going on.CUT! We gotta cut, Dorf!No! Not still rolling! Cut! Damien runs towards Speedman. Fats, who is young fat comedy gross-out star JEFF PORTNOY, gets up from the ground, rubbing his butt.I'm sorry.. I can't do it, Dorff. Damien runs up to Speedman. They are the center of attention -- the whole crew watching them.(above the din of theWait, hey, y'know, maybe- is it the line? \"You are my brothers\"? I don't think I would.say that. Four Leaf wouldn't say that.Is he here, or is he-'at the.hotel? Because I would love to run it by him.I think I got another in me if you want to go again, Damien. Damien looks at the scorched treeline behind them. Speedman looks too, then looks back at Damien.Your call. In the background, Cody is casually putting out a fire on his lap. He gives an 'I'm O.K.' gesture to no one in particular.You mu-mu-muhhh make me'ha-aaaapy.All I want is to make the real Four Leaf here proud. It's his story, he lived it and wrote it in his book. That's why we're here. But really, I mean, how cah we begin to understand what he-- what you --went through? Four Leaf fixes his stoic, steely gaze on the horizon for a beat. He lifts his hands up, and we see he has only two HOOKS. Speedman studies him closely, aping his gestures, trying to \"get inside\" him as much as possible.That's great. He's like a... Buddha or something. Maybe I should rub his belly for luck! He laughs, but quickly realizes Four Leaf doesn't find it funny.Hey, Dorf. Just wanted to call and throw a little pep talk your way. I know today was rough, and you're probably mad at yourself for not getting the shots, but that's the way these movies go. We all boot it from time to time, and today was just one of those days. Happens.Oh, also needed to let you know, and I. .know you're like wrapped up with the movie, but I really need that new chef like we talked about, you know to really 4 get that super-ripped thing happening. This guy is great but all he makes are dumplings. And they stiill haven't worked out the TiVo thing. III I. I I 4IYeah, of course, I just know we talked about getting super-super-ripped for that starvation sequence Speedman's other line goes. He sees the caller I.D.Oh,, shit-- can you hang on a sec, D? He switches over,, but it takes a few seconds with the hooks.Rick?.What?Yeah. Thanks.No I'm fine. I've just been having a tough time over here. They still havn't got the TiVo hooked up and... I don't know... Lazarus is getting all this Oscar buzz already --Yeah but the way they talk about him. I mean, he played a retarded guy and won an Oscar, I play a retarded guy and don't even get a nomination. I don't know, I mean you said \"Simple Jack\" would be my \"Elf\" but with Oscars. Those were your exact words.Yes but --Yeah. You are right.I guess I just watched some retarded people. I mean, I spent a lot. of time. with them... watching them.. Watching all the retarded stuff they did.Exactly! With Jack. I was, for the first time in-my life.. Retarded. I was retarded.in.the trailer, retarded at home., Brushing my. teeth retarded. In a `weird way I had to unlearn what it was to be... .NOT retarded.About what?How do you mean? Lazarus sets his. drink down. School's in session.\"When... we.'.. put... aside... our... differences... we see we're kind of the same.\" Within moments, the place settles completely.\"When we put aside our differences, we see we're kind of the same. Let's be friends, I know we will do great things together.\"I was looking-at it all backwards. You guys are lost. You heed.me to.lead you, to help you gel, and straighten.up -- like a PLATOON! A long beat.Whoa.C'mon! Don't you get it? This is what .Dorf was talking about -- our slice of the Nam! He's trying to get in our heads!That whole \"life and death\" speech in the chopper? He's meshing 'with us! What do you think all that \"playing God\" was about? The guys breathe a huge collective sigh of relief -- except Lazarus.Kirk. I know you're the big fancy actor here, but, no offense, I've done a lot mote effects driven event films, and I think I can spot a prop body.I got a baaaad feeling on this one, Fats. The group remains motionless., Speedman gives Portnoy a ,M in MAIM \"c'mon!\" type look. Portnoy doesn't know what he means...I said, I got a baaad feeling on this one, Brooklyn... Oh! He's acting! Sandusky hesitantly takes the cue, and starts walking. stealthily around.with him, on high.alert.for Charlie. Swinging his gun unpredictably.Naw, man. I know you ain't crazy Brooklyn....Naw, man... I wouldn't think you was a queer.That's enough outta you Fats. Don't you worry, Brooklyn. You gotta lotta days a fucking ahead of you and I for one ain't gonna let Charlie... Lazarus can't handle it anymore.Sorry Damien! Back to one... action! Don't you worry, Brooklyn, You gottaHow many more takes you wanna wreck? Some of us are taking this seriously. Lazarus looks likes he wants to explode. But instead he becomes eerily calm. He begins an impressive transformation -- Everything except for his skin color returns to his real identity, a pompous Irish prick.Excuse me Kirk, I think you dropped something. He mimes picking something , off, the ground.It's called your character. Don't worry, I won't tell the Academy! Suddenly: GUNFIRE FROM EVERYWHERE! The Guerrillas have seized the moment. The actors all immediately hit the dirt, except for Speedman,.who just looks annoyed and blase as dirt and debris kicks up all around him.You happy now? We're out of position for the effect! Am I the only one who read .the script?! This is the ambush! A tree aboveSpeedman gets hit, explodes, sprays chunks of wood and shrapnel everywhere.What are you guys worried about? These guys are pros. The unions would tear them a new ass-if any of us got hurt. The actors stay down, looking scared.Come on, you guys! Let's use this!Damien said to head north. I'm guessing they've got more of these \"battles\" and Viet Congs rigged for uls on the way. Alright, let's hump-our shit to D'ang Kwook! Let's didi double time! We got a lot of clicks to cover! Speedman heads off into a particularly dense section of jungle. After a beat, he reappears, looking a little lost.Oh yeah. Thanks, uh...Right. Okay, To D'ang Kwook! Lets do-it- to-it! Everyone follows Speedman. Lazarus, very reluctantly, brings up the rear, still looking off into the jungle. AWe'll see some action soon enough. And try to stay in character. We're on camera..Whenever Damien decides it's time, I guess.I don't know. That's the whole point. Damien wants us tired and confused.Fine, fine. Okay, let's take a break, but be on the lookout for anything. Charlie doesn't care if you're on a break or not. Speedman plunks down and opens the map. He seems puzzled. Lazarus eyes him suspiciously. Sandusky walks off to take a leak. Lazarus then watches him go. Off to the side, Sandusky starts to pee. He hears something rustle next to him.I'm gonna level with you, bro. I don't need to pee. I need to talk to you. Speedman surreptitiously takes out a can of Pymp Sweat and sticks the tip of his Bowie knife into it, to create a red pee.stream.Lazarus is insane. He's freaking out, and. he's gonna.ruin the whole movie for all of us. The men respect you, because you went to boot camp and rehearsal. And you're pretty handy with that map. I need you on my side, Kyle.Good man. Good man. Speedman rejoins the group, gives Lazarus a cocky look.If we stay on this trajectory we should be reaching the village any minute now. At the end of the line, we hear a few groans emanating from Portnoy.Buck up,, Fats ...we got a long road ahead of us...Quit your carping, we're right where we're supposed to be!Yes! There is! Its just a little more' down to the... lefty-down part from the: village. Anyway,. this feels like the Sampan, Boat Raid at the end of the second act.Any second now one should come by. Alright men, into the water! Everyone'except Lazarus reluctantly gets into the water. They all hold their rifles above their heads.Wait! First of all... Now Speedman grabs him.Kelvin believes in this movie. And, second, need I remind you,. I am your superior officer.THAT'S THE WAY OUT! That's our only chance!Help from where! Need I remind you that Damien's orders were to -- --stay in character. Now, I already have an international box office presence, but for some of you, I'm guessing you might not want to screw this movie up! This actually seems to affect the actors. Lazarus can't believe it..okay...C'mon, boys! This way. Let's go get those Viet Congs! Lazarus throws down his gun. He's had it.Be my guest. Speedman hands over the soggy map. Kevin looks. After a long beat...I can't believe you people!. You're pussing out on me? We are supposed to be a unit!Unbelievable!. Are you guys really gonna abandon this movie? A long tense. beat -- finally, Sandusky walks towards Lazarus. Everyone follows him. Speedman looks stunned. After a moment, he shakes his head and begins crossing the river, holding his rifle with both hands over his head.So that's the way it,,is, huh? Fine! I'll finish the movie alone! (turns to Lazarus, under hisYeah, I do! I'm going to \"EX'S. JUNGLE. DUSK. FOUR LEAF PINNED DOWN AND ALONE\". And, I can shoot it alone. They'watch him trudge into the foliage. U2'S \"BULLET THE BLUE SKY\" comes up as the men watch Speedman disappear...DORF!...CODY?!...What's the deal with a meal break? Are they gonna chopper stuff in later on? I don't wanna be a prima donna or anything, but, we gotta eat, right?Die! Die, you son of a bitch! Die! Speedman deals a death blow. And unleashes a primal VICTORY SCREAM. Spent, he finally gets a good look at his victim: A.small, cute, cuddly PANDA... Speedman looks horrified...No! A Panda! I killed a panda!I don't think so. I'm out in.the bush. Alone.Alright. P.O.W camp. Scene 67..Bring it on Dorf.You bastard.Corporal Four Leaf Tayback. And oh. yeah. . .THIS is from my uncle... SAM! He HEAD BUTTS Byong in the face,. sending him reeling into the back wall.

Away from them...What?Well this is about work ...my show so to. .speak. Do you understand?Excuse me, everyone! If I could have your attention! Nothing. No one notices except Speedman.

We will also be rigging this entire valley of death with hidden cameras so that every glorious moment gets on film. And believe me it WILL be glorious. If it looks real, chances are good it probably is. You wanted to be actors? You wanted to occupy the skin of another human being?

The guys hit the dirt. Lazarus crawls up to join them. He pulls out his binoculars, and surveys the scene.I don't think so... . looks to me like some sort of heroin processing plant. Look at the cooking vats, and the guards. Sandusky continues looking through the binoculars.It was a long trip. I read the in-flight magazine. We're in the Golden Triangle, the biggest drug producer in the world. Uh-oh.It doesn't look good. Lazarus grabs the binoculars.Must be one of those underground tunnels. The-cou-ntr-y-is-l-itte-red-with them. Je-f-f must have found one of the entrances,:. Portnoy is on his side in pain, whimpering.Lemme see... Sandusky rolls him.over, and off camera, helps him remove his pants... All the guys recoil in horror.How did it get infected so fast? More ad libs of disgust...OH! my bad. You just got grazed. You're gonna be fine.It looks clear, but I can't be sure. I say we stay in here till it's dark.Forget it. That guard patrol knows we're out'here. They'll be looking for us. Anyway, Speedman's in that compound. And no one else knows but us.Whoa whoa whoa ... . wait! So, we're just gonna leave him here?We've gotten this far. Look, we're making a movie about one of the greatest rescues ever. It's a true story,, right? I mean, those guys weren't superheroes! They were just put in extra-ordinary circumstances, and they rose to the occasion.And we don't? They believed they could do it. They believed in each other. Look, I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.Jeff -- I know this is really hard for you,.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2but you're gonna have to kick some time, and it might as well be now. Kirk, I've always admired you as an actor. But as a person, I have to say, not that impressive.' You got a.few Oscars. Got any balls? Lazarus takes this in.Redyk. Whadda.you say? You talk a good game, but how's it gonna feel when you're sipping Cristalle with your homies.in the hot tub back in.Cali knowing you left.a man to die back here? You gonna rhyme about that? , There is a long beat.We gotta get him outta there...What is it?Yeah. Sorry Portnoy. That's lame. I say we wait till just before dawn and sneak over the fence. Take our chances. You guys ok with that? The group nods in approval.Good. Then let's get some rest. Me and Redyk are on first watch. I'll wake you in two hours, and we'll switch. They break up. Portnoy comes up to Sandusky, extremely freaked out.Yes you are.Okay.. .Lazarus, you heard him. Tie him up. We'll get you through it.Wow... .look at all those stars. Makes a guy feel pretty small.Back in LA, we don't get stars like this. I wonder why there are so many here?I don't know. I give us pretty good odds. Redykulous looks at'his watch, and lets out a chuckle.What's so funny?Who?You did that?Yeah. . .well at least you have someone to think about.Yeah,... .I guess. I dunno. I got a girl. But it's not too serious.I don't think we're in love.What?.No you don't. What would the great Redykulous, know about Girl Problems. You're ten girls deep 24 hours a day!How do you mean?What? But...All this from the same guy who wrote\"Niggaz Gotta Bust a Nut on a Ho\".So what! You're gay! You're also a great artist and-businessman ... why not rap about that? \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdu I\u00c2\u00b0 I. 11\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdjmI'm not gonna tell anyone, and your not gonna shoot me... .th-at's it...l-et -tout. Redykulous pulls back, and collects himself.Listen, I know how utterly Redykulous you are. Even for just.thisone moment. . .and sometimes that enough.This is it. You know what you need to do.' Tropic Thunder on three, two, one...Oh sweet Jesus. Hold tight, Buddy! I'll be right back! Sandusky runs off to get the guys.Shhh! A muffled, anguished animal noise that could only be PORTNOY emanates from a nearby door. They run towards it. Redykulous kicks it in.Come on, let's go! We found Speedmani.he's gay. Uh-oh. That's not what Redykulous was about to say. Beat.Sorry...Damnit! We need to go!I think he thinks he's Simple Jack. Like from the movie?Can you fix him?!Is it working?Guys, let's go, we gotta get outta here! I it I. 11h.4%Kirk, this is NOT the time!My name...you remembered my name. You gotta show us the way outta here Chris.If we could create a diversion, we could get to that jeep and drive it right over there...Yeah, but... And with'that, Speedman runs out in to the courtyard,.. the opposite direction from the jeep, doing a CRAZY WAR'.they're blanks... There is a long moment of silence as the guards just stare at Speedman. He seems a. bit surprised that. they are not dead,. as do the guards themselves. They cock their weapons, about to shoot him when.,.. A HAIL OF-BULLET FIRE-erupts-behind-the-gu-ards... They turn...WE REVEAL CODY AND FOUR LEAF BEHIND THEM, THEIRLet's move! The.guys jump into the jeep, Sandusky at the wheel, and 'gun it..Chris, come.on! Speedman jumps. into the jeep as it passes by. They are speeding toward the helipad.Get in the Jeep!Start the chopper now Cody! Cody nods, getting his bearings... and hitting the ignition...the BLADES SLOWLY HUM TO LIFE, BEGINNING TO TURN...
