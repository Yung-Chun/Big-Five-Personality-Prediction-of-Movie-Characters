And he's totally screwed because his tongue is stuck to the mailbox.I don't know. Maybe he had OCD and he was obsessed with licking mailboxes.Are you gonna let me tell the story?An then, he hears a horrible sound. Snap, snap, drag. Snap, snap, drag. Lobsterman is coming.He's trapped. If he doesn't rip the skin off his tongue and make a run for it lobsterman will tear him to pieces with his razor sharp claws.It's about time. I thought your class got over at 9:30.Said he was scared. I think he was fakin' it though.I'm not taking money.Nothing.It was just Mr. Kim being a dick head.Yeah, before Mrs. Kim started working there. Now he's a full on gym teacher, I swear to God.Oh please, you love it when I fuck up. Love it. Me screwing up gives you the hugest woody.There was a diner scene earlier. With a waitress.Completely pie free.Rose, you buy generic cigarettes with couch change. How are you gonna pay for private school?No thanks.I don't think you're in any position to feel superior.You are so out of touch.Think they loved each other?I'm sleeping.What do you want?I'm sleeping.No.You suck.You still suck.You didn't get me coffee?Of course I...How long is this gonna take?There is no way.Maybe if you'd gotten me a coffee.I'm standing here.What do we do with that?It seems wrong though doesn't it... to throw everything away.I bet this is her.Wow, look at this.Think it's her daughter?Shouldn't we do something? Try to find her or something?What if she doesn't know? Wouldn't you want to know if this was mom?I wonder how she died?Smelly.Stinky.Great. You freaked him out.Turns out it's against the law to throw bio hazards in the dumpster. Who knew?How perfect was he with the one arm?The creepy guy. Do you think he was born like that?Dude, he has one arm.We are a couple of hacks.Stop here.I gotta thing. Just drop me off here.You have class tonight?Heather's pregnant again. Did you know that? He's never going to leave her.God, you're pathetic.What?I'm not following you.What?That's all right.No. No I don't.It was a mistake. No big deal.Let's press the alarm button.Me? No.Hobby...There's this gorilla who knows sign language and I've always thought that would have to be the most amazing thing ever. You know? To actually talk to a gorilla.KoKo.Kitten died. It wasn't KoKo's fault. She was heartbroken.That's what's so cool about it.No, don't... it's fine.Not exactly.Oh, excellent.Bow-chicka-bow-bow. Can I drive?Ice Cream Hut!How cool to live across from the Ice Cream Hut.Yeah well, what about Dad?Ahh! Lick around the base. Secure the perimeter. Don't you teach this kid anything?Yeah.My sister.Had I known about the juice boxes...I just wanted to give her the pictures.Relax, I didn't give them to her.It's just three blocks away.It's not like I'm never gonna see you.It just means your mom wasn't married when she had you. It's no big deal. In a couple of years you're gonna find it's a free pass to cool. You'll probably start a band called Bastard Son. Use it to impress the chicks. Trust me, the whole bastard thing... it's working for you.What was that?She okay?You made it seem so fun.Oh my God, is that the needle? It's a fucking cocktail straw.You might have oversold it.Feels hot.My friend's having a thing tonight.Never mind.Nothing it's...You wouldn't like it.I knew you wouldn't have any fun here.Lambs breath.Straight edge?She's Mormon.What?You don't drink?All right, you're kind of freakin me out.You should just tell people you're Mormon.Yes. Yes, he is.I need more beer.Um. Can I get you anything?Shh.Hello.Yeah, I'm watching it now.We are.You went to that thing.Wait. I thought you went to that thing.I thought you went to the thing.What do you mean you went to part of it? It was a one day thing.Side tracked?Oh my God, you humped Carl!That's disgusting.Sure.On so many levels.Listen, Randy I think we should stop hanging out.Yeah, I don't. I should, but I don't. And you're a really great guy. But...I don't care if you have sex with the rabbit lady... and I mean, it seems like I should care about that.Ever been trestling?No. The person is gone. It's weird `cuz we're connected to them in this strangely intimate way... but we never actually meet them. It's just kind of weird.I have seen a dead body once though.My mom.She was in a movie of the week once, ya know.A bunch of Hollywood people were filming down in Old Town. They thought my mom was so beautiful and so talented that they gave her a speaking part. You want to hear it?`I recommend the pecan pie.'That was her line. It was on TV and everything.Me and Rose, we didn't actually see it but Rose says mom talked about it all the time. I don't remember.I don't remember her much at all. I have this box of her stuff though, little things she touched. When it seems like she never even really existed... it's proof.All right. This is where we climb.Up to that girder.Best place to be when it comes.You're gonna miss the best part.It's like... it's like this big pissed off God up in your face just screaming at you. So close you can smell the metal on his breath.It is. I'm telling you.I didn't mean to bum you out with the whole mom stuff. I just thought you would... I don't know, I guess I thought...He's coming.Rose, wait for me.Sneaky fucker.I think I broke my hand.No. But it hurts like a mother.Ow!I just... I found them. I was gonna tell you.At work.We did this job a while back. This woman...I wanted to tell you... that first day. That's why I--I think... You know, I think there's a reason that I found them. The pictures. Because that lead me to you, right?Wait. Please. Don't...I--Blow off the shower.So tell him we can't do it.So, don't go to the damn baby shower. It's not like you ever even liked Paula.Shit.Oh my God, you're the cutest thing ever. Did you get left behind?It's okay.No, no, no.FUCK!It was an accident.It was an accident.Jesus Rose, Calm down.Well, if you had been here to help me but no, you're off desperately trying to impress stupid high school people who don't even matter. Prove to your old cheerleading squad that you're not this huge loser. If you had been here doing your job it wouldn't have happened. So don't try to put all this on me.Oh, go ahead and play the martyr. It's like your favorite thing.I am so sick of all your holier than thou bullshit. Why don't you take a look at you're own life, huh? You're a real inspiration.Fuck you. I'm done being your excuse.No.I need to talk to Lynn.Why are you acting like this? Why haven't you called me back.What's that supposed to mean?Here.Sorry I'm late.Hey.Winston cleans up pretty good.I read somewhere that beauty is really all about symmetry. Like having eyes the same size and all that. So, you know, when you factor that in he's like, hot.Listen, I know I fucked up, okay? Like really huge and I know that and I'm sorry, okay?I really am sorry. But it really isn't all my fault, Rose.You finished?What are you going to do now?I've got my own ideas.Winston? No.You gonna open my present?The guy said that if you're careful they'll last a whole month. And these aren't stupid kiddie unicorns and shit.

If you say so.Legally, it's not really necessary.We're in the process.We adhere to all the proper procedures when dealing with a potentially hazardous situation. We are very professional.Are you guys all finished?Why don't you grab the wet-vac and I'll start bagging the loose stuff.I did. I mean, I went to part of it. Most of it.I got side tracked.That Above and Beyond guy was there. Carl. We got talking shop and--I'm already registered for the next one.I'm sorry, I don't mean to bother you. I just wanted to let you know that we're all finished up and--We can come back later if that's better.I'm so sorry for your loss.You want a Coke?Dammit.What did you guys do today?How's it without Norah here?Shit.What are you doing here?Oscar's asleep.How's the baby?They are.

State Farm! Yes. Hello.Yes! Hi. What can I do for you?Great. No problem.Shit, shit, shit.Honey, call grampa.I can't I... I RSVPed.It's an insurance company. They could throw us a ton of work.

Make sure that the area is clean and sanitary.People just don't understand the health and safety risks involved in disposing of biological material like blood and body fluids.Course, we have a whole arsenal of disinfectants and um... professional techniques. Like I said, it's a highly technical and professional operation with a whole complicated, you know... methodology behind it.Real growth industry.Yeah.I do. We come into the lives of people who have just experienced something so sad and profound. They've lost somebody. The circumstances are different but that's the same.And we help them. In this one small way... we help.Sorry.Hello, you've reached Sunshine Cleaning. You're call is very important to us so...You know what? I... uh...Actually, there's somewhere I need to be.Yeah. Well... Yeah.Oh my God, what have you done?How does this happen? Huh? How do you burn down a house, Norah? Jesus fucking Christ!This is on you. You did this. You set a fucking house on fire! You.I can't believe I was so stupid to think that you could handle a little bit of responsibility.Well maybe if I didn't have to take care of everybody in this family.Oh that's great. Turn everything to shit and then walk away.Great.I'm sorry, I... everything's horrible.Norah's ruined everything. She burnt down a house. A client's house.You know?How does he...?That's just great. We burnt down a client's house. How do you get around that?I figured we'd wait and get the better rate once I got certified.There's not a lot I'm really good at, you know.Really. I'm good at getting guys to want me. Not date or marry me. But want me. I've always been good at that.And cheering. I was pretty good at that too.Yeah. Not as marketable as you'd think.You brush your teeth?Long day.It's not really a good time.It's beautiful.No, I like it very much.It's just this thing we're doing.I don't want this anymore.Thanks. For everything.We're going to Hinkle's Saturday for Oscar's birthday. It'd be great if you came.Dad, you promised him those others. From the store. He's been talking about it for weeks.God, that drives me crazy! That whole `Oh, I'm sorry, I'm just a big fuck up' routine. Like that's a legitimate excuse.I think there's something wrong with you. The way your brain works. I mean, what the hell? It's like you can't be trusted with anything. You just screw around all the time like it's all a big fucking game. It wasn't a game, Norah. We're not all just here for your amusement. You should have been paying attention. You should have been focused on the job.I know. I should have been there.I got some ideas. I was thinking maybe we could--So, you really think he's hot?What's that say?Cool.How?I'm selling the van.Have to. Can't afford the payment.Turn your TV on. Channel sixty- five.Hello? Mom?Oscar turned eight today. We had this whole big thing at Hinkle's. Winston came. After dinner Oscar and Norah got a high score on Centipede and put in ASS as their initials and got in trouble by the manager. I don't know if you're in heaven or what. But you're not here and that's too bad for you `cuz you've missed out. You've missed out on some really great stuff.Dad?Okay.What?You lost the house. Oh my god, you lost the house.
