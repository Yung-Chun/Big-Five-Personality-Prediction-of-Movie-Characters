Sophia, our daughter was born there. Claudio was kind and loving, and we were happy... We were there four years when the civil war broke out... The guerrillas were all around us, but left us alone... Then they made an attack on the army nearby. The next night, soldiers came to our village. They were led by American 'advisors'... They accused us of helping the rebels. Our women were raped. Our men were tortured. Our homes were burned... We crawled out into the fields, but they threw grenades, and Sophia...... my baby girl was hit by shrapnel... she bled to death in Claudio's arms.Claudio joined the guerrillas. When that war ended, we moved to the next war, and the next... Each fight has only deepened his hatred. And poisoned his soul. He's unable to love anything anymore...Because I know he was a good man, who's been consumed by rage because of what he lost... Just like you.Not yet.I tried to stop him.He's gone back.Yes....
